2024-12-27,23:21:44,WallStreetBets,AAPL,Apple,gsat the overlooked satellite company with extraterrestrial potential tldr globalstars outsized role in lowearth orbit communications and recent equity partnership with apple will provide substantial future cash flows and support rapid growth price target is 5 but will very likely extend far above this valuation globalstar gsat provides mobile satellite services through its satellite constellations worldwide more specifically they provide cellular data and enable cellular communication satellite monitoring of ground assets by governments emergency service to remote areas and utilization of their frequency spectrums authorized by the fcc and itu most importantly globalstar recognizes revenue from its spectrums under the wholesale capacity services segment and its respective 5137 and 3137 increases for the 39 month periods ending in 2024 compared to 2023 illustrates its importance as a driver of operating profits revenue has been steadily increasing even through rocky macroeconomics authorizations for ownership of terrestrial spectrums are often lengthy endeavors and require a demonstration of competence by any company seeking them the fact that globalstar has secured lband and sband spectrum authorizations gives it a massive competitive advantage and access to a wider variety of international populations and markets than competitors in addition to this competitive advantage apple recently initiated a 20 stake in the company and provided them with 11 billion in funding paid in quarterly installments to pay down debts and for use of their services this 20 equity stake emphasizes that apple views globalstar as a company with significant growth potential rather than a simple operating partner and its not just apple buying in either institutional ownership of globalstar is up across the board with names like jpmorgan and fidelity rebalancing their investments and taking stakes outright i believe that globalstars current undervaluation is due to its historic balance sheet weakness and continued share dilution however the 11b in funding from apple provides it with a solid runway and cushion from debt more recently they filed to effect a reverse stock split this split would address their ongoing share dilution issues provide additional liquidity for lot trading blocks of 100 shares that benefit from lower commissions and fees and a path to nasdaq listing i believe that this companys valuation currently reflects outdated historic data and is not priced appropriately given these most recent developments the consensus price target is currently set at 5 but having been beaten down for nearly 2 decades i would expect any spark to ignite a rally that extends far above this target

2024-12-27,16:18:54,WallStreetBets,NVDA,NVIDIA,nvidias gpu monster is about to come out of the cage and todays prices will be its starting point the nvidia blackwell b300 series processors excel in a number of ways that make them an important breakthrough in ai big data and hyperscale computing 1 dramatic performance improvements the b300 series delivers a 50 increase in compute performance over the b200 series this performance increase is not only achieved through more compute cores and higher clock frequencies but also through a more optimized 4np process nvidias custom 4nm process for applications that need to process complex ai models the b300 delivers more efficient computing power especially in the areas of machine learning deep learning and highperformance computing 2 extra memory and bandwidth the b300 is equipped with a 12hi hbm3e memory stack providing 288gb of memory and 8tbs of bandwidth the increased memory capacity enables it to handle larger datasets making it particularly suitable for training large language models llms and handling long sequence inference tasks higher memory bandwidth accelerates data access and processing reduces latency and improves model inference and training efficiency 3 lower inference cost since the b300 supports processing larger batches and extended sequence lengths it significantly reduces latency in the inference process and lowers inference costs for example the ability to triple inference efficiency allows the full computational power of each gpu to be utilized thus reducing the cost required to generate the number of tokens per second 4 innovative interconnect technology the b300 utilizes the 800g connectx8 nic which provides twice the bandwidth of its predecessor for largescale clusters and supports more pcie lanes 48 instead of 32 this enables more efficient data sharing across multiple gpus significantly improving overall cluster throughput and computing efficiency making it ideal for largescale distributed and cloud computing applications 5 more flexible supply chain and customization nvidia has changed its traditional sales model by no longer supplying complete server hardware but instead offering core components such as sxm puck modules and grace cpus to oems and odms allowing customers to customize them according to their needs this change brings higher flexibility and scalability to better adapt to the needs of different enterprises especially for hyperscale data centers and cloud computing vendors where customization can improve overall performance and efficiency 6 higher scalability for hyperscale organizations the b300s nvlink 72 nvl72 architecture enables 72 gpus to collaborate on the same problem with low latency compared to traditional 8 gpu configurations the b300 significantly improves batch size scalability reduces costs and increases the intelligence of the inference chain this makes the b300 computationally and economically efficient for largescale inference tasks 7 efficient cooling and energy management although the power consumption of the b300 series has increased tdp of 1400w the b300 is able to dynamically allocate and adjust power between the cpu and gpu to maximize overall energy efficiency thanks to a more efficient dynamic power allocation mechanism additionally its design allows for a more efficient water cooling system which helps reduce operating costs and improve system stability value proposition improved computing efficiency the b300 series is capable of handling larger datasets and more complex ai models making it suitable for organizations that require highperformance computing such as those in the areas of deep learning inference services largescale ai model training and other applications reduced inference costs with higher memory capacity and bandwidth the b300 significantly reduces the cost per inference and improves economics which is a huge valueadd for cloud providers or organizations offering ai services flexible customization nvidias new supply chain model enables organizations to choose the most appropriate hardware configuration for their needs reducing overall procurement costs and increasing flexibility underpinning hyperscale computing the b300 is a significant technology upgrade for data centers cloud giants and other hyperscale computing platforms eg amazon google meta helping them scale compute capacity more efficiently and improve performance in summary the b300 series not only brings significant improvements in multiple aspects such as performance memory bandwidth and energy management but also provides greater adaptability and scalability through a flexible supply chain and customized design helping enterprises achieve higher efficiency and lower operating costs in largescale computing and ai applications

2024-12-26,16:05:33,WallStreetBets,AAPL,Apple,congrats to the new 1b space stock finally hit a billy been waiting on this for years rdw is the next space stock you need to watch bigger than asts or rklb note tried originally posting this on 1014 1104 and 1130 and wsb told me i couldnt because rdw was under 500m market cap which is wasnt now trading 10 a share ive been following rdw redwire for four years now ever since it ipod via a spac i originally owned the stock back at the ipo sold it before it fully crashed down to 2 and repurchased 10000 shares at 250 ive bought and sold on the way up and on dips currently holding 4500 shares with a cost basis of 383 i also hold two call contracts at a 4 strike price expiring in may 2025 im a longterm believer in rdw and believe it has the potential to be one of the biggest winners in the space industry long term with significant potential for shortterm spikes this post isnt about denouncing other space stocks but more about why i believe rdw can be the winner we all want and need note before diving in this was originally written on oct 14 2024 ive since updated this with current numbers as of nov 30 2024 my portfolio in the space sector oct 14 2024 to show you my broader conviction in space heres a quick rundown of my other holdings in the space sector rklb 4500 shares 4 call contracts at 250 strike and 2 at 5 strike expiring in jan 2026 asts 1000 shares cost basis 12 sold 2000 shares at 35 on a pump lunr sold 5000 shares and 10 call contracts at 5 on a recent contract pump sold another 5000 shares 147 portfolio holdings update as of nov 30 rdw 4500 shares 2 call contracts at 4 strike expiring may 2025 rklb 3100 shares 2 call contracts at 25 strike expiring jan 2026 2 call contracts at 7 strike expiring jan 2027 sold 500 15 500 20 400 235 bought achr 1000 shares 618 joby 750 shares 721 kulr 4000 shares 055 gsat 2000 189 sold all of my asts 1000 shares 30 lunr 5000 shares 147 but my strongest conviction remains with rdw and heres why rdw performance key financials redwire has shown strong revenue growth but its flying under the radar compared to almost every single one of its peers heres a breakdown of recent financials 2023 revenue 2438 million 519 yoy net loss 273 million adjusted ebitda 153 million q1 2024 revenue 878 million 524 yoy net loss 81 million adjusted ebitda 43 million q2 2024

revenue 7307 million q2 2024 revenue 41 million asts 2023 revenue 0 q1 2024 revenue 500 thousand q2 2024 revenue 900 thousand valuation insights why rdw is undervalued now lets talk about valuation when looking at revenue versus market cap rdw is trading at a much lower multiple than its peers despite earning more and losing less than almost all of them this presents a strong case for potential upside if the market starts to recognize its growth rdw market cap 5243m as of oct 14 at 788share as of nov 30 market cap is now 9289m revenue multiple just 169x revenue as of nov 30 revenue multiple is 3x for comparison rklb 10x revenue as of nov 30 25x asts 100x revenue lunr 225x revenue as of nov 30 45x why this matters a lower revenue multiple suggests that rdw is currently undervalued relative to its peers its trading at just 169x revenue compared to rklbs 10x or spces 15x despite immense market traction and success if redwire continues on its growth trajectory this gap in valuation could close quickly creating a significant upside opportunity proven track record rdw has been involved in space missions for more than 50 years supporting missions to practically every planet in our solar system sun 3 missions mercury 2 missions venus 3 missions earth 20 missions iss 12 missions moon 4 missions mars 7 missions asteroids 3 jupiter 2 saturn 1 pluto 1 theyre also

supporting dod satellite supply chain darpa sabresat very low orbit demonstration nasa mars surfaceimaging study european space agency esa robotic arm prototype for lunar lander capabilities future potential redwire is also positioned to be a leader in several emerging space technologies including multiple areas ive seen highlighted for other companies in wsb over the years their capabilities include microgravity payload development and operations very low earth orbit vleo platforms europeanbuilt very low earth orbit vleo spacecraft platform called phantom manufacturing and pharma

founding corporate sponsors of the center for aerospace autonomy research at stanford university recently acquired hera systems a spacecraft developer other advanced rf payloads to a leading european defense contractor european satellite delivery planetary defense redwire is positioned as a leader in several emerging space technologies that could be gamechangers in the next decade the possibilities here are immenseespecially with spacebased manufacturing pharma and autonomous operations becoming key areas of growth in the sector the opportunity why now is the time with everything mentioned above rdw presents a major opportunity but heres why now could be the time to get in outstanding shares 6654m float 2426m very small compared to peers rklb 340m asts 122m lunr 57m short interest 258m shares 1062 of float as of nov 30 short interest is 3m 12 of float average daily volume 340k very low compared to peers lunr 142m rklb 131m asts 169m average daily volume as of nov 30 481k lunr 1918m rklb 1852m asts 1283m low float and low trading volume make rdw more prone to sharp price movements especially if the market starts to recognize the value thats been overlooked add to that the upcoming earnings reports and potential contracts in the pipeline and you have a recipe for significant price action conclusion given rdws impressive revenue growth proven track record undervaluation compared to peers and potential for shortterm spikes due to low float and trading volume this is a stock to keep an eye on while i hold positions in other space stocks my conviction in rdw remains the strongest for longterm growth past jan 1 2024 296 1969m market cap lower than the 2023 revenue oct 14 788 5243m market cap today nov 30 1396 9289m market cap future potential 20 133b

2024-12-27,15:59:14,StockMarket,NVDA,NVIDIA,was amd misplaced after a cumulative 15 drop this year its time to bottom out and rebound amds nasdaq amd stellar management team will be in the spotlight as intel intc looks for its next ceo its important to have stable management and a clear direction for the company over the past few years intel has changed ceos frequently leading to shifting priorities and ultimately hurting the companys growth potential on the other hand amds shares have risen 50 times since zf su took over as ceo in 2014 over the past few quarters amd has rapidly expanded its ai division and is on track for strong results in 2025 amd is down 15 percent yeartodate compared to a 25 percent return for the sp 500 amd forecasts 5 billion in ai revenue by 2024 most analysts expect ai revenue in 2025 to be close to 10 billion however this number seems to be underestimated as amd prepares to launch the next generation of its powerful mi325 and mi350 family of chips demand for amds chips is very strong and were likely to hear from more major customers in the near term amd could realize nearly 1415 billion in ai revenue by 2025 despite limited supply amd stock is trading at less than 17 times fiscal year ending december 2026 earnings per share estimates despite strong growth momentum and an expectation that eps will more than double over the next two years amd stock is underperforming in 2024 but if the company is able to beat its ai revenue forecasts we could see huge bullish momentum in the coming quarters amd stock has pulled back nearly 30 after its recent earnings call which was a significant pullback despite the companys good earnings results this is a significant pullback despite the companys decent earnings results one of the reasons for the drop in amds stock price is that wall street expects amds ai chip sales to be modest by 2025 most recently bank of america downgraded amd because it predicted amd would lose market share to hyperscale manufacturers that prefer to use their own custom chips in data centers hyperscale manufacturers contribute nearly 50 percent of nvidias data center revenue and are the main reason for nvidias huge revenue and earnings per share growth almost all hyperscale manufacturers are developing their own custom chips for cloud business or other core computing needs however amd still offers good value to these hyperscale manufacturers due to significantly lower chip prices compared to nvidia and greater flexibility compared to nvidias cuda platform amd also has a small market share in the ai chip industry compared to nvidia even if some hyperscalers choose their chips this provides the company with good room for growth what could change wall streets view of amd analysts believe the next earnings call will be important as it will give management a chance to lay out plans for ai growth in the coming quarters and amd will likely be able to beat wall streets expectations for ai revenue if amd is able to achieve 15 billion or more in ai revenues by 2025 this would lead to a rapid shift in market sentiment and we could see a significant rally in the stock amd has been managed very well under zf sus leadership normally analysts dont mention this factor but its becoming increasingly important as intel searches for another ceo after nearly four years of pat kissingers tenure amd shares have risen 50fold since su zifeng joined the company in 2014 we dont often see dramatic changes like this in the corporate world analysts think intels foundry strategy was a mistake the foundry business requires tens of billions of dollars in capital expenditures and it takes a long time to achieve good results intel doesnt have that kind of time theres also the issue of opportunity cost intel was busy expanding its foundry business and missed out on the ai opportunity amds management is much more flexible and quickly moved to the ai business once it showed great potential its worth noting that amd has been able to exceed their own projections when it comes to ai revenues at the end of 2023 amd announced that they expect ai revenues to reach 2 billion by 2024 this number has been increasing throughout the year and during the most recent earnings season management announced that amd would realize 5 billion in ai revenue by 2024 in just 12 months weve seen amds ai forecasts grow 25x this demonstrates the companys ability to rapidly increase chip supply and gain a good customer base much of amds future growth will come from its ai business so its important to properly assess the potential of that business an earlier market watch report noted that susquehanna analyst christopher rolland estimated that amds ai revenue could reach 9 billion by 2025 with 1112 billion unlikely oppenheimers rick schafer said 10 billion would be a difficult number to achieve and piper sandlers harsh kumar estimated amds ai revenues would reach 102 billion by 2025 most estimates are closer to 10 billion and if amd can achieve higher ai revenues in 2025 that would be a big boost to sentiment two important factors in amds favor are flexibility and value amd offers more flexibility to hyperscalers who dont want to be tied to nvidias cuda platform which is considered a strong moat for the company but which could also end up limiting customer choice another important factor is value nvidias h100 costs four times as much as rival amd chips with hyperscalers ordering thousands of these chips getting better value out of them is important to maintain your margins and gain a competitive edge amd will increase sales of its mi325 and mi350 series in 2025 this will provide a strong boost to the companys ai revenue if amds ai revenues approach 14 billion to 15 billion in 2025 we could see the stock provide very strong bullish momentum the company has consistently outperformed both market expectations and its own forecasts for ai revenue and amd could outperform the markets general expectations in the ai space in 2025 rapid sales of ai chips will inevitably help boost amds margins and earnings per share in the coming quarters the market generally expects amds earnings per share to grow 55 percent next year and another 38 percent in 2026 this would increase earnings per share for the fiscal year ending december 2026 to 705 per share at that eps the expected pricetoearnings ratio is less than 17 times which is very modest for one of the major ai players in the industry amds revenues and operating income have turned an inflection point as the data center division has increased its share of revenues overall revenue grew from 58 billion a year ago to 68 billion in the most recent quarter despite the poor performance of the gaming and embedded divisions this is thanks to the data center division which more than doubled its revenue to 35 billion in the most recent quarter compared to the same period last year operating income was more heavily impacted by recent earnings indicating a lucrative data center business amds ai division is facing a number of positives and is expected to beat market expectations in 2025 this could improve operating income and eps trends in the coming quarters making amd stock a good choice at current prices amds strong and stable management has delivered better results over the past few years compared to intel unlike intel which is trying to expand its expensive foundry business amd has also made better strategic decisions by focusing on its artificial intelligence business most analysts estimate that amds ai revenue in 2025 will be close to 10 billion that number may be underestimated as the company accelerates development of its nextgeneration ai chips amd offers flexibility and value to hyperscale organizations which increases the appeal of its ai chips its pricetoearnings ratio is less than 17 times for the fiscal year ending december 2026 which is quite modest for a company that is growing earnings per share rapidly and is a core part of the ai industry

2024-12-25,09:09:20,StockMarket,NVDA,NVIDIA,whats your opinion on too many etfs i love etfs and i attempt to diversify my portfolio with a variety of them while i try to keep it simple there are some etfs that attract me for various reasons obviously a low expense ratio is nice and i focus on high aum and long term records but assuming a variety of quality etfs there is an argument that too many is bad and i frankly cant understand the logic behind it the argument is that it can overexpose certain positions or dilute performance but lets think about that there are two situations lets use simple numbers 1 i invest 10000 in etf a which happens to have 10 allocation in nvda among other things and 10 in etf b which has 5 allocation in nvda among other things this gives me 20k of assets with 75 average exposure to nvda 2 i invest 20000 in either etf a or b this gives me either 10 or 5 in nvda obviously the same holds true for the rest of the top holdings you get the average so i cant see what the argument against too many efs is if youre in a and the top holding does well youve made more money if youre in b youve missed out on gains if youre in both you get the average sure you may miss out on profits but most of the quality etfs have a lot of overlap anyways so whether i invest it all in one or spread the allocation im still getting in the same stocks at the top at least by spreading it across multiple etfs i can get a chance to diversify more in the bottom 50 holdings so whats your thoughts is this really an issue feedback on my current breakdown below currently i have about 45 in voo vt vthr about 15 in 2 dividend etfs 25 in qqq about 5 in one sector growth etf speculation and about 5 spread across 8 other growth speculation etfs so overall im in 19 etfs but id say the bulk are in 4 core etfs with a handful of others augmenting each category and then the others are diverse and classified by category with only a small going towards speculation and even those are diversified in various sectors the simple breakdown would be 45 sp 15 dividend 35 growth 25 10 spec 3 individual stocks and 2 emergency fund i should probably add that there are 0 trade fees and no annual account expenses or penalties beyond just the expense ratio of the etf all of which are mostly between 003 and 010 with a few exceptions and those exeptions make up a smaller weight of the portfolio if anything id argue that having more gives you more variety to buy different areas of your portfolio for dollar cost averaging when certain areas arent doing as well

2024-12-24,15:32:27,StockMarket,NVDA,NVIDIA,can nvidia continue its rise morgan stanley stated that nvidias blackwell chip will be the companys biggest highlight in 2025 with the success of this nextgeneration gpu expected to overshadow any remaining investor concerns this week the bank reiterated its overweight rating on nvidias stock stating that the chipmaker remains one of its top picks for 2025 the optimism is driven by expectations of the success of blackwellnvidias nextgeneration ai chip the bank set a target price of 166 per share a 23 increase from nvidias price of approximately 13482 as of last friday when shortterm data is volatile but the fundamentals are very strong we are most optimistic about nvidia we believe we are approaching that stage now the analysts wrote in their report despite transitional pressures by the second half of 2025 the only topic will be the strong performance of blackwell investors are already optimistic about the blackwell chip which is expected to launch in early 2025 earlier this year nvidias stock surged after ceo jensen huang said the demand for the chip was crazy boosting wall streets expectations for sustained profitability growth for nvidia morgan stanley added that the chip could become the core driver of revenue in the second half of next year suggesting significant upside potential for the stock price the success of the new chip could also alleviate some of the shortterm to mediumterm concerns investors have regarding nvidias stock morgan stanley pointed out that investors are primarily focused on four key issues 1 slowing production of hopper chips investors are concerned about the slowdown in production of nvidias current generation ai chip hopper in the latest earnings call the company forecasted a 695 growth in revenue for the fourth quarter the lowest in seven quarters however morgan stanley stated that the slowdown in hopper chip production is a nonissue the reason is simple we are a few quarters away from the end of hoppers lifecycle we wont directly link hopper production to revenue because hoppers revenue will last for about three quarters additionally there is a significant backlog of orders so now is the time to slow down production the analysts wrote 2 different versions of blackwell chips not shipping simultaneously investors may be concerned that not all blackwell products will ship at the same time nvidia has stated that it will release seven different variants of the blackwell gpu we have heard concerns that some products may not be ready and we do not deny that there may be timing challenges for some types of products the analysts said they added this is a reasonable concern but all blackwell chips will be sold even if this results in distribution changes among customers we expect this to continue for a whole year and it should not be a longterm concern morgan stanley stated that by the second half of 2025 concerns about the blackwell launch will completely disappear 3 competitors eroding nvidias value the analysts noted that in recent months part of nvidias market value has shifted to other chipmakers such as broadcom and marvell these companies produce asic custom ai chips which are alternatives to nvidias gpus but by 2025 we believe the largest users of asics will actually shift their purchases back to gpus said morgan stanley while we are relatively conservative in our revenue forecasts for broadcom and marvells asics we believe gpus will significantly outperform asics this year 4 reduced chip demand large ai chip customers are expanding their gpu clusters for more advanced computing however some financial supporters question whether the return on investment is worth it morgan stanley noted both of these aspects are important and we cannot rule out the possibility of market consolidation in certain areas the analysts said but we note that many of nvidias recent innovations have aimed at improving the efficiency of large clusters they added pointing to nvidias acquisition of mellanox which will help expand its data center market share the analysts stated even with concerns about a cooling arms race in agi the growth in inference sovereign training and enterprise training applications are multiyear growth drivers accounting for about 70 of data center revenue even if the arms race consolidates we will still see sustained growth potential despite nvidias stock price having surged 170 in 2024 most analysts remain optimistic about nvidia in 2025 the continued ai trade frenzy is expected to be one of the major themes influencing the stock market in 2025 4o

2024-12-21,00:28:54,StockMarket,NVDA,NVIDIA,pe ratios in the tech sector alright guys and girls im looking for some of the big investors on here with high 6 or even 7 figure plus portfolios im wondering what folks with a lot more time in the market are thinking about the pe ratios for some of these tech companies in various etfs vgt from vanguard for example or even voovti im not too worried about the players like apple microsoft etc they have always seemed to have such deamand that they run a pe in the 30s50s but some of these companies like amd at pe 100 broadcom 170 nvidia shooting up into the 50s so quickly with massive investment is just limited supply and crazy demand for these shares are you concerned as investors i had to close out portfolios 5 years ago to go back to school and pay for it without taking on debt i just got back in last year and have 200k in the market and with our income now 600k to 700k per year we intend to keep maxing out everything and also contribute to brokerage accounts 200k a year total min with 401ks roths brokerage account
2024-12-20,19:20:04,StockMarket,TSLA,Tesla,every monday morning i invest 1885 here is how i divvy it up can yall provide feedbackopinions on my investing strategy please im an early 30s single guy with a solid income i invest 188500 every week which amounts to roughly half of my take home pay and i live off the other half i live in a very high cost of living city and i rent an apartment ive got a very long time horizon so im trying to be aggressive here is how i divvy my money stock amount invested percentage of investment sp 500 etf voo 700 3714 nasdaq 100 etf qqqm 400 2122 mag 6 no tesla 180 30 each 955 small caps avuv 120 637 bitcoin etf ibit 100 530 financial sector etfs xlf and iai 80 40 each 4244 semiconductors etf smh 80 4244 individual stock picks i like 15 in total listed below 225 15 each 1194 total 1885 100 the difference between xlf and iai is that xlf is mostly financial services such as jp morgan visa mastercard bank of america wells fargo etc whereas iai is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as goldman sachs morgan stanley schwab sp global etc there is only a 15 overlap between these two etfs the 15 companies i like that i invest 15 each into are adobe adbe amd amd broadcom avgo chipotle cmg salesforce crm door dash dash netflix nflx servicenow now palo alto networks panw palantir pltr shopify shop sofi bank sofi uber uber i think at first glance some will say that there is a little redundancy here such as investing in the mag 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in voo and qqq which both contain the mag 6 as their largest holdings each this is a fair criticism although i do this intentionally because i want more of a slant towards these companies so i get higher exposure by also investing in them individually in addition to the exposure i get from the index funds im open to feedback from others im trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why i invest in the mag 6 and the 15 companies i like while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 5836 of my money in the sp and nasdaq getting small cap exposure exposure to the financial sector so that i am not exclusively in tech and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin it is 100 linked to bitcoin please provide any thoughts or constructive criticism below thank you
2024-12-20,15:45:21,StockMarket,TSLA,Tesla,can tesla bounce back quickly tesla stock has been on a recent surge especially after trumps victory with shares soaring from 24623 to 487 a gain of nearly 97 this rise has been largely driven by politics particularly musks relationship with trump but the question is how long will this premium due to politics last teslas future is also closely tied to fully selfdriving fsd if fsd is successfully rolled out and receives regulatory approval tesla could transform into an online car company which would be a steady source of cash flow however regulatory issues and technology rollout remain challenges although teslas stock price has risen sharply analysts have mixed views on its outlook barclays maintains a neutral rating believing that teslas stock price is out of touch with the companys fundamentals with a price target of 270 cfra on the other hand is more optimistic about tesla raising its price target to 560 believing that the elimination of the electric vehicle tax credit will help tesla expand its market share going forward tesla could be at risk of a stock price correction but if fsd goes smoothly and there are no regulatory hurdles teslas longterm outlook remains bullish tesla followed suit in the face of powells news announcement over the past two days when will it return to its high value

2024-12-18,08:50:26,StockMarket,NVDA,NVIDIA,nvidias recent decline and opportunities for a new rally nvidia fell nearly 4 today before narrowing the loss to 122 since hitting a record closing high of 14888 in early november the ai chip makers stock has dropped over 10 so what is causing nvidias decline 1 supply chain issues and challenges nvidia faces multiple challenges in its supply chain a significant factor in its stock decline first according to the latest data the order volume and schedules for the gb200 and gb300 have been adjusted particularly the mass production and shipment of gb series products have been postponed until after the lunar new year in february increasing market uncertainty additionally the smallscale production plans for gb300 face tight deadlines putting pressure on gb200s mass production specific supply chain issues include cowosl packaging technology heating problems copper cable connections and leakage issues these not only affect product yield rates but also increase system integration time costs consequently nvidia has suggested customers purchase the b200 8card hgx as a transitional solution and clients like microsoft are considering switching their orders these supply chain issues affect nvidias product delivery capabilities and reduce market expectations for its future performance 2 market competition and narrative changes asics are gaining market recognition as a competitive narrative asics are chips designed for specific tasks akin to custom running shoes for a race for certain tasks asics outperform nvidias gpus widely used for computing tasks and are potentially cheaper openai cofounder ilya and industry leaders like microsofts ceo satya have started discussing the importance of not only training ai models but also ensuring they can quickly and accurately make decisions in real applications this shift in perspective gives asics an advantage in some scenarios as they are designed for rapid precise execution of tasks this raises questions about the cost of nvidias gpus while powerful they are expensive and require significant electricity and cooling as asics perform better at lower costs for some tasks theres consideration of replacing nvidias gpus with asics additionally changes in scaling law narratives and the strengthening of inference narratives pose threats to nvidia scaling laws suggest that increasing ai model size eg more neurons or layers typically improves performance but these gains are not infinite and require significant computational resources this means nvidia must continually invest resources to improve product performance potentially increasing costs moreover companies like btc tesla and google are investing heavily in their own ai chips or solutions this intensifies market competition and challenges nvidias leadership 3 market sentiment and capital flows market sentiment and capital flow significantly impact nvidias stock price as the year ends retail investors etfs and institutions adjust their portfolios fluctuations in tech giants like microsoft apple and google affect tech stocks like nvidia investors are more cautious favoring stable promising companies given these conditions nvidia faces pressure on its stock price due to supply chain issues and competition lowered expectations for nvidias future performance lead to capital outflows and stock price declines 4 future outlook and catalysts despite current challenges nvidia has opportunities for a turnaround first nvidia needs to resolve supply chain issues improve product yield and delivery capabilities second strengthening its presence in software and applications is crucial to addressing market competition additionally nvidia should explore new computing narratives to expand its computing potential 5 technical analysis and price divergence previously prices rose continuously but volume and kdj began to decline showing divergence without capital support upward momentum was insufficient leading to a shortterm adjustment and a break below the midterm trend line resulting in a midterm adjustment when might a new rally occur from a technical analysis perspective after two prior midterm adjustments breaking the downward trend line may signal the start of a new rally thus this new rally must first break the resistance line from a catalyst perspective while januarys ces and the earnings release in late february may not bring major surprises marchs gtc is worth anticipating nvidia needs to showcase new technologies and products at this event to restore market confidence if nvidia can introduce groundbreaking innovations a stock rebound is possible

2024-12-17,13:59:52,StockMarket,NVDA,NVIDIA,which quantum stock to invest in avoid qubt following on from my recent dd quantum computing inc qubt a lot of messages and a 70 rise in share price that has cooked my puts i decided id dive a bit deeper qubt does not have leading quantum physicists or innovation monroe has more talent in his pinky similar to when evaluating biotechs in the quantum computing industry you need to consider the academic and publishing background of employees quantum computing is a pioneering area of science innovations are typically borne out of research conducted by universities and research centres that are published and reviewed as i explained in my past post qubts staff did not attain their phds at leading universities something which is very important given the quantum computing academic field is relatively small and nascent furthermore even if you thought they might be diamonds in the rough their publication records indicate that they are abysmal researchers see above the citation count of qubts entire quantum employee count is unable to match the citation count of individual founders from competing firms this is a clear indication that their innovations and patents are likely to fail commercially for every technical staff member at qubt there is 42million in market capitalisation bearish signal big capital raises and no hiring furthermore even if i was agnostic on education and publishing background just from a headcount perspective they do not have the people they are the smallest of the four leading small cap quantum firms and despite capital raises including a recent 50 million capital raise and booming stock price they have not shown signs of new hiring the current market cap of 133 billion appears unsustainable and works out to 42 million per technical staff member thats more than my dad made in his entire life where has the money gone if you believe what the company is saying the money from their recent capital raises are going into a foundry dedicated to processing thinfilm lithium niobate tfln chips for use in quantum computing there are a number of commercial lithium niobate suppliers and unlike what they claim on their website suppliers do exist in countries other than china see switzerland usa uk given the relative obscurity of qubts employees it is unlikely that theyll manage to either make functioning chips which they are already falling behind on or beat out their competitors who possess significantly more valuable patents better manufacturing capability and greater commercial links ie with amazon nvidia google also here is what quantum computing incs foundry looks like which notably iceberg research exposed them for lying about its size but would qubt really mislead investors qubt has pivoted many times during its history from beverage company to quantum software artificial intelligence and now quantum chips it naturally begs the question should potential investors believe qubts claims milan begliarbekov the chip foundry director sums up my concerns quite well on his linkedin my advice do not invest the bubble will pop but when is a difficult question to answer

2024-12-09,16:46:43,StockMarket,TSLA,Tesla,qubt is about to crash hard context quantum computing is having its moment its risky but could massively disrupt industries in areas like computing finance and cyber security but stock market bubbles are forming quantum computing is probably the most technically difficult industry for analysts to assess few people are equipped with an adequate understanding of quantum technologies which is leading to massive mispricing qubt is junk quantum computing inc has many problems iceberg researchs recent short report covers some of them they note that the firm has run from one fad to another chips ai computing and failed at each they list several misleading claims that qubt has made and withdrawn the report is damning and raises serious questions about the future of the company i encourage you all to read it however iceberg does not go far enough qubt lacks talent successful quantum innovations requires strong technical knowledge that you really can only come by in either leading universities or megacap firms like google i went through the linkedin profiles of each of qubts employees and compared them with their small cap competitors i tallied up the share of employees that went to an edu rank top100 world universities for quantum physics which is a very broad net qubt ranks incredibly poorly among its peers less than a fifth of employees see picture this is robust to different ranking metrics counting only ivy leagues qubt comes out much worse but look not all employees are on linkedin maybe qubt is the next big underdog no a large share of qubts talent comes from the stevens institute of technology an unremarkable university in new jersey ranked 150 for quantum physics depending on list the companys chief quantum officer is yuping huang on first glance he appears to have a prolific publishing history however most papers receive low citations andor he is third fourth or fifth author huang was previously sued by shareholders for breaching fiduciary duties when he merged his previous company qphoton with qubt notably he is both a qubt director and employee which is a big corporate governance redflag reminds me of sava there is only one independent director with a background in quantum physics to provide checks and balance on huang dr javad shabani he is not up to the task his publishing history is mediocre looking deeper the chief technology officer yong meng sua has an even more mediocre publishing history and has only risen to an assistant professor role at stevens he spends much of his time discussing esoteric computing questions tangential to his work ie the npp problem see their linkedin posts and finally the director of the companys chip foundry iceberg has raised significant questions about the foundry dr milan begliarbekov after finishing high school enrolled in a bachelors degree in english literature at stevens graduated then immediately enrolled in a physics phd at stevens either he is a savant polymath who is able to pick up grad school physics level math or a phd from stevens is worthless his publishing career is very mediocre these scientists will not crack the major problems stopping widespread commercialization of quantum tech simply compare their publishing records to the founder at ionq peter chapman or leading quantum scientists at google alongside the significant and verifiable technological advancements these companies have made another clue that something is amiss is headcount rigetti has three fold the number of employees as qubt qbts has six fold all have similar market cap whats driving value weve established that its not human capital icebergs research reveals its not intellectual property or physical capital either so why has it done so well qubts high valuation is driven by regarded retail investors only 33 of qubt is held by institutional investors and falling compared with 40 for ionq 30 for rgti and 47 for qbts the lack of institutional investment in qubt while institutional investors are simultaneously clamouring to load up on quantum stocks is a massive red flag that something is up with qubt in fact no wall street analysts track qubt so what happens next qubts 800 rise in one month is going to attract short selling interest as people realise its junk the stock will fall back below 1 risk if you want to shortbuy puts you can rest assured that the company is not going to suddenly become profitable the main risk comes from why qubt has done so well despite having little revenue expertise or innovation to show for it qubt is literally called quantum computing incorporated if youre a full regard wanting to invest in quantum computing are you going to invest in ionq what rigetti spaghetti company or a company conveniently called quantum computing its a regard trap its like being interested in electric cars and passing on tesla because you wanted to invest in a stock called electric car co my positions 1000 put contracts to sell 450 cost average 011 expiring dec 20 if this doesnt work im going to buy puts again and again this company sucks im long ionq and after doing this dd i will probably also buy rigetti in the near future couldnt post this in wsb because these stocks only recently became nonpenny stocks

2024-12-06,17:51:07,StockMarket,NVDA,NVIDIA,what would you consider a good entry point for bitcoin bitcoin recently hit a value of 100k as im sure we are all aware by now arguably bitcoin has been one of the most successful investments over the last 10 years up there with nvda and other mag 7 stocks i wont lie ive been a bitcoin hater for most of my investing career its tough to conceptualize fully it has not always been mainstream enough so its understandable to be leery of it and its supporters are so ardent and ravenous that it feels like a cult i dont blame any skeptics for not putting their money into it that said over the last year or two it has certainly gained a ton of legitimacy as it has played a significant role in trumps presidential campaign and also begun to be an asset that hedge funds are also purchasing i like many others i assume want to make it a part of my portfolio but its tough to analyze its value because it doesnt act like your usually security exchanged on the stock market there are no balance sheets or income statements for bitcoin to look at and i have no idea if its valuation is way too high or too low i can certainly see it continuing to go up in the near to mid term future if you told me it would hit 200k in the next two years i wouldnt be surprised that said i also wouldnt be surprised if it also hit 40k in the next two years too is now a good time to buy theres a lot of hype around it after it just hit 100k in value so im nervous about jumping into it right now but im struggling to put together a fair value estimate that i should wait for it to hit before i buy what are your thoughts on this matter

2024-11-11,07:02:39,StockMarket,NVDA,NVIDIA,last weeks high volume stocks tsla tesla saw massive move to the up and it has now gone in over extended territory do not chase and wait for it to dip to support level at 27128 bac crossed over resistance of 4426 and retested that level it should keep going higher under lower interest rate environment my immediate target resistance is at 4724 msft good stock to gostay longs unlike many other stocks thats hitting ath msft still hasnt flown away to hit the ath its not the question if the question is when immediate resistance is at 438439 upst upstart had great earnings and the stock went up by 24 in a day after earnings the next immediate resistance is sitting between 8695 meta meta is going in a range at this point the support is sitting at 558569 and price coming to that area will be nicely bought intc intel had nice weekly bullish candle there are few pivot support levels 2471 2356 2212 my immediate target is at 2786 where it can face some resistance aapl apple has been going in a range we need to look for a breakoutdown a close below 213 is a breakdown whereas close above 238 in daily chart will be a breakout amzn amazon had a breakout above 200 will it retest or continue going higher my target to above sits at 214 for now amd lot of people are looking at amd it had a bullish last week but i believe it still has some more room below before rallying sofi nice weekly breakout do not chase and wait for retest the key level to retest is at 1112 range nvda three weeks ago nvidia had weekly breakout and then it retested those levels before continuation to the upside last week i had given target of 154 last month and i believe it will hit that target
2024-11-11,06:11:25,StockMarket,TSLA,Tesla,im extremely bullish on tsla i just had hand surgery so im writing this onehanded but during my recovery i did nothing but look at tsla charts ive never been a big believer of technical analysis and i know some people ride and die for support levels but honestly i find it can be quite distracting and not very useful in this case however we can notice a pattern of bag holders who have fomod into something theyve wanted to sell for a quick buck and then had to bear the pain sometimes for years a good deal of those sold at a loss at some point but tslas market cap is still made up in some part of people in the red these people have been waiting to cash in for years and at this point theyre not gonna sell unless it at least hits a historic high so i do believe that a price of 400 is at least for now an important support level for this stock and if i know the dudebro culture that is largely responsible of this rally id actually say 420 is an ever more reasonable price within the next 2 months

2024-11-06,13:57:20,StockMarket,TSLA,Tesla,why donald trumps return could boost demand for robots a longterm investment opportunity hey everyone with donald trump making a return i think theres more to consider than just the political drama specifically his policies could have a huge ripple effect on the labor market especially in the service industry trumps stance on illegal immigration means we could see a stronger push to reduce undocumented workers which would lead to an even bigger labor shortage in industries like hospitality food service and logistics if fewer workers are available companies will likely have to fill that gapand robots could be the answer thats where robotics companies come in especially ones like tesla richtech robotics rr and serve robotics tesla is aiming to make waves with its humanoid robots while serve robotics focuses on lastmile delivery solutions in urban areas but lets talk about richtech robotics rr in particular because theyve already got robots deployed and working in realworld environments addressing exactly the kind of labor shortages were talking about rrs service robots are already in use across various industries from restaurants to healthcare facilities and theyre receiving high praise from clients for their reliability and efficiency their tech isnt just conceptualits been tested and proven which gives them a solid foothold as demand grows and then theres elon musk himself if he ends up being involved in government restructuring it wouldnt be surprising to see him push for more automation within federal jobs too given his passion for robotics and ai if musk advocates for more robots in both private and public sectors we could see a huge surge in the robotics industry overall sure the attention is still on djt stocks and virtual currency as shortterm plays riding the trump wave but i see robotics as a sector with way more potential for sustainable growth for those of us looking for longterm positions robots could be the steady play were after especially as the tech gets better and companies like rr serv continue proving their value in realworld applications anyone else seeing this as a big moment to get into robotics stocks for the long haul

2024-10-28,18:26:25,StockMarket,NVDA,NVIDIA,msft faces longterm potential disadvantages i think one of the main reasons microsoft is a great longterm investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow at the time of writing the companys free cash flow margin is over 30 with free cash flow rising from 159 billion in 2009 to 741 billion in the last 12 months this financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments while microsoft may not seem like a value investment in my opinion its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth and its likely to continue for the foreseeable future i estimate eps growth of 13 on a regular basis over the next 12 months based on this projection i have a price target of 48240 and estimate that the stock will trade at a nongaap pe ratio of around 36 looking ahead i expect microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15 over the next 5 to 10 years while this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation i believe the current price provides an opportunity the companys forward nongaap pe ratio is only 65 above its fiveyear average while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 58 msft faces longterm potential headwinds one potential challenge to microsofts longterm growth in ai is that its adoption can be cyclical currently the demand for ai systems is high which has prompted microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion however when the current trend peaks likely due to macroeconomic constraints growth may slow according to the tipranks risk analysis tool microsoft is exposed to 32 risk from legal and regulatory factors which is higher than the industry average and could impact its ai operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and ai governance given this outlook i expect some volatility in microsofts longterm growth trajectory although it may not be as good as nvidia nvda 006 and so on semiconductor companies so obvious as market sentiment fluctuates cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities there is also a risk that microsoft and other big tech players could overinvest in ai infrastructure with 21 of its risk related to tech innovation microsofts heavy investment in aidriven initiatives including data center infrastructure could result in lowerthanexpected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations this may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term contributing to further volatility

2024-12-31,17:46:30,investing,AAPL,Apple,money market fund verses high yield savings account as the title suggests i am looking at the differences between hysa and a money market for storing my savings i recently acquired 5500 from selling one of my cars and want to put that in savings but logistically what is the most practical option in case i need to pull out the money in the event of emergencies or whatever the case maybe if i need access to the funds quick i do have a schwab account and the ability to get a hysa via my apple card or if there are other alternatives i am open to them thanks
2024-12-31,17:30:46,investing,AAPL,Apple,dca into spy by selling puts 250k never traded options before hi guys i will try to give context to my whole situation while also keeping it brief after all income minus expenses mortgage other i have a surplus of about 23k a month that i just collect in my bank for the past few years it was just rotting in my boa account but recently i moved it to robinhood so it atleast gets 4 now a few years ago i put 50k in gte sold it when it hit 65k had to pay taxes on the 15k then put the 65k into sdc dcad when stock fell in half and put in another 50k sdc went bankrupt so i lost 115k would be nice if i could tax harvest it some how also this whole time i was not putting any money into 401k or roth a month ago filled up my roth for the robinhood bonus and will deposit another 7k in a few days and a few days ago i finally went to my hr portal and enabled max 401k why it took me this long i dont know anyways i already made every possible financial mistake so i was just trying to make the final biggest one of all timing the market that is why i let my savings balloon to 250k even after the sdc loss but i just read somewhere that selling puts of spy is like dcaing plus you also get paid a premium as you can see i am very financially illiterate ive never traded options before although i do have a robinhood account and im smart enough to know how to have a good job that pay wells can someone help me walk through this i understand that when i enter a contract to sell puts i buy 100 shares of that stock at the current price if the shares go up i am mandated to sell these shares at that price i bought them and the buyer can take those shares and instantly sell them for the higher price if the stock goes down however than my option expires worthless but i dont care because i was hoping for that to happen if my goal was to dca into spy i already bought the 100 shares i just got paid the premium for giving someone an option to speculate on them i have a couple of questions first when doing this option is there a particularly security to choose like spy or voo or splg or just the stocks i want to invest in like microsoft apple amazon google for example i noticed spy has a ton of dates for selling puts whereas splg only has 5 possible dates roughly 23 months apart my goal is to maximize bid price right the lower you try to sell the put for usually the lower the bid price also if i try to sell a put that expires in a few days usually the bid price is a few dollars a month away it goes up to 10 but two months away it doesnt double to 20 it goes to around 1214 so that is why the most optimal puts are to buy the ones that are a month away because you collect the premium and can choose to invest into selling more puts again more quickly if stock went up should i try to care about limit order or market order right now im looking at spy the current price is 58870 and there is a put for 588 on feb 21st with a bid price of 1021 so irregardless i make 1021 if stock goes down i was planning to dca into spy so now i own 100 shares if stock goes up someone else makes more money since i have 250k i can do this trade 4 times and at the end of february i either have 250k plus 4k or i have 400 shares of spy i guess now the question becomes how do i maximize the bid price while not doing something crazy what is the best strategy for this plus i kinda do still believe in timing the market a little i feel like there might be a sharp drop around end of jan trump and then we will probably trend downwards or sideways for a year or so im curious if you guys agree or disagree or what are your market predictions i feel like recession sentiment is growing but i dont know how that correlates to an actual recession

2024-12-28,17:02:12,investing,AAPL,Apple,the new normal in asset valuation with a slight delay i finally watched the big short highly recommend itexcellent movie it got me thinking about how much the world has changed in the past 15 years the 20072008 crisis was all about financiers selling bad products as good onesuntil reality broke through the glitter and the bubble burst the protagonist of the film bet against the system as soon as he realized the product was fundamentally flawed and he relatively easily waited for the explosion to occur truth prevailed quickly now things are completely different weve been living in a wellknown yet unpopped bubble for years take apple for instance its objectively a very good company i like their products i buy the new iphone and airpods and i even own some of their shares im by no means saying its a bad investment but lets examine it the way burry and his colleagues looked at bondsasking whats really behind that aaa rating its much easier for us now than it was for them for our investigation theres no need to talk to exotic dancers or drive through dusty backwaters everything is right there in the public reports the most basic figures clear as day show that todays apple is not a stock of future growth its a classic cash cow stable profitable but not growing adjusted for inflation its actually a shrinking business net profit 100 billion a year nearly all of it with some extra is distributed as dividends and buybacks the company hasnt released a genuinely successful new product in 10 years antitrust regulators arent fond of it theres no sign of explosive growth ahead but the risk of a sharp decline exists whats such a business objectively worth strictly less than a riskfree us treasury bond yielding 100 billion in coupons annually how much less you could write two volumes debating how to assess business risks but its lessrisk compared to no risk at the same yield yes us treasuries have risk too but if the dollar collapses the government would likely tax apple into oblivion first the 30year bond we need costs 22 trillion today apple 34 trillion thats an extra trillion right there a trillion carl the hole in 2007 was larger but even then a trillion wouldve been noticeable in the context of the entire crisis and here i picked just one company almost at random and its a good company everyone sees this all the numbers are public i havent discovered america here tons of independent analysts and experts predict a global crash based on similar logicexactly like burry once did many people believe them year after year short the market and lose money doing it meanwhile the market keeps climbing and whether it will actually collapse someday nobody knows for now everythings steadily growing the pandemic records have long been surpassed this isnt 2007 reality no longer breaks through the glitter

2024-12-23,17:12:33,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA,when tech eventually fizzles will us continue to dominate backtesting excluding tech vs global markets edit people are misunderstanding the question im not bearish on tech its more of a question of us continuing to out perform the global market once the expected returns on tech slows tldr as techs strong performance fades maybe it doesnt but eventually it might why should we believe the us market will continue to outperform globally has anyone already backtested the sp 500 excluding techespecially the magnificent 7and compared its performance to developed and emerging markets over the past 15 years the us market has massively outperformed global equities leading to the narrative that us governance monetary policy the strength of the dollar as the global reserve currency and favorable geopolitical conditions will continue to support this dominance this view is widely accepted in this community you can find tons of discussions on this by searching international here if you havent already however the primary driver of us outperformance has been the tech sector particularly the magnificent 7 apple microsoft nvidia google amazon tesla and meta a quick search shows that these companies have been responsible for a significant portion of us market returns over the past two decades with tech alone contributing heavily to the growth of the sp 500 but what happens when the tech sector eventually hits a slowdown or correction while it could continue to dominate for another decade at some point the market may shift and another sector or region could rise to prominence so if tech especially the magnificent 7 loses its edge what is left to support us market dominance im particularly interested in whether anyone has backtested the sp 500 excluding tech stocks especially the mag 7 and compared its performance against global marketsboth developed and emerging excluding the top tech names from the sp 500 could provide a more realistic view of the underlying market performance without the distortion caused by these megacap stocks which are arguably overvalued or at least priced for significant future growth im asking this because as a longterm passive investor i think the mag 7 may be overvalued and their strong returns over the past 15 years might not be sustainable to further diversify my portfolio ive begun investing in us mid and smallcap sp funds but im also looking to increase my exposure to global equities from what i can see excluding tech from the equation international equities dont appear to underperform as much relative to us stocks so im interested in seeing if global diversification especially in emerging markets would still yield solid returns after this adjustment a few questions i have has anyone conducted a backtest or analysis of the sp 500s performance excluding the magnificent 7 how does it compare to global markets particularly developed and emerging markets if tech returns eventually fizzle out or at least grow more slowly should we expect the us to continue outperforming what other sectors or factors might drive us market growth in the future ive prepared myself for critical feedbackdrag me

2024-12-21,19:43:32,investing,AAPL,Apple,is there a point in investing in emerging markets many people invest in emerging markets with the rationale that these countries have a huge growth potential but my rationale says that even if these economies grow its the companies from the developed world that will benefit the most for example as poor countries gain more disposable incomes theyll be able to buy more expensive products like iphones and macbooks so this will help the apple stock grow not the stock of some company in these emerging economies thats not to say those companies wont grow at all sure they will with increased internal demand but the developed world has more to gain from the growth of the emerging economies also most internal growth will come from international companies opening their manufacturing plants in emerging economies like apple and samsung manufacturing in india so again it only makes sense to invest in developed world what do you guys think

2024-12-17,22:22:09,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA,first time beating the sp500 in 3 years also reached my second goal of half a milli i started investing in november 2017 and i was doing great during the bull run unfortunately everything crashed down in 2021 and i spent 3 years kicking myself thinking i shouldve just put everything on spy and forget it in the last few months i can finally say that my portfolio is beating the index again at some point during december 2022 my portfolio was 35 while in comparison if i had put it on spy i would still be positive this traumatized me a bit and now that i am finally beating the index over the last 72 years i have three main thoughts 1 is the volatility worth it 2 im up on some names anything from 200800 which makes them seem overvalued and makes me hesitate on buying more of those companies 3 feels like a 30 haircut can happen at any moment and im just dreading when it comes summary portfolio is up 193 since inception nov 2017 sitting at 595k breakdown tsla 45 pltr 25 btc 17 clpt 6 abcl 3 rest less than 5 beam clsk nvda amd meta i think for now im going to either lower my average on the few names im still down or just slightly up and believe strongly like beam or meta or just buy spy and turn that into tsla btc or pltr only if there is a big correction in those names btw my strategy is mainly buying and holding ive only sold a few companies over the years let me know your thoughts

2024-12-17,01:24:17,investing,TSLA,Tesla,ponzi spotting a laymens guide to differentiating investments from ponzi schemes i often see things being called ponzi schemes on reddit that are very much not ponzi schemes usually it always stems from the criticism that a particular investment only goes up in price because someone newer is paying a higher price for it hence it must be a ponzi im going to blow your minds a little bit almost all legitimate investments require new investors willing to pay a higher price for older investors to cash out a profit most investable objects regardless of what underlies the object trade at a price on a market this means at the margin some percentage usually only a small percentage of the total available supply of the object is trading hands the trade is priced typically in your local fiat currency but this does not necessarily have to be the case prices are determined by supply and demand when an investable object goes up in price on a market it means there were no sellers of the object at the lower price and price goes up until the next marginal seller decides they are willing to part with that object at the higher price the use of the term investable object is intentionally left extremely broad it essentially means anything quantifiable that can be owned and traded this includes contracts stocks bonds physical objects digital objects etc example 1 you bought a 1st edition charizard for 20 dollars when it came out in the 1990s since it was relatively abundant still being printed by the company and pokemon was relatively new at the time the supply was high and the demand was low fast forward 30 years pokemon is super popular and there are very few 1st edition charizards remaining out of print for decades many were lost or destroyed through the years you now are able to sell the charizard for 10000 dollars to a guy that just got into pokemon card collecting congratulations you bought low and sold high was what you participated in a ponzi scheme because you an old investor made a profit by selling to a new investor i really hope your answer to this is no if you think the answer is yes you can stop reading here because i dont think anything im going to say beyond this point is going to help you the next step in logic is realizing this charizard example is essentially how all investment returns are made when the investable object at hand is not providing a direct flow of cash this is true for nondividend which is the vast majority stocks derivatives physical collectibles like pet rocksbeanie babiestulip bulbs and digital collectibles like ingame skinsnftscryptocurrencies etc examples of cash flowing investments would be dividend stocks direct ownership of small businesses such that net profits are available to you or rental properties it is important to note while ultimately supply and demand determine if a price for an investable object goes up over time the underlying reason an investable object has demand at all can be wildly different from object to object the reason some people want first edition charizards is usually a very different reason people want to own a stock of a company it is within the eye of the investor to decide if the reason is a good reason and hopefully a reason that leads to increased demand in the future so what is a ponzi according to chatgpt a ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment scam that promises high returns with little or no risk to investors the scheme relies on using the funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors rather than generating legitimate profit from actual investments or business activities eventually the scheme collapses when it becomes impossible to recruit enough new investors or when too many existing investors try to withdraw their money at the same time that seems like a pretty good definition to me the part that everyone focuses on when thinking about a ponzi is this part the scheme relies on using funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors this sounds extremely similar to my charizard example yet i hope you have the intellectual honesty to accept that a real ponzi scheme is different from buying low and selling high the part that is extremely important in addition to old investor returns being funded by new investors is that the scheme promises a return the reality is that many ponzi schemes do not start off as ponzi schemes there are sometimes investment funds that partake briefly in ponzilike behavior to paper over potential insolvency during a downturn and then return to legitimate investment activities when the market improves doing this is quite risky and is still illegal because if you arent able to essentially over deliver and underpromise on future returns to even things out youre essentially stuck in an endless cycle of repaying old investors who cash out with newer investor money turning your once legitimate investment fund into a ponzi scheme the right move is to always be open and honest about what returns youre able to achieve for your investors to avoid being stuck in the ponziloop i described another attribute of ponzi schemes is that ponzis almost always violently collapse once the perceived value of the fund goes down this is because once a ponzi stops attracting new money it becomes apparent very quickly that the liabilities of the fund far outstrip the assets example 2 imagine a hypothetical ponzi scheme the ponzi fund initially accepted 1000 dollars from 10 eager investors in a local town the fund manager promises a 10 annual yield so that in 1 years time any of the original investors can withdraw 1100 if they so please unfortunately our manager really sucks at operating this ponzi and after 1 year obtains exactly zero new clients his liabilities at the end of the year are now 11000 but he only has 10000 of cash on hand even more unfortunately for him taylor swift is announced to be coming to town and tickets are on sale now and the tickets incidentally cost 1100 all his investors want to cash out immediately so they ask for their money back the first 9 that come to him are able to get their money back 1100 x 9 9900 when the 10th person comes back he realizes theres only 100 for him not the 1100 he was promised the fund not only has basically no money left it owes 1000 the 10th person notifies the police and our unfortunate fund manager is arrested for fraud i will note that in this example this scheme required 90 of the investors to withdraw for the scheme to collapse but examples in history tend to be much more skewed where even a small withdrawal of 15 of investors can completely collapse the scheme returning to the investable object definition once a ponzi runs out of new investors to pay prior investors the investable object completely disappears because the fund you thought was flush with desirable investable objects that could be sold on an open market for hopefully higher than you originally paid for actually had a negative cash balance the entire time behind the curtain there actually was no object at all this is in contrast to our buy low sell high example with the charizard card the charizard market could hypothetically collapse tomorrow such that the market price drops from 10000 to 1 maybe everyone collectively realizes pokemon is super lame and that yugioh is the superior card game at the end of the day there are two truths you still own the investable object aka the charizard and no one promised you a return for owning it you can always wait it out hoping that people become interested in charizards and pokemon again i hope this somewhat lengthy piece was helpful in elucidating ponzi schemes for anyone that read this far i often see clearly nonponzi investable objects being echochambered as ponzis on reddit when it really stems from a misunderstanding of the investable object or the mechanics of investment itself if your investable object trades on an open market and nominal gains are made through price increases due to supply and demand dynamics it is almost certainly not a ponzi if nobody is promising you a return it also probably isnt a ponzi this does not mean your investable object itself is not a scam or a bubble that determination should be made with your best judgment of the fundamentals that underlie the object itself i will leave you with 2 final examples to illustrate this example 3 tesla stock is neither a ponzi trades on open market nor a scam they actually sell cars batteries etc for a profit it might be a bubble if you think the companys market cap is too high for what its future profits will be example 4 nikola stock is not a ponzi stock traded on open market but it was a scam the ceo lied to investors about how functional the cars were they werent and how many they sold pretty much zero
2024-12-16,21:02:39,investing,TSLA,Tesla,reminder if you trade more wall street makes more money ive spent a few years reading warren buffett and other value investors essentially what i learned is that they make money by other people pushing prices too high or too low especially when prices become too low they swoop in and buy a bunch next they sit on it a few years until the price goes to the correct valuation again or preferably after many years when the company deteriorates time and time again people have predicted that buffetts strategy will eventually stop working we nowadays can learn much more etc etc yet stock prices are all over the place tesla doubled in the last 3 months for example how is that possible how can a 1t dollar company double in value in 3 months they still build the same stuff with roughly the same people similar for bitcoin also almost doubled in a few months if that was inevitable according to some metric then why was it not priced in at the same time there is a common sentiment online that the world is becoming more and more unequal more wealth accumulates in the hands of a few people so let me say this if you are currently considering buying into some stock that went up recently please let me remind you that there is only one party that will always make money from your trade its not you its your brokerwall street they dont care whether you make money or lose money some will slam price targets on stocks if that makes you trade some will call other stocks uninvestible if that makes you trade
2024-12-16,20:27:44,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA,achieved my first milestone after 3 years after 3 years of investing ive finally achieved my goal of investing my first 100000 this was a challenge i gave myself after hearing warren buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market i know that by now its inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k but thats my next goal i did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent finding a decent job that pays 75k80k a year avoiding fast food where possible and just being frugal in general investment strategy 1 investing 10 every business day into both voo and voog roughly 400 a month 2 investing in tesla when tesla is low this is 20 of my portfolio my largest position 3 keeping my ear to the ground and capitalizing on things like metas stock devaluing though i totally missed nvidia sadly 4 diversifying into other promising tech companies such as microsoft and google less than fruitful but its still diversified i think the riskiest strategy has been in tesla in the past its been difficult watching the stock go up and down but i had faith in their business practices and ethics now tesla is popping off and given elons position with trump this should give room for tesla to continue its growth sadly because of that i cant view tesla as much as an ethical company as much as i could in the past but that wont diminish its ability to grow and i see the stock continuing to rise in the future looking forward since tesla isnt going to be low for some time one thing i want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies such as nuclear for ai companies so ill continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to any recommendations are welcome my next goal will be to reach 300000 invested by the end of 2026 what do you all think achievable

bets but some of the increasingly high pe ratios concerned me pltr tsla etc so i sold them and purchased more nvidia this approach is considered risky but i have strong conviction in their relative valuation defensibility and longterm prospects in this case i believe that diversification among ai stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks particularly because theyre all highly correlated and despite its market cap nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered well see if the bet pays off to clarify i am confident in the longterm prospects of palantir tesla and others but im just not comfortable with the valuations i may reassess in the future when i have new information or valuations change meta is the only other stock i held onto given my bullish view on their ai and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation unrealized current investments meta meta 36797 nvidia nvda 11705 nvidias performance here is understated since i recently increased my holdings but its up 200 since i initially purchased it last year after dithering for months these returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights but id like to maintain some anonymity around it rate of return irr my annual return irr for this portfolio jun 2022 to dec 2024 is 736 investment thesis see a summary of my investment thesis in a previous update tldr ai is another secular trend like pcs windows mac the internet browsers search social and mobile ios android wearables the difference is that new technology like ai can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past potentially bending the growth curve in new ways the other difference is that nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation therefore the 350 run up over the last 12 months doesnt make nvidia the stock of the last year but rather its the stock of the next decade the recent 3x gain will be a blip compared to whats coming thanks to nvidias cuda moat among other things 15 year followup on buying the dip on pandemic stocks nov 2023 nvidias dominance im still working through my thoughts here but my strong conviction around nvidia comes in part from these observations nvidia is founderled and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies its unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fastgrowing valuable industry while maintaining such a longterm sustainable advantage this advantage is due to unreasonable investments research hardware software ecosystem relationships over decades making it hard to copy ai will consistently make software easier to create thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies for now despite their impressive growth nvidia is still supply constrained which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints we still underestimate the ai opportunity most importantly weve barely scratched the surface of ais opportunities and benefits even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper ai gets the more use cases well find we have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality our imaginations are trained on what happened before but there has never been anything like this before final thoughts im still well within the maybe im just lucky phase since its only been a couple years towards the end of my last update i also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed which im still benefiting from i expect my next update to be the 3year update in mid 2025 update thanks for mentioning i should have included indexes for benchmark context indexes like qqq and sp 500 also had good returns during the same period june 2022 dec 2024 for an apples to apples comparison the irr of qqq and sp 500 respectively during this period were 24 and 16

2024-12-12,22:05:32,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA,nvda fundamental analysis w charts there is no shortage of dollars or bullshit when it comes to nvda the worlds ai gpu hero of heroes and with nvdas revenue and profits not just increasing but multiplying in such a short timespan investors want to know is it still a good time to buy to catch the ai wave as it builds and crashes upon the world both that of capital investment and the greater world at large revenue and profits multiplying and heres the chart that shows the impact of chatgpt on the share price and earnings the top line is the price investors are paying the bottom line is what those investors are getting so to speak nvdas net income over the previous year trailing twelve months the vertical line roughly represents chatgpt hitting 100m users with the line at 2023 january 1st and chatgpt reportedely hitting 100m users sometime in that month of january according to reuters and the guardian reuters the guardian the firm will present you with the basic facts about nvda not as and never as a financial recommendation but as an introduction to its financials to give you a better idea if its even worth your time to further explore nvda as a company and potential vehicle of investment the firm does not want you to be falsely misled into thinking we can offer you expertise on nvda we cannot we can however answer the questions that we would expect any man whod risk his capital to answer how much money does nvda make how much do they have and you would think most importantly how much has nvda paid their previous investors so far and while we dont believe the answers to these questions to justify investment this firm adamantly believes that not knowing the answers to these questions is unacceptable for those who do or would choose to buy common stock in nvda in short youd have to be a fucking idiot to lend your money to a company without reading our charts and commentary or the equivalent there of to assess the full risk of nvda however will require a much deeper dive than a single blog post can provide lets take a look at what investors were thinking during the chatgpt hype and whether that investment panned out at a fundamental rather than speculative level in other words did nvda actually make more money or did its share price just go up this graph shows what percentage of nvdas share price was being represented by the money it had made ttm net incomesharesshare price this 10 year low during 2023 shows unequivically that there was in fact investment hype during this time that the price per earnings went very high as people were willing to accept less than 1 earnings just to get in on the hype why would investors accept such low earnings per dollar because these investors anticipated that the rapid adoption of chatgpt and the ai hype around it would mean a growth for nvda that would more than make up for the price they paid so were they dumb did they overpay lets find out for our example well imagine an investor that bought sometime in february after the 100m user threshold was announced february 15th 2023 2275 price 0175 net income 01752275 08 december 10th 2024 257 net income 2572217 11 if an investor had bought sometime in february after the news of the 100m users was released lets say for example february 15th at a closing price of approximately 2275 per share they would have bought when nvdas trailing twelve month net income was about 0175 175 cents per share or about 08 of the price of the share at that time today those same shares carry about 257 per share a wopping 10x increase almost 15 actually in just 2 years 2572275 11 which means investors that bought in on the ai hype are already seeing the net income of their shares exceed the growth rate of the money supply m2 which is about 78 meaning that nvda isnt just earning more dollars its earning a greater share of the economic pie and in a world where profits are actually returned to investors would mean beating inflation at least from a micro perspective now whether this cash that nvda is reporting to generate will ever actually make it back to the shareholder is another story now that weve seen that buying even when the fundamental value of the shares was at its lowest has paid off lets take a look at how much money nvda actually has as you can see nvda has almost no money relative to its price the markets pricing of nvda is derived principally from the money it is supposed to make in the future rather than the present value of the company this is not what the firm would deem a good fundamental investment why because one would be paying a future price for future value rather than the current price for its current value furthermore the market is a game of desperation and if shareholders are desperate for money they should be offering their shares below the liquidation value of the company a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush after all however if one understands that nvdas price has been based on the growth of its earnings and if one can also see that the growth of said earnings has gone up but its stock price has gone down as is the case for nvda at the time of this post 135 then one could speculate that the market will not only price nvdas earnings higher than they are currently being priced but that the market will actually price its earnings higher than in the previous quarters unless the market believes that nvdas future growth will be lower the firm believes that within the next 3 months nvda will almost certainly attain new all time highs in fact we believe the passive participant in the market will be genuinely surprised by how high the price of nvda will go at the time of this post the firm has no positions in nvda an associate of the firm has exposure to nvda through long options on the snp500 a position the firm feels is not worth mentioning as longing the snp500 might as well be a long on inflation so nvda has made all this money how much of that money has been returned to shareholders as you can see by that line at the bottom almost none about half of the money has been spent on share buybacks and when the companys evaluation is 50x the money that it makes and 50x the money that it has these buybacks only break even once the company has actually grown 50x less so if youre only evaluating the company on past earnings and not the amount of money it actually has in this case you might only want a 5x to consider yourself breaking even id much rather have my money now and use it to make more money than wait around for nvda to 50x but nvda doesnt give shareholders the option of how to spend their own money or how to evaluate the company they dont give the money to the shareholder to decide whether they want to wait for a 50x gain on nvda theyve decided theyll spend it for you not on growing the company or acquiring others but by buying their own stock now that we can understand a basic view of nvdas finances and how it relates to its price lets take a glance at some of the more sinister aspects of nvda first is this little tidbit the firm discovered while reading nvdas q2 filing nvda expects you to follow all 6 of its listed social media accounts and will be leaving out material information in its 10q and 10k filings that will only be available in its listed social media accounts this is clearly unethical and our firm at this time questions whether this intent to distribute exclusive material information across 6 different channels is even legal though we do not have the legal training or background to make a claim one way or the other we would like to assume that the system in place would not allow such a thing now lets throw a bone to the hardware guys if youve never heard of moores law you can skip this section as trying to understand what moores law means will get in the way of seeing the blatant contradiction between nvdas ceo and his companys own sec filings for your time moores law is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years the observation is named after gordon moore the cofounder of fairchild semiconductor and intel from wikipedia so why is the firm bringing up moores law we dont even know what half that sentence means and we certainly wouldnt be able to explain the nuances of nvdas hardware products well theres one thing we do know its how to bullshit so lets wind back the clocks to the end of 2022 september right before entering q4 moores laws dead huang said and the ability for moores law to deliver twice the performance at the same cost or at the same performance half the cost every year and a half is over its completely over and so the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time unfortunately is a story of the past source ok so going into q4 moores law is dead the ceo said its over baby rapid growth is a thing of the past that means the market should be lowering its growth expectations for nvda right but it did the opposite investors were willing to pay more for less implying they actually expected nvdas long term growth rate to increase not decrease almost as if the market knew what nvda would end up publishing in its q4 filing source 10k filed feb 24 2023 so not only did the company contradict the ceos statements made in the september prior to the reported quarter now theyre actually ahead of moores law and according to them giving the entire industry a path forward what the fuck and to finish things off well put on our tin foil hats the firm does not know how to verify the veracity of the following information there has been a short report put out by hindenburg research regarding smci the firm has no idea if the information reported is true so this last section is just for fun if the information in the report is true then the firm would conclude that it paints the picture that smci has been funneling money out of the company into other companies out of shareholder hands into the hands of insiders and their network of family and friends smcis biggest customer nvda in other words if the allegations are accurate the biggest chunk of money that smci funneled out came from nvda so its really not outside the realm of possibility that nvda was intentionally buying from smci knowing where the money was ending up the firm is not in the practice of lawsuits or building criminal cases so the firm cannot and has no intention of doing so here for you now the firm however is also not stupid and the fact that all this money the company is making is not ending up in shareholders pockets really isnt helping the management would never steal from shareholders fantasy that many would like to be the truism that must be disproved with mountains of evidence it should have to be proven that the money is being returned to investors not the other way around when the vast majority of the profits dont go to the investors which we can see from the dividend chart but get spent on buybacks at 50x multiples well people start to listen when accusations start to be made about money being funneled into other companies weve learned a lot weve seen the impressive growth of nvdas earnings and how they relate to its price and the general hype around ai weve shown that the company has barely any money at all and is being priced on future earnings weve shown where some of this money is going and we even got to put on our conspiracy hats for a little bit and that is our fundamental analysis of nvda the ai giant the good the bad and the fugly thanks for tuning in
2024-12-12,18:51:03,investing,TSLA,Tesla,returning to active stock portfolio management i recently decided to return to active stock portfolio management after my first attempt ended somewhat disastrously to reconcile this experience and entertain others i want to reflect on the mistakes i made and the new approaches ive adopted but first briefly the story of my initial failure when i started managing my portfolio i quickly learned about the sp 500 but was convinced i was smart enough to outperform the market arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall in 2019 i flirted with bitcoin which initially delivered great returns encouraged by the hype i also invested heavily in paysafe shortly after its ipo believing in its potential because everyone said it was going to be great at the same time i was doing a lot of day trading looking back i realize i wasnt trading rationally id look at graphs and invest simply because i felt the price would go up i was taking desirable outcomes for granted although i made a few conservative and reasonable investments their success couldnt offset the losses caused by bitcoins decline paysafes terrible performance and my risky trading after 18 months my portfolio was down 40 the arrogance i started with made the loss feel devastating i abandoned my investment account for several years when i returned to it a year ago i discovered that the growth of my conservative investments along with bitcoins recovery had boosted my portfolio to 20 growth from my initial investment i sold everything and bought into the sp 500 feeling that i wasnt capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund this turned out to be a good action as the sp 500 performed very well this year now i feel ive learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again to avoid repeating the same mistakes ive set specific rules to guide me 1 i avoid speculative investments i now steer clear of speculative assets like crypto ipo stocks or companies like tesla i want to be a disciplined investor keeping my greed under control 2 i reject market timing i no longer believe in timing the market but instead focus on time in the market i avoid trying to buy low today and sell high tomorrow because its too easy to confuse wishful thinking with reality paying attention to micro events can help to take advantage of daily fluctuations but it requires too much time and still offers uncertain outcomes more often than not it doesnt pay off 3 focus on debttoequity in the past i ignored the debttoequity ratio now i prioritize companies with consistent net income and manageable debt levels 4 limit individual stock exposure i cap my individual stock picks at 5 of my total portfolio previously this rule would have forced me to find 20 or more stocks to invest in leading to choosing assets that were just okay rather than ones i genuinely liked thankfully with most of my portfolio now in the sp 500 individual stock picks act as a good supplement rather than a replacement for the index 5 invest in goods and services i value my approach to stock selection has shifted i now look for companies whose products and services i personally interact with and consider them of great value if the companies also demonstrate strong financial performance and maintain a reasonable debttoequity ratio they become my choice i hope these rules will help me sleep well at night keep me from obsessing over financial news and generate decent returns that complement the sp 500
2024-12-12,15:53:59,investing,TSLA,Tesla,research is the key to your success i dont understand how people can put their hard earned money into a stock based on posts that promise epic gains just hit the buy button and do more research research has to be done methodically so you dont waste your time learning about junk know what drives the ceo is it greed prestige or just a passion for tackling the problems that are extremely difficult and nobody else wants to put in the resources and time required im not disclosing my research strategy because im doing it all day every day even when im in no position to make a move i still look for opportunities jensen huang and palantir have two of the best ceos in the market and elon is right there as well as he tries to populate the world and make it better for all of us he is an enigma to me and i have lost the two times i had tesla stock they were both gambles and i decided to be a contrarian and got smoked everything you need is in your hands ask chat gpt for a checklist of the risks and metrics you should always consider before investing in any company for the love of god put your work in you dont know if that post is legit or driving a narrative

2024-12-11,13:43:05,investing,AAPL,Apple,is a trillion dollar valuation possible for spotify in all the investing subs i am surprised that more people are not mentioning spotifys 2030 ambition in 2022 they presented their target for 100 billion in revenue by 2030 they claim they are ahead on their plans so far at 4 billion euros in revenue last quarter they obviously have a ways to go but surprisingly ads made up just 472 million of their revenue while subscribers made up just over 35 billion whats more they have 25x as many ad supported users as premium subscribers meaning they have a ton of room for improving ad revenue i imagine they are planning on ad revenue growing rapidly in the next 6 years it seems they could easily double revenue without adding any new users just by growing ad revenue i know its very speculative but what is their potential market cap in 2030 if they hit their target is it possible that they get above 1 trillion one day or is this overly ambitions given the market they are in fwiw they have youtube in their cross hairs i have been seeing more and more songs that have the video option and only within the last week i saw that super simple songs recently added a video to their latest song they are of baby shark fame and one of the biggest creators on youtube with podcasts having video and being able to easily monetize that with targeted ads from spotify it seems that the line between spotify and youtube is becoming blurred it seems to me like spotify is a good long term play and can be anywhere from 5x to 10x 6 years from now the biggest risk is competition but apple music is really just for apple users and even then apple users seem to prefer spotify globally it seems like there is a lot of room for consolidation for example siri is really just usa and other countries also have their own audio apps but globally spotify seems to be the clear winner and i would imagine that consolidation happens what are your thoughts is spotify a good long term investment edit also ai is a huge risk ive been using suno and it is pretty great but spotify is also known as a leading tech company google agile the spotify way many european companies are trying to emulate their approach to the agile process meaning that i also have some faith in their ability to innovate and execute on the software end edit 2 luckily with stocks we can put our money where our mouth is i think theyll 5x10x in 6 years also the projected global ad revenue is projected to reach 1 trillion in 2030 due to ai i see google search ad revenue decreasing in addition to premium subscribers there is an absolutely massive opportunity in ad revenue which they have yet to tap into

2024-12-08,13:47:50,investing,TSLA,Tesla,im bullish on rivian and here is why currently holding 65 shares looking to round that out to 100 next pay period i am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice i am simply sharing my thoughts these are the things i will be watching this year to continue to add to my position or to see if i should reconsider my bullish sentiment 1 nearing profitability rivian has recently reaffirmed that by q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle they are expected to deliver just over 50000 vehicles for the year that is a combination of mostly r1s and r1t with some of the amazon delivery vans if there guidance is correct and they either meet or beat q4 24 earnings it is a bullish sign 2 6 billion loan from uncle sam now the new administration does create a bit of tension here the new doge agency is going to be cutting gov spending across the board there is some concern they will take away this loan that the biden administration had given to rivian while this is certainly a possibility i do not think it is going to happen i think it would be a very bad look politically and would give strength to the argument musk will us his gov connections to attack his competitors because of that i think this money is safely staying with rivian if it turns out doge is going to back down from this threat that is another bullish sign 3 vw rivian joint venture vw na is about to change they are getting a new ceo kjell gruner who previously was the president and ceo of porsche cars of north america and then moved to rivian to be there chief commercial officer president business growth vw desperatley needs software expertise and rivian delivers that in spades that combined with vws massive buying and production power is a strong match this is a bullish sign right now and what i think has been pushing to stock upwards vw has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits the introduction of the oldnew scout brand that looks mighty similar to rivians r2 concepts as well as confirming the deal with rivian it looks like theyre finally going to start to take serious steps to rebuilding their reputation especially in na 4 rivians customers are happy and according to a recent consumer reports survey 86 of owners say they would buy a rivian again better than tesla if they are happy with their purchase they will talk to their other wealthy friends about their rivian word of mouth is very powerful 5 the inevitable tesla comparison rivian is not tesla now obviously tesla the company in 2024 is very different to tesla the company in 2015 back in 2015 it was the 3rd year of model s production and the first of model x in 2015 tesla sold just over 50000 model s now in 2023 just two years after the rivian r1t debuted rivian sold just over 47000 vehicles i think tesla in 2015 is more of a fair comparison to rivian now in 2024 but tesla now in 2024 is not so comparable to rivian now in 2024 i think rivian makes a fantastic product and theres a bright future ahead for them
2024-12-07,01:10:51,investing,AAPL,Apple,covid as a mini lost decade by overlaying earnings and market cap we can get a pretty rough story of what happened with covid and money printing and interest rate hikes and what this means for the future this image below is a bunch of large companies that represent the spy the colored areas are their earnings with their predicted earnings in a lighter shade and the black line is their combined market cap price ive annotated a few arrows to explain what seems to have roughly happened orange arrow 2020 2022 interest rates drop which causes excess liquidity to flood the market those who already had assets saw huge portfolio increases this new wealth combined with low interest caused a housing price boom new money in the hands of retail caused cults to form around memes like gme plus no one wants to work and is wfh red arrow 2022 a lost decade is a period of time where new investors have no access to good investments people who just started working in 2022 or decided to start investing in 2022 had no good place to put their money and would only have broken even in 2024 the horizontal dash in a larger crisis like with japans lost decades you have 1020 years where the stock market effectively grinds sideways red orange if you overlay the spy with the feds interest rate policy you can see that it looks to have caused some temporary price distress but long term the price is correlated with earnings not interest rate a lost decade is effectively exuberance that pulls forward price appreciation and steals it from future investors in the covid response those who had assets in 2020 benefited while those who started investing in 2022 had a difficult time bc they didnt have access to the exponential growth of markets blue line long term investors who think in decades and dont actually need large purchases like cars or weddings like old people can just ignore these bumps and focus on long term earnings the above is obviously oversimplified but its an example of how using earnings and price in tandem allows you to see the underlying story behind price movement if you just focus on price all you can do is draw a line up and the right and say things that are true like aapl is a good company you have no perspective the worst example is someone who got scared of investing in stocks in 2020 but seeing everyone around him get rich for 2 years he decides to start investing in 2022 and loses money for two years and decides to stop and then starts watching everyone around him make more money in a neverending spiral of 2 year delayed fomo its like relying on a tourist pamphlet in a foreign city if you cant make a judgement of quality independently then you will always pay high prices and wait in long lines

2024-12-06,17:54:17,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA,what would you consider a good entry point for bitcoin bitcoin recently hit a value of 100k as im sure we are all aware by now arguably bitcoin has been one of the most successful investments over the last 10 years up there with nvda and other mag 7 stocks i wont lie ive been a bitcoin hater for most of my investing career its tough to conceptualize fully it has not always been mainstream enough so its understandable to be learn of it and its supports are so ardent and ravenous that it feels like a cult i dont blame any skeptics for not putting their money into it that said over the last year or two it has certainly gained a ton of legitimacy as it has played a significant role in trumps presidential campaign and also begun to be an asset that hedge funds are also purchasing i like many others i assume want to make it a part of my portfolio but its tough to analyze its value because it doesnt act like your usually security exchanged on the stock market there are no balance sheets or income statements for bitcoin to look at and i have no idea if its valuation is way too high or too low i can certainly see it continuing to go up in the near to mid term future if you told me it would hit 200k in the next two years i wouldnt be surprised that said i also wouldnt be surprised if it also hit 40k in the next two years too is now a good time to buy theres a lot of hype around it after it just hit 100k in value so im nervous about jumping into it right now but im struggling to put together a fair value estimate that i should wait for it to hit before i buy what are your thoughts on this matter

2024-12-03,19:58:35,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA,investing question diversification for diversifications sake i have a very overweight portfolio if you can even call it a portfolio seems silly considering i only own 3 different stocks and it consists of 95 meta stocks have held them since 2018 bought 1st in 2016 and then again in 2018 also have a little nvda and just bought a few shares of schd its generally pretty risky to be so heavily invested in just one stock but its up 75 ytd was supposed to go see a guy today an advisor who my cousin has worked with for a decade but he cancelled rescheduled for next friday dunno what i am asking for specifically just some advice on whether i am overthinking this about whether i should diversify a little

2024-12-01,11:04:38,investing,TSLA,Tesla,a second or third revisit of why warren buffet may not have fully understood tsla when he said value is equivalent to the whole car industry hi investment friends starting with the point of this analysis tesla is a wrigleys or a coca cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential warren buffetts although we love him hes one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto invest in things you understand it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz most are very much understandable or its just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as i call his favorites assets like gum candy airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers but theres still that constant that hes not infallible what it means to understand has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before as most have said in the tech industry sir warrens fundamental which includes that its highly speculative also its not on the record but it implies hes not into elon musks kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but thats another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads tesla analysis of tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz its most likely incomplete as most have said tesla is not just a car company its not just a products company selling cars what was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized an example is ev cars that are practical compared to evs from generations past now you have the many models of tesla elon musk w tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative although i dont agree with him 100 especially when it comes to 100 autonomy coz technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology tesla is not just a car company its more than that its an energy company generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ate its own cake too as they say it creates the products the batteries to facilities that energy charging service its an ai company solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given tesla w elons leadership theres a high probability that optimus will be practically used almost everywhere just like again ev as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the model s and the models after that thank you for reading god bless us signal vs noise investor masterace thats all of the good folks on rinvesting
2024-12-01,09:54:01,investing,TSLA,Tesla,thoughts on tesla in december so right after tesla recently reached its ath i made the decision to short it and i made some decent returns on that but already closed the position as ibfelt like it was done with its current correction but i still think the company is very overvalued i would think 250 is a fair value or maybe even less lets be honest the overvaluation is due to people having strong feeling for elon musk not bcs the company has an economic moat so the question we need to ask ourselves is will the postive sentiment end at any point in the near future and honestly i do not think so bunch of recent tweets were pretty controversial and all that but i feel like this wont have any further impact atm i just read they are recently started production on the newest y model and its supposed to be available in early 2025 so this might actually push the price up until then but i really feel like it is so risky to invest in the stock maybe a smal call option just to not miss out but also keep liquidity

2024-11-30,03:26:22,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA,umac figuring fmv and the future of warfare last saturday fox prints this piece then on sunday elon tweets this then on wednesday it is announced that don jr joins the board of umac here so what the hell is umac unusual machines it is an absolutely tiny nonfactor of a consumer drone maker located in a warehouse in orlando prior to the election it had a flatlining stock trading around 150 and a market cap around 12m then post election the stock began rising suddenly with a number of large insider purchases then with the announcement of don jr the stock has soared to near 20 and a market cap of around 150m whats the hidden agenda well don jr is a smart ie opportunistic man the war in ukraine has shown the world that land wars are obsolete your 10m abrams tank can be neutralized by a single drone and a grenade that costs less than 500 infantrymen are obsolete they can be hunted mercilessly 24 hours a day by drones day and night rain or shine in the trenches in holes and tunnels around corners remotely using thermal vision drones can only be defended by physical means basically ai controlled counterdrones and bulelts electronic jamming can be effectively countered with electronic shielding see this excellent video by mark rober drones are the future of warfare we will not need people we will not need bombers we just need someone with a suitcase of drones able to infiltrate within a few miles of a desired target release a couple drones with explosives and the target is wiped out no need to send in a 2b b2 bomber equipped with a 250m worth of bombs to take out the target 20000 of drones in a suitcase will suffice imagine also if that suitcase can lay their dormant and be opened remotely as needed to strike any target in the area drone warfare and terrorist strikes are coming to a place near you sadly lastly the us dod spends nearly 2t a year 199t to be more exact this is clearly a level which is unsustainable especially with the rising cost of debt service yes the fed will need to engage in qe3 or 4 or 5 to prevent federal insolvency spending cuts will need to happen and dod with its bloated irrational spending will be the primary targets it has to be you see the trump administration is dismantling the entire neocon apparatus elon and vivek along with jd and hegseth maybe and tulsi and rfk2 the trump avengers are all zealots of the antiestablishment antineocon antiwar agenda i will bet you a nickle that they will chop trillions as vivek targeted 2t in federal spending starting with elons target the f35 military strategy will evolve from enormously expensive concentrated single pieces of power f35 aircraft carriers b2 abrams to inexpensive fleets of cheap drones a la the nova corp these drones are nearly indefensible and they will be controlled by ai buy nvda this is the future of war and probably the doom of civilization it will not be ai that kills us off we wont make it that far rather we will kill ourselves off using aicontrolled drones to fight our wars the country with the smartest fastest and most drones wins we can strike every nuke silo simultaneously and defend our cities and facilities with a dome of drones the us not only has to defend its soil but also that of its allies across the world it is hard to imagine how many drones the us military will need but lets try it is estimated that ukraine is using 10000 drones a month that is 300 a day this just on a small battlefield only a 600 mile frontline capacity constrained military using generation 1 humanoperated drone tactics imagine having to defends tens of thousand critical facilities across the world at all times from a terrorist attack imagine having to be prepared to fight a drone world war all run by ai these systems would be able to control thousands of drones at a time we are talking many millions of drones for basic readiness all operated by nvdadriven ai so lets say the us military will prepare to fight a war globally on a front that is 100x the 600mile front in ukraine this may be low given the literally thousands of targets it will need to defend the battlefield is not contiguous and lets say ai war will use 50x definitely low the drones of humanoperated war this is a 50m standingarmy of drones required for defense 10000 x 100 x 50 that is for just 1 month of war lets say the us military needs an 18month stockpile that is 900m drones lets call it 1b to simplify the math at say 200 per drone that will cost 200b about the cost of 25 f35s to put that in perspective lets say there is an attrition rate of 20 per year due to training and replacement 5year life expectancy that is 250m replacement drones needed per year that is 50b for replacement drones this is significantly cheaper than developing and maintaining hightech weapon systems and soldiers the savings you can achieve by reducing the number of infantry and high tech jets and ships and tanks replacing them with drones are massive enough to bail out the us federal debt sure this change wont happen overnight but it is happenings as we speak thanks to ukraine so what does this all have to do with umac well it is perfectly positioned to ride the wave of this coming military revolution it has the antineocon son of the future president on its advisory board and from what i can tell he is also a very significant shareholder in the company there is no way this deal was just put together in the past few weeks it had to be in the works for months subject to trump winning the election which then triggered new stock issuance by umac donjrs investment and his ascension to the board the ceo of umac is a guy named allan evans you can hear him here back in july 2024 talking about focusing on military contracts and the need for ndaacomplaint manufacturers they are focusing on being an ndaacompliant parts supplier to the drone market these guys know they cant make the sophisticated ai drones that the military will need but they sure as hell can supply the drone parts at a 150m market cap this thing is ridiculously underpriced relative to where it should be after proper hyping i think the market is still trying to figure it out you cant value it on current fundamentals it is just the shell company for donjr and thereby trump to profit off the coming drone military revolution just like truth social wasis for donsr the future of drone warfare has arrived umac is positioned as the domestic ndaacompliant part supplier with donjr it is the supplier of choice i dont know if there is another ndaacompliant drone parts supplier out there probably not given that its mostly all been made thus far in china umac has the pole position with donjr as the driver it just takes a few introductions and investment dollars in manufacturing capabilities elon can help with that for umac to be awarded directly or indirectly purchase orders if you are a defense contractor hoping to win a bid would you not include as part of your proposal some business directed to umac if even 5 of military drone spending makes it through to umac that is 10b in revenue to build the standing army and 25b a year ongoing assuming a 10 net margin that is 1b in profits on the stockpiling and 250m a year for replacements and if there is a ussupplied war somewhere then it would be even higher ignoring stockpiling revenues and valuing it only on the replacement revenue at a reasonable 20x pe ratio this is a 5b market cap company that is 33x from current levels if they are targeted to achieve that in 10 years then that implies a current fmv of 12b which is 8x from the current 150m market cap or about a 160 stock price think 12b is an absurd hype valuation let me introduce you to the psychedelic and weed stocks of a few years ago and also the countless biotech stocks that may someday enter into a phase 1 trial and with those stocks you could not build a case for their valuations it was just hype and blindbuying umac actually has a story and a path towards much bigger things and someone named trump
2024-11-29,19:56:20,investing,TSLA,Tesla,thesis a food for though on fundamentals of tsla in relationship to the era when warren buffet was born hi investing friends granted calculations say tsla is overbought by around 7 to 8x but if we go back in time and imagine its today could tsla be at an era when it was good for warren to buy wrigleys stocks or coca cola stocks i get buffetts picks which are first en masse second they are consumables 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is fasternothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and theres nothing hard about chewing and drinking coke 4th dont require r and d at some point i call them en masse consumables but we have to define consumable it doesnt have to stop with one person it can go on to almost forever with the next generations having said that could tsla be the era for this generation and generations close to it its en masse everybody needs to commute drivings ones self is convenient its consumable in a way coz you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually also energy is bought from tesla via the superchargers among other things and theres always new graduates to buy them 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as its as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum automation now w ai 4th it does require constant r and d but then again technology compensates for that as if theres not much further r and d especially with ai helping with a vehicles physics and material science thank you for reading god bless signal vs noise

2024-11-29,00:44:37,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA,talking with my dad about nvidia over thanksgiving my dad is an active investor has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays yesterday we were talking about nvidia and in our conversation there was something about ai and nvidia and that he didnt know that i thought was common knowledge but im curious how common it actually is or if its a generational gap the knowledge that i thought was common was that the biggest reason nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on ai is that graphics algorithms eg video games cgi rendering etc and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation large matrix multiplication they have spent decades developing gpus for graphics processing other stuff but through no effort on their own the other stuff is now more valuable than the graphics processing their ai hardware is really just the most recent version of their gpus that they sold to consumers to pixar etc not similar they are literally the same thing they didnt somehow develop ai hardware in the past 2 years thats better than everybody elses theyve been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the ai use case this is also why its so hard for a competitor to overtake them they have a lot of ground to catch up on hardware development is really slow really expensive and really difficult this came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an exnvidia currenttesla engineer saying something about how tesla had hardware that was years ahead of nvidia which is not really even remotely likely imho google has spent almost 10 years developing its tpus for machine learning specifically and even then theyre only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally as to why nvidia and not amd its largely because of their software stack and community support they have put a lot of effort into developing cuda cudnn etc and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10 years ago so now its what everybody builds on before all the armchair experts come out of the woodwork yes i know that gpus are general purpose parallel processing units but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost and i know that theyve been tailoring recent generations of gpus more towards ml usecases eg tensorcores and theyre not exactly like gpus of old and yes i know that their datacenter business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards i dont mean to discount their good work theyve done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck tldr the energy it takes to train chatgpt could fry 100000 turkeys this year i didnt check the math
2024-11-29,00:12:45,investing,TSLA,Tesla,the truth about investing no one tells you 1 the system is rigged the financial industry thrives on overcomplicating things to justify fees as charlie munger saidthe whole damn system is corrupt everyone wants easy money fast and that requires a big fee think about it theres 2 trillion locked in mutual funds charging 2 fees while underperforming cheap index funds like the sp 500 whos really winning here hint its not us 2 temperament beats intelligence investing isnt about being the smartestits about controlling your emotions warren buffett the most important quality is temperament not intellect i read a study of a fund that averaged an 18 annual return but the average investor in that fund lost money because they tried to time the market lesson fear and greed will destroy your portfolio faster than any bad stock pick 3 the sp 500 is your cheat code heres your free investing hack buy the sp 500 and chill low fees decades of growth outperforms 98 of funds consistently even charlie munger admitswealth managers have almost zero chance of beating an unmanaged index like the sp so why do people chase stockpicking glory because too many investors confuse excitement with success 4 picking stocks is really hard think its easy to find the next tesla its not and even if you do good luck getting in before the hype buffett if you cant value the stock you cant invest in it you can gamble on it but you cant invest most people buying stocks have never even read a balance sheet picking winners is possible but its incredibly hardthink charlie mungerlevel hard what this all means the truth is the game is rigged for most people to lose but that doesnt mean you cant winthe winners arent the ones chasing hype stocks or flexing their 10baggerstheyre the ones quietly compounding wealth by staying disciplined and focusing on what works consistency patience and a solid strategy so how does this match up with your experience what lessons have you learned the hard way

2024-11-24,19:36:08,investing,AAPL,Apple,how are you thinking about your portfolio given the outcome of the 2024 us election as the new trump administration takes office in 2025 we will all grapple with a rapidly evolving economic landscape the anticipated policies promise significant shifts reminiscent of hungarys economic transformation please let me know if you agree or disagree with any of the picks below understanding the policy shifts 1 economic nationalism and protectionism the administrations america first agenda is expected to increase tariffs on imports tariffs could rise by 1025 mainly targeting chinese goods this move aims to protect domestic industries but may lead to higher consumer prices promote onshoring incentives for companies to relocate manufacturing to the us could include tax breaks and subsidies impact analysis beneficiaries domestic manufacturers like caterpillar inc nyse cat and 3m company nyse mmm could see increased demand due to reduced competition from imports potential losers companies reliant on imported materials or global supply chains like apple may face higher production costs and supplychain disruptions 2 deregulation and tax cuts anticipated measures include corporate tax reductions lowering the rate from 21 to 15 could significantly boost net earnings deregulation efforts especially in energy and finance rolling back regulations like doddfrank could reshape industry operations impact analysis financial sector gains banks like jpmorgan chase and goldman sachs might experience increased profitability due to relaxed lending regulations and lower taxes energy sector surge traditional oil and gas companies like exxon mobil corporation and chevron corporation could benefit from reduced environmental regulations and expanded drilling rights 3 increased government intervention potential actions sectorspecific policies favoring industries aligned with national priorities possibly leading to subsidies for sectors like defense and infrastructure unpredictable regulatory changes sudden policy shifts could affect longterm planning and investment impact analysis defense contractors advantage companies like lockheed martin and northrop grumman may secure lucrative government contracts amid increased defense spending risk of cronyism firms with close ties to the administration could outperform while others may struggle to compete what lessons can we learn from hungary under viktor orbán nationalization and heavy taxation foreign companies faced significant taxes reducing foreign investment favoritism towards domestic firms companies aligned with government objectives received advantages distorting competition market volatility unpredictable policies led to investor uncertainty and capital flight

2024-11-23,16:50:13,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA,isnt rebalancing selling your winners and keeping your losers ive been thinking about the philosophy of rebalancing the purpose of rebalancing your portfolio just buy all stocks bro excluded is to maintain a risk profile thats consistent with your goals so say if nvda went up by 300 and intc got halved and now nvda is 80 of your portfolio the philosophy of rebalancing would demand you to sell a large portion of nvda and invest in intc that strategy if we look at the chart doesnt work so well for your wallet so heres me wondering if rebalancing on the surface is buy low sell high when in reality its just sell your winners and buy more losers on the converse with an outsized nvda position you just increased your risk on one company big time so if nvda gets hit by say an antitrust or jensens brain scan ai go skynet youre gonna get decimated theres a lot of moving gears in this decision

2024-11-04,13:26:25,investing,AAPL,Apple,boeing navigating challenges securing growtha resilient investment opportunity in aerospace boeing as a potential investment opportunity boeing stands as one of the most important players in the aerospace industry with a heavily established brand and legacy that commands trust around the world despite recent operational and financial challenges affecting its stock price boeings intrinsic value and reputation position it as a viable investment while relatively shortterm setbacks have impacted shareholder sentiment these issues are likely irrelevant in terms of boeings longterm prospects as a leader in aviation for a company of boeings stature resilience and success are inevitable making it a viable investment opportunity amidst doubt in the markets boeings brand strength and market perception since its founding in 1916 boeing has had a longstanding reputation for safety and reliability the company has bolstered its reputation through engineering marvels like the boeing 747 although boeing has recently had many notable incidents they have focused on being transparent and open with its shareholders for example production issues with the 787 dreamliner delays in the 777x program software glitches affecting 737 max deliveries supply chain disruptions and quality control concerns have been openly handled by the company as they have been in direct communication with the national transportation safety board in order to improve and learn from their mistakes another key factor is brand loyalty boeings brand strength is comparable to companies such as cocacola and apple this loyalty and strength has been based on customer trust market stability innovation and collaboration ultimately boeings longstanding reputation allows it to build strong brand loyalty further bolstering its position in the aerospace industry and ensuring its continued relevance and resilience in the market boeing has a huge brand name that involves years of experience in the market which competitors like comac and others lack boeing also has government contracts on military vehicles with the v22 osprey and air force one being two of the most wellknown three years ago chinese airframer comac landed on the us governments blacklist of communist chinese military companies where it could face sanctions and other boycotts this shone a negative light on comacs reliability in combination with its long standing history of serving us citizens boeing is set far ahead of their competitors operational challenges and financial setbacks boeing has faced several operational and financial setbacks that have significantly impacted its stock price including manufacturing delays and supply chain disruptions particularly in the production of its 737 max and 787 dreamliner aircraft additionally protests from employees and labor unions over working conditions have strained internal dynamics contributing to production slowdowns financially boeing has struggled with rising costs and has faced accusations of fraud and misleading investors including a highprofile lawsuit related to the 737 max crashes these issues have collectively damaged investor confidence further pressuring boeings stock performance as it navigates these challenges boeings financial strategy has recently centered on a significant 10 billion credit agreement aimed at facilitating recovery in the wake of industry challenges this move not only addresses immediate liquidity needs but also signals confidence in longterm growth prospects the funds are expected to support investment in new technologies and production capabilities enhancing boeings competitive position sustained market demand for aircraft boeings 400 billion order backlog highlights sustained demand and supports financial stability amid challenges orders for key models like the 737 max and 787 dreamliner show strong client confidence positioning boeing for recovery as it addresses production issues this pipeline of demand reinforces boeings market position providing investors a solid foundation for longterm growth the global demand for air travel has received significant growth over recent years particularly in emerging markets such as china india and southeast asia rising incomes urbanization economic growth and an expanding middle class are driving increased travel in regions like china india and southeast asia contributing to a broader shift in air travel trends these areas are experiencing significant growth in demand caused by economic expansion and government investments china is on track to become the worlds largest aviation market by the mid2030s with massive infrastructure projects underway india supported by initiatives like udan is expected to become the thirdlargest aviation market within a decade as air travel increasingly replaces other modes of domestic transport in southeast asia countries like indonesia vietnam and thailand are seeing strong growth with lowcost carriers making flights more accessible these regions will shape the future of global air travel where infrastructure and sustainable technologies will be essential valuation and investment prospects since its 52week high boeing has dropped 40 this fall in share price is due to ongoing production delays regulatory challenges weakened defense contract demand broader economic concerns and disruptions from recent labor strikes affecting suppliers in 2019 the stock price was a staggering 430 this peak came before the 737max crises and the covid19 pandemic boeing has dropped nearly 65 since then through boeings fall over the past 5 years their competitors lockheed martin general dynamics and northrop grumman have grown 85 75 and 94 respectively despite this divergence boeing still has a 1520 market share in the defense and aerospace industry domestically in addition to their 4550 stake in commercial aviation as they are in a duopoly with airbus additionally boeings extensive order backlog signals strong demand suggesting a potential path to recovery as global air travel rebounds while challenges remain addressing these operational hurdles could enable boeing to leverage its dominant position in aerospace driving a potential comeback toward prepandemic performance levels key risk factors impacting boeing boeing has a number of regulation issues like the recertification of the 737 max which was heavily scrutinized by the faa and other aviation authorities the aircraft was allowed for flight but boeings continuous oversight and compliance has been a focus since 2021 boeing has also had production quality issues specifically with the 787 dreamliner having damaged parts unsecured fuel lines and multiple other issues additionallyin 2021 the european union proposed stricter emissions standards which may affect boeings future production practices boeing continues to be under investigation for various issues under the faa and other global aviation authorities about lying to regulators about the safety of aircrafts and cutting corners boeings defense and space division has struggled with substantial challenges over recent years despite its strong foothold in defense boeing faces ongoing challenges including production delays and quality control concerns in key programs like the kc46 pegasus and p8 poseidon additionally the company has struggled with significant cost overruns and navigating a competitive landscape despite this boeing is committed to innovation and improving efficiency which is vital for securing future government contracts on the other hand marred by years of glitches boeing has also faced over 16 billion in cost overruns and delays in its space sector boeings starliner project has faced many setbacks while their rival elon musks spacex has made 43 visits to the international space station since 2019 as a result boeing is considering selling this project and stepping away from the space sector after over 60 years in the industry however nasa and boeing are actively working to solve these issues to get starliner up and running once again which if successful could diminish some concerns associated with the companys future in the space sector boeings path to recovery and future outlook in conclusion boeings promising potential for recovery is characterized by two factors its substantial market sharestrong brand image and how harshly the market has reacted to the companys setbacks ignoring major potential in the companys extensive order backlogs boeings major losses such as the pandemicincited 737 max crisis allegations of fraud in overstated production goals federal investigation into regulatory noncompliance and quality control issues across multiple aircraft models were largely managerial issues that are being priced in too harshly ignoring the fact that boeing maintains a notable global presence in the aerospace industry approximately 50 of the machine supply in the commercial aircraft market is due to boeing the other 50 belonging to airbus with boeing also controlling about 20 of the defense and aerospace industry these statistics emphasize the companys strong presence highlighting that the managerials issues of the past can be overcome

2024-11-03,10:42:17,investing,AAPL,Apple,buybacks or ipos which is better as a retail investor my take advantages of buybacks 1 boosting share value buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding which can increase earnings per share eps and can lead to a higher stock price eg apple has a series of buybacks for billions of dollars that has benefitted a lot of shareholders 2 boosting investor confidence buybacks can boost investor sentiment investors interpret it as a sign that the company expects to perform well in the future advantages of ipos 1 growth potential ipos provide an opportunity to invest in a company at an early stage potentially reaping substantial rewards as the company grows 2 market sentiment ipos often attract considerable market attention and investor interest which can lead to initial price surges example paras defence was listed at a premium of 171 leading to instant gains for buyers in a short time it does not end here the share price surged by another 143 within 3 weeks giving more gains to the shareholders while buybacks are good for existing shareholders as they can sell their shares above the market price ipos provide decent prices for retail investors to accumulate shares in case they are able to get allocation for the applied ipo what do you think about ipos and buybacks especially for retail investors share your views in the comments

2024-11-01,11:09:44,investing,TSLA,Tesla,need help regarding intrinsic value so the stock in question is tesla i have done lots of research into the company and its finances and have used multiple methods in order to determine an intrinsic value including margin of safety to find a nice entry price the methods i have used are 1 discounted cash flow 5049 2 multiples valuation model 3181 3 grahams valuation model 17941 this is not to say that my valuations are correct by any means and i accept there could be faults in my calculations my concern is that grahams valuation model has produced the highest iv by some margin however it seems quite reasonable given how tesla stock has traded over the last few years that this could be fairly accurate i just want some advice on how people would use these numbers would you a use grahams alone as a benchmark for iv b try and find an average between all 3 models and use that as an iv value 81 would be the average but at the risk that the stock may never drop as low as this so i may miss out on the stock altogether edit please offer your advice i am trying my best to learn and would be handy to see what other people do in this situation

2024-10-30,17:05:08,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA,nvda is more than an ai bubble i am a little confused with some fo the discourse regarding nvda specifically those who call the company a result of an ai bubble and compare it to those the dotcom bubble i feel those situations are so different because firstly most of those dotcom bubble companies never had real earnings they essentially got to the point where they just added dotcom to companies that never had a chance of profitability not only does nvda have earnings but their main concern is just keeping up with demand the only real concern i see about nvda is whatever administration enters office within the start of the new year and how they deal with china and taiwain especially because of taiwains impact on the semicondcutor industry with tsmc as the leading producer of semiconductors especially because intel cannot keep up and is being left behind

2024-10-15,19:01:21,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA,frontier tech portfolio hey all sharing what im calling my frontier tech portfolio broken down by percentages im looking for valuable input feedback and discussion around it and if it happens to be helpful to anyone even better i do want to clarify a few things im focused on ai bitcoin and space investment vehicles or not i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise are poised for massive growth and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades lets just call this a frontier tech portfolio to give it a name i can reference im not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis whether you think ai is all hype or you are antibitcoin and think its a ponzi scheme or you think space is a waste of resources or anything along these lines thats ok i respect that perspective but id like to avoid arguing about it we just disagree about some fundamental things and you wont convince me im simply wrong i am looking for feedback on blind spots poormissing assumptions overconfidence things im not considering or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis im not just looking for people to agree with me though that is interesting input as well i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy yes im missing some key areas of what many would call frontier tech biotech green nuclear energy cybersecurity to name a few but i just dont have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where im most confident and able to stay up to date im trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff whos less familiar with one or any of the spacescategories my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong longterm confidence in growth not stuff i trade frequently and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting sexy but that i dont know enough about smci pltr altcoins as some good examples i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust andor admire ok with that out of the way lets dive in 30 ai 10 nvda 5 soxq 15 balanced mixed of now msft aapl googl meta amzn high level to me this category is absolutely going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades ais potential is not chatgpt or smarter versions of it its far beyond what were seeing from llms today if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the ai space listen to not what they believe is gonna happen but to what they know is coming because theyve already used the tech usually 12 years before the public even sees it these people are overwhelmed amazed terrified enchanted bewildered to me thats just very interesting i believe what some others do that were in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution im not bothered much that ai isnt monetizing in demonstrable repeatable ways i think theres been and continues to be enough fundamental increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think as for the individual stocks ill do a quick dive here to be clear i dont think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious but seems useful to give my favorite things about each 10 nvda these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing their moat is extensive its not just gpu blackwell demand its their cuda programming language and universe and stickiness of it its the longterm horizon required for their data centers that makes 510 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff its ceo jensen pushing them and already looking for the next big thing just a lot of confidence here 5 soxq i like this semiconductor etf a little more than smh because its more diverse smh is like 25 nvda which is great if i didnt already allocate so much there and its got a low expense ratio 019 i love this exposure because the ai industry is driven by these companies eg tsmc micron broadcam qualcomm amd amat 15 mix of these now excellent leadership and integrated heavily with nvda tech will benefit hugely from ai boom with aidriven automation meta founderrun and with a clear vision demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building ai models meeting consumer needs being pioneers in tech at large aapl will probably benefit the most from consumerfacing ai products and implementation strong leadership amzn aws is a profit monster that will be huge for ai tools and services and data centers logistics and ecom will be big ai beneficiaries strong leadership msft deeply embedded in the ai revolution with its investment in openai ai integration into azure and microsoft 365 excellent leadership googl ai pioneer with deepmind brain they still own search have enormous amount of data questionable leadership but im holding for now no tsla no i just dont trust elon musk enough at this point and i need confidence in a companys leadership for me to invest in its stock theres a big chance im missing out their robotics division might be incredible but im able to sleep ok with that im also missing plenty of other ai picks i know that these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence 30 bitcoin 25 bitcoin itself cold storage or an etf 5 mstr high level why bitcoin books have been written about it but to shortly summarize my perspective its quite volatile and risky shortterm and quite growthoriented and thus far safe longterm excellent store of value wonderful technology mathcode based and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system limited supply thats only decreasing over time immutable now adopted by many big institutions goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years some days its hard to justify not putting more into this one but for now im convinced that diversification is the better longterm play 20 bitcoin many would argue that holding actual bitcoin ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here but there are also arguments for fbtc or ibit helpful in taxadvantaged accounts trusting an etf seems safer to some very debatable i do some cold storage and some fbtc they selfcustody their bitcoin which not everyone does either way just bitcoin its the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high 5 mstr this is a leveraged bitcoin play strong chance it outpaces btc growth rate during bull runs i may shift some mstr profits to bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 41 btcmstr ratio 30 space 10 asts 10 rklb 5 lunr high level the tech for space finally seems to match the potential thats been talked about for decades and decades for a while spacex really proved this out almost singlehandedly but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category my favorites are these three heres why 10 asts you should read the kook report google it for a true deep dive but to hit my high level points they are prerevenue but with the potential for massive growth effectively their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech they own tons of patents they are 5 years ahead of what many think will be a winnertakesmost race their partners already include att verizon vodafone rakuten american tower bell canada and more they have excellent leadership i find this a riskyish play as they have tons to still accomplish but the potential growth is enormous 10 rklb effectively a spacex competitor on smaller rockets with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth i think still heavily undervalued today nerdyawesome leadership vertically integrated as telecom defense and general research spending expands to space economy rklb is positioned very very well 5 lunr ive spent less time researching them than the other two but my confidence level in the riskreward is still pretty high key player in the lunar economy one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon very niche but valuable moat huge potential good amount of risks ahead 10 cash to buy them juicy dips ok thats my frontier tech portfolio summary to repeat this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be betterthanaverage returns over the next 10 years i recognize that this discussion didnt even really touch share price eps pe profitability revenue or other key details this just isnt the place where im getting into that i can say that im comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth and what companiesstocksassets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth thanks for reading the information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice please consult a professional advisor before making

2024-10-08,00:50:46,investing,TSLA,Tesla,do you get the urge to gamble with stocks and how you deal with it so in a few accounts i have accumulated 100k over the years with the usual advise of sp 500 index funds set it and forget but every few months i get the urge to sell a part of it and gamble in individual stocks i did that with tesla in 2018 yes it was kind of a gamble then and that paid off a few others paid off too but then some didnt pay off overall am i beating the market i am not sure with rollovers from one job to the next that dont keep track of previous account gains but i am not loosing either with the strategy how do you keep this urgeitch away just keeping it in sp 500 is so boring edit based on comments i want to add that i do gamble in casinos table games but not more than 5001000 a year its fun but i have the thinking that i will loose that 100 the high from stocks which is 1k10k gain in a short time is at another level i dont bet on penny stocks these are mostly blue chip like when apple or amazon or chipotle does down i would buy it and then sell in 16 months or just sit on it until it goes up sometimes stocks like neo never go up i also only sell options
2024-10-07,16:03:21,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA,to sell or not sell long positions why or why not hi everyone this posit is about my holdings in nvda meta i would like to be a discussion on benefits of sellingholding long positions that are up significantly im sure there are others in similar positions who may want to know if this is too close to personal advice remove if necessary i have been long on both these for a handful of years meta 21 shares 17135 avg cost total return to date 893200 24756 nvda 11975 shares 5526 avg cost total return to date 845000 12787 my unrealized gains are getting up there whats invested in these the unrealized gains are just over 13 of my portfolio i am unsure if i should sell my positions and buy back in albeit at a higher priceseems kind of silly i know its unlikely these will crash even a considerable market adjustment wouldnt really affect my positions since i got in early i am just nervous having all these unrealized gains i dont have to pay tax on these gains until sold so i have been leaning to just letting it be and hopefully continue to grow these companies have been beating earnings every quarter with no real tell tale signs of slowingmaybe im wrong let me know your thoughts

2024-10-06,17:23:08,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA,is a financial advisor necessary so ive had a financial advisor for a while now and i completely forgot about the account because since acquiring this advisor however many years ago ive started doing my own investing now i have a roth ira with fidelity that is managed by fidelity under 25k has no fees and above 25k is 35 most of my money is in my brokerage account in things like nvidia amd and voo i also have growth stocks like rivn that make up a much smaller percentage of my portfolio my point is now that ive seen my own gains and the fidelity roth ira is so cheap comparatively is there even a reason to stick with a financial advisor i have 2500 with this guy for comparison i have 15k between my roth brokerage hysa in fidelity and frankly is there any reason i shouldnt just take that money and put it in my roth or brokerage account in voo im realizing that a financial advisor might be for the people that know literally nothing about investing and panic sell and buy dont invest at all because they dont understand how investing works at all i know the raw cost basis of having the advisor is more expensive im not asking about the fees but more so the gains that are possible personally vs with an advisor
2024-10-05,19:12:12,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA,american funds generally exclude nvidia so disappointing i inherited a sizable roth ira and looked at the portfolio composition and was disappointed that nvidia is not even a part of many of their funds the 4 funds that are in the portfolio have such a large overlap it makes no sense why the financial planner would do this the expense ratios are extremely high and the holdings make no sense either american balanced fund abalx mostly microsoft broadcom and google capital income builder caibx mostly broadcom phillip morris and abby vie the growth fund of america agthx mostly microsoft meta and google ahanvidia is actually in there but only at 35 of the fund the investment company of america aivsx microsoft broadcom microsoft google meta the amount of money that was lost by not having more more exposure to nvidia is absurd why dont their funds just track the sp 500 i plan to hold onto this roth for the next 10 years let it grow then make a lump sum rmd but i am very upset over the high expense ratios of about 063 i am considering selling these positions and buying just one good one that has more of nvidia i really dont like these expense ratios and it almost feels like extortion i have also considered looking into an inherited roth ira transfer to fidelity if thats even possible is it even possible to transfer an inherited roth ira

2024-12-21,20:30:55,dividends,NVDA,NVIDIA,kraft heinz khc analysis ive seen lately people post about khc about its dividend and ask if its a good dividend stock to get into i am excited to finally speak on this topic as ive been holding the stock for over two years now get ready to learn about one of the most exciting and exhilarating stocks in the market nvda doesnt stack up to khc amzn childs play to khc buckle up and get ready for this giant and be ready to be smitten spoiler tldr khc is kind of lame kraft heinz is a stock where when the merger happened between kraft and heinz back in 2015 this was going to be a food giant with a plethora of brands under their umbrella the phrase of too big to fail is what i thought when i heard the news originally fast forward to 2024 and this merger has not created a superstar company from the accusations from the sec regarding their accounting to the billions of dollars they took in write offs in their brands after the merger and having to sell some of their brands like planters it hasnt gone well for them dont take my word for it look at the numbers volume and price changes from 2019 to 2020 kraft heinz saw a 34 increase in volume for their products while they did a 31 increase on price after that period of 2019 to 2020 that was the last time we can see volume increased since then volume has decreased but the company has continued to increase prices if you look at other packaged foods stocks gis cag sjm etc you see the same trend where sales have been stalling or slow to grow while these companies have had to increase prices from a cumulative analysis looking at the data above from 2019 to q3 of 2024 khc has increased prices by 291 while volume has decreased by 93 salesincome here we can see that kraft heinz has seen net sales stay pretty consistent growth in 2020 but since then very minimal growth it screams a company that is stuck trying to get traction and gain momentum cashflow one thing to notice with kraft heinz cash flow is the amount of long term debt that has been paid off in 2019 they were carrying 29 billion in debt and currently from the last q3 earnings they had about 20 billion in debt they have reduced their debt but their operation has generated lower cash which can be attributable to their declining sales as well as them selling off some of their brands like planters in an attempt to reduce their portfolio size they did announce last year that they were going to start share buybacks which is nice to see as they were not doing that when they were focused on debt the market personally i thought with inflation over the past few years i thought the stocks focused on at home food would thrive however that hasnt been the case i pulled a few packaged foods stocks to show that from jan of 2020 to now you can see a majority of them have seen their market cap go down khc you can say well they their market cap has increased since then but with only a 2 gain in market cap in the past almost 5 years why even invest in them the reality is that inflation didnt just impact the fast food industry it impacted groceries and these stocks products the problem with a majority of these companies has been a push to increase prices to offset decliningslow volume and consumers pushed back with this pushback look at companies with large private labels walmart costco and kroger since jan of 2020 they have seen their market caps increased by 131 214 and 108 respectively all of these companies also pay dividends as well albeit at a lower yield but the growth in these stocks has severely outpaced any dividends gained by the food stocks i listed previously let alone khc company market cap in millions except for change bear case against khc the bear case against khc is that they cant grow and they have shown a lack of growth with so much of their portfolio being processed or packaged foods and with a majority of the us trying to be more health conscious nothing in their portfolio screams healthy one of their specific market is also now facing competition say what you want about lunchly and the controversy behind it but its back by influencers that have a target audience the same target audience that khcs lunchables also focus on there are also rumors of khc trying to get rid of their oscar meyer brand another brand to offload as they juggle their portfolio to figure out what can be successful honestly if warren buffetberkshire cut their loses and sells this off that would be brutal as they are one of the largest holders of it bull case for khc though the past few paragraphs have bashed this stock there are two sides to every story khc as stated had a lot of debt and they have done a great job at reducing it helping their balance sheet and their cashflow the same argument against oscar meyer can be a positive as they recognize brands that are not performing well and focus on other items i do feel khc in the past two years has tried experimenting with their products and focusing on what they can change from brand changes to adding new products some products like their signature series of thick cut shredded cheese i think was a fresh addition to their product line that is something they should have done a while ago i have seen more ads from their products lately compared to prior years so i feel this is not only due to the decline in sales but also with their balance sheet getting rid of so much debt i feel that is why are looking more into marketing and rd ultimately i think this is a company stuck in neutral a turnaround for them isnt going to happen overnight its going to be a process looking at the earnings call presentations and listening to key notes i do believe the company is trying to lay the pieces in place to turnaround the company like focusing on their market share in the workplace food services but some of their actions plans i am skeptical launches of limited time mac and cheese flavors such as jalapeno and everything bagel i question how much these limited run items generate profit when most of you reading this probably havent even heard of those items if their intent is to gather data on consumer preferences why not just utilize a test kitchen environment with participants vs on depending on orders from consumers when you need to market that product to them personally people looking at this stock for a dividend because its yield is over 5 right now i think need to look and understand that they have been paying 160 a year since 2019 and since 2020 its been paying out between 3 and 5 which one can say wow what a consistent dividend which is true but this also paints how the company isnt able to keep sustained growth there are a plethora of other stocks or etfs that pay a dividend at a lower yield then khc but have returned to shareholders growth in the value of stock that surpasses the dividends of khc
2024-12-21,17:08:36,dividends,NVDA,NVIDIA,the marathon continues i remember seeing a quote by warren buffet back in 20219 that said something like if you dont find a way to make money in your sleep youll work until youre dead so in january of 2020 i took the big leap since hearing that and taking inventory with myself i felt that building wealth through financial markets was my best choice i bought books i watched youtube i read forums and did everything i could to learn what i needed to i built my first portfolio in 2020 and added to it as much as i could i was broke college kid in 2021 i found stable work and decided i wanted to grow this portfolio so i added 20 every single day for the entire year in 2022 i took a step back from contributing as much as possible and chased some hobbies in 2023 i decided it was time to get back on that contribution horse an in 2024 i have invested aggressively across several different accounts in 2025 i have the most knowledge of financial markets thats i have ever had and im ready to apply that knowledge and see how it helps me grow my accounts an with that knowledge my risk tolerance has grown allowing me to wield tools that can help grow the dollar value of my accounts my point in all of this is that for a lot of us this wont happen over night it really is brick by brick consistently over great lengths of time will always yield favorable results in 2025 dont get discouraged by market fluctuations and stay the course hone in on your why and tunnel vision that thanks for coming to my ted talk holdings from the account that the screenshot above tracks are below currently my holdings include schd nvda aapl jpm cony nvdy and tsly id like to add spyi jepq and divo over the year

2024-12-11,08:22:05,dividends,NVDA,NVIDIA,hows my portfolio hi im 42 and in australia and my portfolio is pitifully small and quite frankly embarrassing i am trying to build up as much as i can while im working to get myself a decent return via dividends and investment value growth i only started 3 years ago and only have approximately 14k spread over 135 investments with a current return of around 20 it consists of a mix of etfs and individual stocks 25 etfs and 75 individual stocks as per below at the moment i can only afford to invest 75 per week but i am aiming to increase that to 100 per week next year i reinvest any dividends i earn i also contribute 30 per week to my super too which is only 220k at the moment i have a crytpo portfolio of around 10k should be double that but i lost half to an exchange that went under and i dont actively invest any cash into crypto but i am constantly adding to crypto via mining my strategy at the moment is to invest in my 2 top performers of individual stocks each week and 2 top performers of etf stocks each week the best one of each gets 40 of my investment and the 2nd best each get 10 ill occasionally buy something else that i read about or can see a future for i recently sold a heap of my worst performers and reinvested those into my best performers if i see solid movements up over a few weeks of some of my poorer performers ill focus on buying up on those to catch the ride up then revert back to focusing on my best performers i am always reading up on different companies and new breakthroughs within industries and public trends to help with where i invest too i am a long term holder and dont have time or any aspiration to day trade i am looking for a minimum of 10 to 15 years and will increase my input over this time when i can afford to i dont want to get to retirement and not have enough to live out the rest of my years so im doing what i can to accumulate as much as i can while im working i want to get to a point where dividends contribute more to my portfolio than what i invest out of my own pocket what should i focus on investing in out of what i have here to achieve this with me not knowing anything about investing is what i have done any good or am i doing it all wrong nvdanasdaq1775 smhnasdaq611 wmtnyse324 fmgasx320 hackasx303 mcknyse287 rioasx272 afiasx255 geonyse247 wesasx240 qyldnasdaq239 esponasdaq228 bhpasx225 spynyse217 ivvnyse207 zipasx204 vrtxnasdaq197 msftnasdaq184 slfasx175 vtinyse171 asmlnasdaq165 cvxnyse163 rmsasx156 ibitnasdaq153 cahnyse153 nxtasx140 cbaasx131 drrasx099 lmgasx089 argasx087 tslanasdaq082 jbhasx081 wxhgasx080 zimasx072 rrcnyse064 bloknyse062 brkanyse054 uuuunyse053 cenyse051 wdsasx051 vasasx050 amdnasdaq050 plsasx047 aglasx046 s32asx044 agcasx043 gncasx042 espoasx042 tsmnyse042 bgaasx040 qreasx039 jmsasx039 metanasdaq038 vgsasx034 oooasx034 khcnasdaq031 tlsasx030 mmmnyse029 qqqnasdaq029 syiasx028 allasx027 konyse026 bpnyse025 amznnasdaq024 igoasx023 ozrasx023 hpqnyse020 ddnyse019 aaplnasdaq018 catnyse016 schxnyse016 goognasdaq015 googlnasdaq015 qcomnasdaq015 ltrasx015 asiaasx015 bwpasx014 wc8asx013 lycasx012 vdbaasx012 smcinasdaq012 wcnasx011 cvsnyse010 cxoasx008 tqqqnasdaq008 tmlasx008 wdcnasdaq008 pyplnasdaq007 arkknyse007 clwasx007 wowasx007 aucasx006 ivvasx006 cseasx006 blcnnasdaq005 colasx005 xtcasx005 eldasx004 fdvasx004 solvnyse004 dreasx004 ragasx004 ph2asx004 glnasx003 dxbasx003 lgpasx003 btbtnasdaq003 crspnasdaq003 wbdnasdaq003 intcnasdaq003 a8gasx002 syrasx002 riotnasdaq002 inrasx002 rziasx002 lisasx002 rivnnasdaq002 imuasx001 galasx001 fgrasx001 ovtasx001 brosnyse001 cznasx001 ktaasx001 anxasx001 shelnyse001 aruasx001 ig6asx000 thrasx000 spqasx000 nmtasx000 nrzasx000 pfltnyse000 rneasx000

2024-11-22,18:23:50,dividends,AAPL,Apple,what do you think about qcom qualcomm it is one of the few tech companies with an almost decent yield which sadly it is too low for significant growth at current levels but im going to be honest i picked a position in it because of the capital growth potential the only problem is that that potential doesnt seem to want to coalesce into upward movement anybody here tracking qcom basically they have wonderful plans to move past apple they are scheduled to lose a chunk of their business there with a move towards the pc auto and iot markets right now the share price seems to be drifting as investors just wait for more clarity if this was a growth portfolio i would be fine with that it is just a risk datapoint to balance but as part of my dividends portfolio im second guessing my choice 208 yield is just too low to grow into anything meaningful anytime soon
2024-11-21,20:08:28,dividends,AAPL,Apple,updates for getting payment in qualcomms 75m settlement hey guys i already posted about the qualcomm settlement but since we got an update i decided to post it again its about the anticompetitive practices scandal they had a few years ago for newbies back in 2017 qualcomm was accused of anticompetitive practices and only targeting big companies like apple offering them reduced fees when this news came out investors sued them for the stock drop caused by this but the good news now is that they agreed to pay 75m to investors to solve this huge mess and i just found out that they are taking claims after the deadline so if you got hit back then you can check here if you are eligible and file for the payment anyways do you think qualcomm will finally make an offer to buy intel and has anyone here had qcom when this anticompetitive scandal happened if so how much were your losses

2024-09-24,21:28:19,dividends,TSLA,Tesla,looking for advicediscussion on what to adjust in my portfolio to make it hands off for future growth through dividendsgrowth stocks for a couple years hey guys new here i 21m only recently have been getting into investing but have some questions that i have not found very good answers for i am not going all in on tsla i will be going on a lds mission sometime in the near future and will be unable to access or manage my account for 2 years how can i adjust my portfolio to have a better consistent growthdividend growth while i am gone i will be adding a couple hundred each month until i leave and some while i am gone but other than that nothing will be adjusted other than a family member buying a mix of pre chosen etfs with the cash put into the account so i need to make some short term low risk changes that will allow growth while being risk adverse i am new to investing so i have no clue what would be the best course of action for my current situation i have 3 accounts my main account my roth ira and my random robinhood meme stocks my main account does not allow recurring investments so i will be moving to robinhood for recurring investments i am not opposed to risk but i dont want to let something tank my account while i am unable to manage it so something of moderate risk should be fine but not all of it currently all i really know is that i need a good amount of diversity but also because i am young i can be a bit more aggressive with my risk taking which is what i have been currently doing let me know your opinions to sum up my post ill be gone for 2 years soon and will have zero access to manage my account someone will put the money i prepped in at regular intervals and will most likely be able to buy some pre chosen etfs in monthly occurrences but it cannot be complicated 1 or 2 stocks in a 4060 type split as the most complicated until then how should i adjust my portfolio to adjust for zero management growth any specific stock choices or should i just follow a 70 etf 30 stock split theory here are my current holdings main account roth ira robinhood these are my recurring investments currently putting 50 a month into recurring and a couple hundred into my other accounts each month

2024-09-18,02:32:55,dividends,NVDA,NVIDIA,transition from growth to dividends hey everyone so as the title implies im curious what everyone thinks about making the transition from a growth stock heavy portfolio to a dividend stock heavy portfolio background 30 year old with just over 100k in a brokerage account approximately 70k in other retirementtax advantaged accounts the brokerage account as it sits right now is 66 nvidia with 25 in divo jepi and pflt the remaining percentages are in some growth stocks i am toying with the idea of restructuring the portfolio so that it is more dividend heavy but i would obviously have to sell nvidia to redistribute in any significant way the thing im having trouble with is my hesitance to let any of my nvidia position go nvidia position is 575 shares at 36 average costcurrently 115 per share it is my personal belief that 575 shares of nvidia could be worth a very large amount of money in 5 to 10 years time maybe my doubt is coming from hitting the 30 year old milestone and im overthinking things but figured id ask for your opinions thanks to anyone who takes the time to respond

2024-09-14,19:18:07,dividends,TSLA,Tesla,young people can buy divs i just want to give some hope to the young investors out there who are interested in dividends but keep running into know it alls telling you to only buy them once you are 60 you should not buy all dividends when you are young but you can view them as a way to capture and retain wealth easier in the event that you make solid gains in growth and would like to lock them in for example if you make a bunch of money on a tech run up with tsla for example then you can trim positions and add to a safer dividend stock if you dont want to deal with the volatility at this point it becomes a game of which dividend stock feels the best to lock in some of those gains i am 29 and have personally bought my largest holdings in dmlp and epd over my working career so far due to looking for things when they sell off and believing in the dividends under the company i have achieved very high yield on cost with both of them dmlp is yielding me 3040 on initial investment and has already paid me more back in dividends than my initial investment was this was just a simple oil royalty play epd is yielding me around 12 and is one of the largest energy dealers in the usa with tons of infrastructural pipelines that cant be easily replaced both of these are pretty easy buy and holds for my entire life at this point and i dont need to worry about extreme volatility except for oil prices which are sort of volatile at times as well my current monthly div payments are up to 15k and now covers my mortgage if i needed it to i would be shooting myself in the foot if i had slept on these two massive div payers when they were low price provides so much safety as well as double digit returns forever now as long as they dont go out of business i dont need any sort of special rally to make 10 and it is a very nice feeling of diversification if you are young use both growth and dividends stop listening to people who argue all for 1 or the other you can swing back and forth between when looking for varying levels of safety at times

2024-09-12,16:25:32,dividends,NVDA,NVIDIA,whats stocks are on your radar was hoping nvidia would go under 100 again but doesnt seem like it will so im watching and researching on stocks that could grow exponentially within the months what would you recommend
2024-09-12,01:55:54,dividends,NVDA,NVIDIA,nvda up 742 today nvdy up only 406 nvda stock had quite a rally today gaining 742 in contrast the etf nvdy that sells nvda options gained only 406 it gained but less than nvda this is a perfect example of the problem with yieldmax funds why is that well because nvdy doesnt own any nvda stock only options that offset each other to create synthetic shares of stock it doesnt participate in all of the gains when nvda stock rallies its built into the design of nvdy and all yieldmax funds the yieldmax fund managers state as much in the nvdy prospectus which i suspect most yieldmax buyers dont bother reading an investment in the fund is not an investment in nvda the funds strategy will cap its potential gains if nvda shares increase in value the funds strategy is subject to all potential losses if nvda shares decrease in value which may not be offset by income received by the fund the fund does not invest directly in nvda fund shareholders are not entitled to any nvda dividends well ok i can hear people saying but how about that juicy dividend that nvdy pays that should surely compensate for the capped gains in share price right not exactly while nvdy does pay a much larger dividend than nvda it cant offset the capped gains in share price compared to nvda during the past month nvda shares gained 724 select 1 month time frame while nvdy shares lost 423 select 1 month time frame nvdy paid a 13548 per share dividend on september 9 at a share price of 209632 which added 647 to the total return of nvdy during the past month for a total return of 423 647 224 compared to a total return of 724 for nvda the juicy dividend couldnt offset the lost gains in share price as the yieldmax fund managers warned the funds strategy will cap its potential gains if nvda shares increase in value the funds strategy is subject to all potential losses if nvda shares decrease in value which may not be offset by income received by the fund nvdy sacrifices gains for current income the more nvda stock has rallies like today the farther and farther nvdy will fall behind nvda and the dividend cant compensate for the lost capped gains you might make money with nvdy but you will likely make more money with nvda this can be seen if you compare the growth of 10000 invested with reinvested dividends in nvda and nvdy since may 2023 when nvdy was created it includes periods when both nvda and nvdy had rallies rising prices and corrections falling prices nvdy 25099 nvda 37842 nvdy is ok if you are already rich you are retired and need dividends for income and you are willing to accept the reduced gains of nvdy for current income for everyone else you are likely better off with actual nvda stock than nvdy
2024-09-09,07:03:18,dividends,NVDA,NVIDIA,nvdy is this now a good buy nvidia is one of if not the most popular stock in the entire market it has a massive presence when it comes to call options and nvdy is currently near alltime lows considering nvda has entered a correction while continuing to post great earningsbut not meteoric earnings like before with expectations of a slow rise over the next 12 years at least isnt it safe to say this stock will continue a popular presence keeping nvdy in a healthy position

2024-08-25,06:21:02,dividends,TSLA,Tesla,living off cc etf real life experiment hi i personally dont see many people doing post about portfolio in a drawdown phrase most seems to be in an accumulation phrase so i thought id make one its my first time making post like this so please feel free to critique or advise me on what you would like to know or see im in canada so the ticker is going to be a bit different unfortunately i dont have access to low fee etf options with out incurring some withholding taxes but i tried to be as efficient as possible heres the portfolio stockevent doesnt work too well with margin so i use excel for full summary dividend summary from stockevent app the general strategy on this portfolio are broken down to 3 parts 1 core holding this portfolio is mainly in a tax advantage account this account will focus more on longer term outlook all the distribution will be funnel in to a passive index such as vfv sp500 or xqq nasdaq the distribution in an extreme emergency can be used for living expense the plan here is that if imagine starting at 0 and invest the amount provided by this account for 30 years with 6 real return the portfolio should be worth 15m and we can just live off that if all else fails 2 margin fixed income this portfolio is in my margin account i made a plunge in q3 last year to purchased a lot of preferred shares at the peak or what i thought was the peak of interest rates my assumption is that ps should move similar to bond and peak interest rates should somewhat indicate bottom of these ps prices as interest decrease or even just an market sentiment of rate decreasing should gradually move these shares price up also as rate decrease margin rate should also follow suit as the distribution is more secured than common shares dividends i felt a bit more comfortable going in with some margin the distribution for this portfolio is mainly used for paying down margin but can be used as a living expense if needed why brookfield i specifically picked up mostly bpo which is property side of brookfield this includes a lot of offices building related assets which i feel was priced down unreasonably at the time with market believing that wfh is here to stay these ps at the time was trading at 40 of issued price yielding over 1215 at the time majority of them are rate resets type the margin should be paid down in around 45 years however as the rate bottomed out or the shares prices are close to issued price i may off load these to pay down margin and redistributed to equity based funds 3 living expense this portfolio is mainly focused on broader market covered call etf mainly sp500 and nasdaq with an exception of ytsl which only hold tesla all the distribution from this portfolio is going toward living expense anything saved will be moved to emergency cash pile to later be reinvest or spend accordingly so imagine the whole portfolio distribution to be like your work income 25 of the income core is going toward saving for the future 25 margin going toward paying down debt which is margin and 50 living is going toward living expense i also have 612 months emergency funds in the case that market tanked hard we will switch to living off these while reinvest the distribution as economic uncertainty is looming and im just taking a plunge into this for the first time the first few months we might be extra careful with spending and see where to go from then potential risk aside from concentration risk in brookfield tesla and nvdia that can add volatility the other area of risk i can see is that im extracting 12 of distribution entirely from le portfolio this could proved shaky in the long term my vision here is that in a year or 2 as rate decreases i can off load preferred shares portion and move it to equity which will help pad the le portfolio and bring down the spend rate on le portfolio the worst worst case scenario that im not fully prepared for would be the event where simultaneously market crashed and brookfield also get massive hit to the point where liquidation is in question where bonds and ps are priced down significantly i then get margin called and liquidated currently me and my partner are burned out from our work we have no other income sources so we are living off this portfolio and plan to be for a long while generally we do not have lavish life style so our projected expense should be covered by the le portion of the portfolio but if extra expense comes up we can drawdown the cash pile or from margin portfolio ive been a long time lurker in this sub and i thought id document my journey thanks for reading feel free to chime in and let me know what you think
2024-08-23,22:25:12,dividends,NVDA,NVIDIA,just hit the 20k mark see yall at 25k i started trading in 2016 putting in 20 a month throughout college once i got my first job it turned into 100 a month once i was settled in my career it was 500 a month but now with student loans coming back im back to 200 a month of contribution slowly but surely doesnt hurt to have nvda make up 50 of my gains
2024-08-23,05:12:40,dividends,TSLA,Tesla,are these solid drip stocks about 3 years ago i had a business mentor of mine school me on drips he told me he has used computershare for years and the money gets auto debited monthly he said its important to atleast just get something going and you can always increase the monthly purchase i started with 50month in lowes mcdonalds jpm and recently started tesla even though thats the only one without dividends ive slowly increased the monthly contributions to 175month for lowes and 75 for jpm and mcd these picks were solely on the recommendation of this said mentor im inclined to keep raising the lowes and jpm contributions simply because i feel like they are healthy and long lasting companies my question is will this strategy pay off this friend told me it is a long term play and to set it and forget it but how long until you start to see some real gains with drips i currently have roughly 10 shares of lowes as my biggest holding are these low ceiling stocks any input is appreciated

2024-12-31,10:19:32,cryptocurrency,AAPL,Apple,trying to create a crypto wallet for india im a part of a startup we are trying to create a crypto wallet thats as user friendly and useful as traditional digital wallets phone pe pay tm apple pay we want people that have bitcoin etherium or other currencies to be able to directly pay to any vendor of their choice in the local currency we would be facilitating this through our own block chain the idea create a blockchain which is tethered to the indian currency rupees would have to be deposited to acquire these coins it builds our rupee reserves which means when people try to pay with the coins to regular vendors the money from our actual reserves would be used to pay for it it would enable safe and quick transactions that would also mean the vendors dont require the same app now the people whom who own bitcoin etc can easily convert it to our blockchain currency as we will build the block chain with interoperability and use it that way or we have an option where they can choose to pay with bitcoin since ours is a wallet they can transfer bitcoin to our wallet when they choose to pay with bitcoin again rupees will be used from our reserves for the transfer accounting for the gas fees well also recommend higher ammounts the bitcoins will be transfered to our bitcoin reserve etc my question to you all is a will this be useful for people in india who hold cryptocurrency b what are the drawbacks of this idea c possible legal troubles or roadblocks from indian government d development side issues is interoperability with a new blockchain difficult if so why and what issues we might face we are trying to use the cosmos sdk for this it claims to have inbuilt interoperability in the framework yes there are competitors and its a proven business zapit is a startup that made such seamless transactions possible we wanna do the same and maybe twist it a bit and do better

2024-12-22,03:56:22,cryptocurrency,TSLA,Tesla,would you buy a stock that never pays dividends a lot of people love to point out the bitcoin is hard to value because it doesnt have any dividends like stocks but plenty of stocks never pay dividends either look at amazon and tesla and theyre doing fine price keeps going up and people are happy to pay more and more for them as crypto fans often point out however and heres the big difference amazon and tesla will eventually pay dividends microsoft waited 28 years before they started paying dividends google waited 26 years starting dividends this year apple went fairly early just ten years though they had a pause for a while those stocks all had great capital growth long before they paid dividends but ultimately its the prospect of dividends that drive that price growth even if its a long wait after all you acquire a stock to claim a stake in the profits if a growth stock like google had a bylaw in its corporate constitution that explicitly stated it could never ever pay a dividend would you still buy it would anyone else what does that say about the longterm prospects of bitcoin

2024-12-19,01:46:59,cryptocurrency,NVDA,NVIDIA,crypto starting to move with the market ive noticed that crypto has been starting to follow the market more and more since the bitcoin and eth etfs launched is crypto becoming just another stock option essentially also can anyone get rich quick off of bitcoin or eth anymore you can buy bitcoin at 105k and if it goes to 1 mil 20 years or ever from now u 10x ur money but some stocks will match or beat that pretty easily especially since stocks are unique to current conditions and product demand ai and nvda for example where as crypto is crypto its controlled by whales who u dont know the next move or have insight other than prior historical trends stocks obviously can have similar movements but can also be predicted with enough research and analysis i think bitcoin is just not worth the price anymore its all hype and may continue its run higher but dont be surprised if it drops to 30k again or lower and stocks would never do that without multiple indicators imo

2024-12-10,23:17:53,cryptocurrency,NVDA,NVIDIA,turns out quantum resistance was not a crypto narrative it is an all systems issue what to know so this can be properly addressed and avoid the panic summary of the problem at hand 1 there is not an immediate risk your bags are safe but changes are needed to keep it that way 2 the incoming risk is becoming more apparent the timelines are highly debated the google willow news sparked concerns of how fast that might occur the timing is no longer worth debating these advancements are going to continue to be published and people will demand safeguards 3 yes it affects all systems not just crypto hence not a crypto narrative 4 this incoming risk moved slow and it seemed it may never be a concern that has changed 5 thankfully there has been extensive work to create cryptography that can withstand the capabilities of quantum computing 6 no this isnt a super computer that runs everything exponentially faster instead it is capable of running certain algorithms exponentially faster this is why shor and potentially more advanced algos will be able to break todays encryption 7 no this is not about sha256 it is about rsa and ecdsa these are the digital signatures that allow you to authorize transactions with your wallet or private key updating these is not a simple fork it wont be backward compatible and may cause extensive downtime to transition 8 not all keys are exposed generally it is any that had an outgoing transaction or the satoshi era wallets that used a weaker form of encryption 9 there is a lot of exposure which would be a problem and the concern is that could escalate a massive selloff 10 the systems we think would be more likely targeted are already working on upgrading the ones that dont upgrade will become the targets 11 there will be cloud capabilities which would allow low level actors to break into wallets crypto does not have any way to prove if they were the rightful owners and of course we know people find ways to move the funds through mixers this makes it a very vulnerable target tldr there no longer are solid arguments for not working on a solution this is not doomsday it requires thoughtful solutions and making the tough choices to move forward why this often appears to be a crypto narrative 1 quantum was developing slowly and it wasnt clear this would ever become an issue so it was dismissed as fud and perhaps rightly so 2 the misinformation around the issue at hand also gave people plenty of reasons to ignore it most are addressed above but im sure there will be more raised to debate but it becomes very hard to convince the masses that anon knows it isnt an issue when google nvidia ibm aws nist and all governments are talking about it even elon tweeted he is hearing it looks promising 3 saylor dismisses it at every opportunity using many of the above arguments those no longer are going to satisfy people it will be far more effective to start talking about the ways we anticipate solving the issue and acknowledging the challenges transparently otherwise it looks like the issue is being ignored or hidden 4 the crypto projects that have worked hard on this obviously have community members that have been pushing this risk for a while turns out they had valid arguments but were seemingly premature until now as described above this doesnt necessarily mean those projects win and the others lose 5 it does mean well prepared projects wont have hard decisions to make and can continue to focus on their use cases while others begin the extensive analysis and work required certainly that will create opportunities for growth as some projects will likely struggle to properly upgrade

2024-11-30,07:57:06,cryptocurrency,AAPL,Apple,what needs to happen for crypto to become mainstream and a currency used more frequent hear me out this is not an anti crypto or bitcoin post but this is a post regarding the complexity of bitcoin and storage for the average or novice crypto holdertrader will how bitcoin is stored and or traded ever become easier so that the mainstream average person or older people can buytradehold bitcoin now when you read this you are coming from an advanced or better understanding of crypto than me or the average person i have bought and or held crypto since 2016ish i know little about cold wallets and i am just now setting up a trezor for my kids so that i can pass on btc to them for part of their inheritance i believe like most of you that the value will increase thats not the point of this discussion what needs to happen or will happen so bitcoin is more adaptable or usable for the average person ask any of your friends and i bet 50 or higher dont have a clue about what blockchain even is then ask them about cold storage for their crypto if bitcoin is going to become mainstream and become a larger token used for currency it will have to become easier for the public to grasp and not get frustrated and give up trying to understand the complexity of what cryptobitcoin is and how to store it safely so it cant be hacked you reading this and being familiar with how everything i have mentioned works this might seem like a stretch but if your grandparents or joe blow is going to use crypto it will have to become much easier to grasp and store it safely just setting up my wallet there is seed phrases 1224 word passwords hidden wallets default wallets seed words i need to store and keep private to access my wallet and acct not a chance 50 of the elderly can safely invest a decent part of their retirement in crypto and store it safely without a lot of help and at best they will be confused about the set up and not follow through the more people involved in crypto the quicker it becomes mainstream and prices grow even higher just a quick glance on the internet and billions of crypto is still being hacked and stolen each year this is concerning to someone who is moving 67 figures in crypto to store in a wallet or cold storage i lost 13k in 2020 or so by having random coins i had to sell then convert to this token from that token to cash out in cash i sent coins from a wrong coin to another coin address and i was sol lost that money and even hired a crypto attorney to see if they could recover my funds apparently once it went into that coin or wallet by my own doing and accident there was no recovering them again thats not part of this discussion but the complexity of some trading could result is large losses the average retiree wont be willing to put 13 or 12 their retirement into a coin or system that they will need training and help setting up a wallet to store their funds my long winded post comes to the question what can or will have to happen for btc to become mainstream enough the average or novice investor feels safe enough to be able to buy in and place part of their retirement in crypto setting up phrases then passworkd phrases to get in your trezor that cant be stored online for fear of hacking will scare your average investor you reading this think this is foreign thinking because you have a basic or even advance understanding of crypto buying sending and storing even now as i am setting up a tree safe 5 i am a little concerned about what i can do online in regards to being connected to the internet and what can and cant be hacked so i store my words for my acct and trezor in a safe how do you safely store your words and info in the case you pass away and need to transfer your assets to your kids i dont think you want to store the words or passwords to your accts in your trust or will people have access to that i know there are stampings and metal plates you can store your passwords on but who and where do you trust to keep those your average 6080 year old who is retired or close to retiring wont feel safe putting 67 figures in a system that is this complex to learn for a novice i buy stocks i pass away my kids inherit my accts and they can keep or liquidate the stocks for liquid i pass away and give them a cold storage wallet with the passwords and how to access the btc thats a burden they now have to learn will crypto always be so complicated for those who dont spend time learning all the insouts of security buying microsoft or apple stock is simple enough i can go to cashapp and buy stocks ive been investing in stocks and various assets for 35 years ive never been so worried about am i doing this and that right not to lose or have my btc hacked will the system ever become easy and mainstream enough that a lot of this fear is removed i know debit cards are stolen and checking accts hacked money moved but your average person isnt near as worried about that as they are losing their crypto i read between 617 of adults own crypto that number needs to skyrocket to become mainstream look at the prices now think of 506080 of adults who own crypto what that would do to the price for crypto to become a mainstream form of currency a lot of this fear and difficulty needs to be removed some of you reading this since you understand this will think this post is over the top i assure you if you ask 50 people most of them have 2 concerns how to buy and send and how to store it safely until that fear eases will crypto ever reach the price predictions some say if the average person cant buy trade and store crypto without these worries again i own crypto will buy crypto will store it to pass to my kids one day but i feel the complexity of how to do this reamains one of the sticking points to what needs to become easier so the price reaches insane highs while removing the doubt of will i lose my crypto any thoughts if or how crypto becomes easier for the average joe or retiree to buy and store becomes easier sorry for the long winded post but i hope you get the jist of the post edit to post just to add to the complexity i just ordered a tezor safe 5 and i had to cancel the order i dont own a computer only an iphone and ipad i trade 7 figures worth of stocks and options a week off an ipad but cant run a cold wallet from an ipad this has to become easier and more mainstream i can log in my bank acct with my ipad transfer or wire 6 figures to my investing acct trade stocks sell stocks wire the money back to my bank acct buy bitcoin on cashapp and coinbase on my ipad but not use it for cold storage head scratching

2024-10-17,21:36:23,cryptocurrency,AAPL,Apple,lost 16m from fake rabby wallet in app store at least 16m stolen from a wallet drainer in apples app store cointelegraph reports yesterday cointelegraph doxxed a web3 hacker for his role in the fake rabby_io wallets that made it into the app store before the real one earlier this year konstantin pylinskiy aka konpyl ceo of moonward capital is the person held responsible according to the cointelegraph article this is the first instance i can recall of a major media company doxxing a hacker with a very detailed analysis of the theft the widely reported scam took place on feb 16th 2024 but im showing based on victim reports it happened first on dec 23rd 2023 and possibly as early as oct 2023 a twitter post from a user scammed by the fake rabby wallet on dec 23rd 2023 i came across a few support threads related to the fake rabby wallets uploaded one being here on reddit the other on a forum on apples own website additionally when the hack initially happened most media outlets reported the theft in the mid six figures the article by cointelegraph mentions the amount at over 16 million lost a full accounting is needed to get the true number how the fake rabby wallet scam happened to get past apples strict review process with a wallet drainer not once but at least twice maybe even three times is quite the feat if one of the most secure and trusted companies around can get scammed multiple time no one is safe in web3 the prevailing theory is the malicious developer of the fake rabby wallet applied to the ios app store under some generic fintech name the app itself would appear innocent enough to the reviewer once the app was approved the developer was able to change the name to rabby wallet crypto solution while inserting malicious code to turn that innocent little financial app into a vicious crypto drainer when debank announced the launch of the real rabby wallet in the app store the fake rabby wallet was already live while the real rabby wallet was still in apples approval process the accused bad actor konpyl was able to drain numerous unsuspecting victims who thought they were engaging with the real rabby wallet but instead got a fake one that targeted their crypto assets tracing the funds tracing the funds mentioned in the cointelegraph article between 0x4e9395cc1075b57016bf8b5bf8782bfef94c71c2 left image and 0x44bdb19db1cd29d546597af7dc0549e7f6f9e480 right image the flow of funds from the article can be extremely difficult to follow along at home but ill do my best a more detailed post about all of the wallets mentioned would make for a very lengthy analysis the research does look pretty spot on the main connection i see to konpyl is that wallet with his former opensea username 0x44bdb19db1cd29d546597af7dc0549e7f6f9e480 and the rhinofi output wallet of 0x4e9395cc1075b57016bf8b5bf8782bfef94c71c2 mentioned in the article i counted 6 txns worth almost 100k and found some shared deposit address activity between the two wallets as well its nearly impossible to get a true number of the total amount lost in the scam and wallets involved without a detailed analysis of the theft dates 16m lost could be a conservative number and the total victim account could be much higher apples role in the theft its wild to think malicious web3 applications can consistently make it into apples app store traditionally apple has had a hands off approach when it comes to these things the cointelegraph article mentions googles approach which appears to put in some effort to stop bad actors by publicity going after individuals who abuse google play i do think apple has an obligation to protect users from any and all threats that appear in the app store also due to the public nature of this theft im hopeful for some recovery for some of the victims

2024-09-29,16:13:12,cryptocurrency,AAPL,Apple,i think today the message needs to be yes unequivocally worry about this now have a plan a recent scott aaronson blog sums up why major businesses and governments are updating cryptography asap it also addresses the variety of outdated arguments pessimists are stuck on you can google scottaaronson blog 8329 as i cant seem to share the link here ill paste it below as well his quote im so used to delivering a message of maybe eventually someone will need to start thinking about migrating from rsa and diffiehellman and elliptic curve crypto to latticebased crypto or other systems that could plausibly withstand quantum attack i think today that message needs to change i think today the message needs to be yes unequivocally worry about this now have a plan ive also thought it is time for the existing coins to start designing and planning at a minimum its plainly obvious major companies like apple and google are already implementing changes so crypto should be at the forefront of this new era this will require major work and there will be impacts and tradeoffs that require consensus this is probably why there is such resistance to acknowledging this i fear we will be left with rushed solutions creating unnecessary disruption or worse vitalik at least considered an emergency plan but we should be demanding building testing of viable solutions ahead of an emergency it will be a full rewrite of how we digitally sign our transactions not backward compatible and likely require users to take actions such as transferring to wallets that are signing with the new cryptography if you are looking beyond the next 6 months for your portfolio youll need to start considering the impacts and which projects are genuinely prepared not just claims it will be easy to add in here is the pasted text of the blog quantum computing between hope and hype so back in june the white house announced that ucla would host a binational usindia workshop for national security officials from both countries to learn about the current status of quantum computing and postquantum cryptography it fell to my friend and colleague rafail ostrovsky to organize the workshop which ended up being held last week when rafi invited me to give the opening talk i knew hed keep emailing until i said yes so on the 3hour flight to lax i wrote the following talk in a spiral notebook which i then delivered the next morning with no slides i called it quantum computing between hope and hype i thought shtetloptimized readers might be interested too since it contains my reflections on a quartercentury in quantum computing and prognostications on what i expect soon enjoy and let me know what you think quantum computing between hope and hype by scott aaronson september 16 2024 when rafi invited me to open this event it sounded like he wanted bigpicture pontification more than technical results which is just as well since im getting old for the latter also im just now getting back into quantum computing after a twoyear leave at openai to think about the theoretical foundations of ai safety luckily for me that was a relaxing experience since not much happened in ai these past two years pause for laughs so then did anything happen in quantum computing while i was away this of course has been an extraordinary time for both quantum computing and ai and not only because the two fields were mentioned for the first time in an american presidential debate along with i think the problem of immigrants eating pets but its extraordinary for quantum computing and for ai in very different ways in ai practice is wildly ahead of theory and theres a race for scientific understanding to catch up to where weve gotten via the pure scaling of neural nets and the compute and data used to train them in quantum computing its just the opposite theres right now a race for practice to catch up to where theory has been since the mid1990s i started in quantum computing around 1998 which is not quite as long as some people here but which does cover most of the time since shors algorithm and the rest were discovered so i can say this past year or two is the first time ive felt like the race to build a scalable faulttolerant quantum computer is actually underway like people are no longer merely giving talks about the race or warming up for the race but running the race within just the last few weeks we saw the group at google announce that theyd used the kitaev surface code with distance 7 to encode one logical qubit using 100 or so physical qubits in superconducting architecture they got a net gain their logical qubit stays alive for maybe twice as long as the underlying physical qubits do and crucially they find that their logical coherence time increases as they pass to larger codes with higher distance on more physical qubits with superconducting there are still limits to how many physical qubits you can stuff onto a chip and eventually youll need communication of qubits between chips which has yet to be demonstrated but if you could scale googles current experiment even to 1500 physical qubits youd probably be below the threshold where you could use that as a building block for a future scalable faulttolerant device then just last week a collaboration between microsoft and quantinuum announced that in the trappedion architecture they applied pretty substantial circuits to logicallyencoded qubitsagain in a way that gets a net gain in fidelity over not doing errorcorrection modulo a debate about whether theyre relying too much on postselection so they made a ghz state which is basically like a schrödinger cat out of 12 logically encoded qubits they also did a quantum chemistry simulation which had only two logical qubits but which required three logical nonclifford gateswhich is the hard kind of gate when youre doing errorcorrection because of these advances as well as otherswhat quera is doing with neutral atoms what psiquantum and xanadu are doing with photonics etcim now more optimistic than ive ever been that if things continue at the current rate either there are useful faulttolerant qcs in the next decade or else something surprising happens to stop that plausibly well get there not just with one hardware architecture but with multiple ones much like the manhattan project got a uranium bomb and a plutonium bomb around the same time so the question will become which one is most economic if someone asks me why im now so optimistic the core of the argument is 2qubit gate fidelities weve known for years that at least on paper quantum faulttolerance becomes a net win that is you sustainably correct errors faster than you introduce new ones once you have physical 2qubit gates that are 9999 reliable the problem has merely been how far we were from that when i entered the field in the late 1990s it wouldve been like a science or nature paper to do a 2qubit gate with 50 fidelity but then at some point the 50 became 90 became 95 became 99 and within the past year multiple groups have reported 999 so if you just plot the log of the infidelity as a function of year and stare at ityeah youd feel pretty optimistic about the next decade too or pessimistic as the case may be to any of you who are worried about postquantum cryptographyby now im so used to delivering a message of maybe eventually someone will need to start thinking about migrating from rsa and diffiehellman and elliptic curve crypto to latticebased crypto or other systems that could plausibly withstand quantum attack i think today that message needs to change i think today the message needs to be yes unequivocally worry about this now have a plan so i think this moment is a good one for reflection were used to quantum computing having this air of unreality about it like sure we go to conferences we prove theorems about these complexity classes like bqp and qma the experimenters do little toy demos that dont scale but if this will ever be practical at all then for all we know not for another 200 years it feels really different to think of this as something plausibly imminent so what i want to do for the rest of this talk is to step back and ask what are the main reasons why people regarded this as not entirely real and what can we say about those reasons in light of where we are today reason 1 for the general public maybe the overriding reason not to take qc seriously has just been that it sounded too good to be true like great youll have this magic machine thats gonna exponentially speed up every problem in optimization and machine learning and finance by trying out every possible solution simultaneously in different parallel universes does it also dice peppers for this objection id say that our response hasnt changed at all in 30 years and its simply no thats not what it will do and not how it will work we should acknowledge that laypeople and journalists and unfortunately even some investors and government officials have been misled by the people whose job it was to explain this stuff to them i think its important to tell people that the only hope of getting a speedup from a qc is to exploit the way that qm works differently from classical probability theory in particular that it involves these numbers called amplitudes which can be positive negative or even complex with every quantum algorithm what youre trying to do is choreograph a pattern of interference where for each wrong answer the contributions to its amplitude cancel each other out whereas the contributions to the amplitude of the right answer reinforce each other the trouble is its only for a few practical problems that we know how to do that in a way that vastly outperforms the best known classical algorithms what are those problems here for all the theoretical progress thats been made in these past decades im going to give the same answer in 2024 that i wouldve given in 1998 namely theres the simulation of chemistry materials nuclear physics or anything else where manybody quantum effects matter this was feynmans original application from 1981 but probably still the most important one commercially it could plausibly help with batteries drugs solar cells hightemperature superconductors all kinds of other things maybe even in the next few years and then theres breaking publickey cryptography which is not commercially important but is important for other reasons wellknown to everyone here and then theres everything else for problems in optimization machine learning finance and so on theres typically a grovers speedup but that of course is only a square root and not an exponential which means that it will take much longer before its relevant in practice and one of the earliest things we learned in quantum computing theory is that theres no blackbox way to beat the grover speedup by the way thats also relevant to breaking cryptography other than the subset of cryptography thats based on abelian groups and can be broken by shors algorithm or the like the centerpiece of my phd thesis twenty years ago was the theorem that you cant get more than a grovertype polynomial speedup for the blackbox problem of finding collisions in cryptographic hash functions so then what remains well there are all sorts heuristic quantum algorithms for classical optimization and machine learning problems qaoa quantum approximate optimization algorithm quantum annealing and so on and we can hope that sometimes theyll beat the best classical heuristics for the same problems but it will be trench warfare not just magically speeding up everything there are lots of quantum algorithms somehow inspired by the hhl harrowhassidimlloyd algorithm for solving linear systems and we can hope that some of those algorithms will get exponential speedups for endtoend problems that matter as opposed to problems of transforming one quantum state to another quantum state we can of course hope that new quantum algorithms will be discovered and most of all we can look for entirely new problem domains where people hadnt even considered using quantum computers beforenew orchards in which to pick lowhanging fruit recently shihhan hung and i along with others have proposed using current qcs to generate cryptographically certified random numbers which could be used in poststate cryptocurrencies like ethereum im hopeful that people will find other protocol applications of qc like that one proof of quantum work another major potential protocol application which dan boneh brought up after my talk is quantum oneshot signatures anyway taken together i dont think any of this is too good to be true i think its genuinely good and probably true reason 2 a second reason people didnt take seriously that qc was actually going to happen was the general thesis of technological stagnation at least in the physical world you know maybe in the 40s and 50s humans built entirely new types of machines but nowadays what do we do we issue press releases we make promises we argue on social media nowadays of course pessimism about technological progress seems hard to square with the revolution thats happening in ai another field that spent decades being ridiculed for unfulfilled promises and thats now fulfilling the promises id also speculate that to the extent there is technological stagnation most of it is simply that its become really hard to build new infrastructurehighspeed rail nuclear power plants futuristic citiesfor legal reasons and nimby reasons and environmental review reasons and baumols cost disease reasons but none of that really applies to qc just like it hasnt applied so far to ai reason 3 a third reason people didnt take this seriously was the sense of its been 20 years already wheres my quantum computer qc is often compared to fusion power another technology thats eternally just over the horizon except im no expert but there seems to be dramatic progress these days in fusion power too my response to the people who make that complaint was always like how much do you know about the history of technology it took more than a century for heavierthanair flight to go from correct statements of the basic principle to reality universal programmable classical computers surely seemed more fantastical from the standpoint of 1920 than quantum computers seem today but then a few decades later they were built today ai provides a particularly dramatic example where ideas were proposed a long time agoneural nets backpropagationthose ideas were then written off as failures but no we now know that the ideas were perfectly sound it just took a few decades for the scaling of hardware to catch up to the ideas thats why this objection never had much purchase by me even before the dramatic advances in experimental quantum errorcorrection of the last year or two reason 4 a fourth reason why people didnt take qc seriously is that a century after the discovery of qm some people still harbor doubts about quantum mechanics itself either they explicitly doubt it like leonid levin roger penrose or gerard t hooft or they say things like complex hilbert space in 2n dimensions is a nice mathematical formalism but mathematical formalism is not realitythe kind of thing you say when you want to doubt but not take full intellectual responsibility for your doubts i think the only thing for us to say in response as quantum computing researchersand the thing i consistently have saidis man we welcome that confrontation lets test quantum mechanics in this new regime and if instead of building a qc we have to settle for merely overthrowing quantum mechanics and opening up a new era in physicswell then i guess well have to find some way to live with that reason 5 my final reason why people didnt take qc seriously is the only technical one ill discuss here namely maybe quantum mechanics is fine but faulttolerant quantum computing is fundamentally screened off or censored by decoherence or noiseand maybe the theory of quantum faulttolerance which seemed to indicate the opposite makes unjustified assumptions this has been the position of gil kalai for example the challenge for that position has always been to articulate what is true about the world instead can every realistic quantum system be simulated efficiently by a classical computer if so how what is a model of correlated noise that kills qc without also killing scalable classical computingwhich turns out to be a hard problem in any case i think this position has been dealt a severe blow by the random circuit sampling quantum supremacy experiments of the past five years scientifically the most important thing weve learned from these experiments is that the fidelity seems to decay exponentially with the number of qubits but only exponentially as it would if the errors were independent from one gate to the next precisely as the theory of quantum faulttolerance assumes so for anyone who believes this objection id say that the ball is now firmly in their court so if we accept that qc is on the threshold of becoming real what are the next steps there are the obvious ones push forward with building better hardware and using it to demonstrate logical qubits and faulttolerant operations on them continue developing better errorcorrection methods continue looking for new quantum algorithms and new problems for those algorithms to solve but theres also a less obvious decision right now namely do we put everything into faulttolerant qubits or do we continue trying to demonstrate quantum advantage in the nisq prefaulttolerant era theres a case to be made that faulttolerance will ultimately be needed for scaling and anything you do without faulttolerance is some variety of nonscalable circus trick so we might as well get over the hump now but id like to advocate putting at least some thought into how to demonstrate a quantum advantage in the nearterm thay could be via cryptographic protocols like those that kahanamokumeyer et al have proposed it could be via pseudorandom peaked quantum circuits a recent proposal by me and yuxuan zhangif we can figure out an efficient way to generate the circuits or we could try to demonstrate what william kretschmer harry buhrman and i have called quantum information supremacy where instead of computational advantage you try to do an experiment that directly shows the vastness of hilbert space via exponential advantages for quantum communication complexity for example im optimistic that that might be doable in the very near future and have been working with quantinuum to try to do it on the one hand when i started in quantum computing 25 years ago i reconciled myself to the prospect that im going to study what fundamental physics implies about the limits of computation and maybe ill never live to see any of it experimentally tested and thats fine on the other hand once you tell me that there is a serious prospect of testing it soon then i become kind of impatient some part of me says lets do this lets try to achieve forthwith what ive always regarded as the 1 application of quantum computers more important than codebreaking or even quantum simulation namely disproving the people who said that scalable quantum computing was impossible

2024-05-17,23:03:59,cryptocurrency,AAPL,Apple,deanonymization of the dero network sender receiver amounts and messages full thread just the technical writeup proof following challenge copy of the full technical writeup the dero protocol the protocol uses a pair of rings one for the senders one for the receivers represented as a singular ring with each transfer a list of elgamal ciphertexts is provided for all accounts within the joint ring this elgamal ciphertext is formed as r g r k a g where r is some randomness k is the key for the account the ciphertext is for and a is the amount the dero wallet protocol dero offers an encrypted message with every transaction even if the user does not explicitly provide one a message will exist either with internally provided values or left empty for the only defined type of message the message is encoded as the index of the sender a cborencoded object and zeropadding the message is encrypted with the chacha20 stream created by a key of hhr k k where r is some randomness and k is the key for the account the ciphertext is for the issue dero reuses the randomness for the elgamal ciphertexts and the message encryption this means if the amount is 0 the second part of the elgamal ciphertext is the shared key and the message can be decrypted also revealing the receiver as the elgamal ciphertext used is for a specific receiver if the amount isnt 0 one can subtract 1 g until the amount term has a 0 coefficient when the message does decrypt the amount of subtractions performed is the amount breaking amount privacy since the first byte of the message is the sender index this also reveals the sender in total this compromises sender amount receiver and message privacy technical notes since the encryption isnt authenticated as far as the author of this work can tell we cannot explicitly know if a decryption is valid or invalid practically we can the last 16 bytes of the message will be zeroes with very high statistical probability if the message doesnt fill those bytes and the decryption key is correct a random decryption key should produce random noise there instead if the message does fill those bytes then its a long stream of cbor for which its unlikely to be valid once further bounds are added dero encodes all keys with an additional byte for the type forcing said byte to be one of a few options and the corresponding value to be of that type while not a strict limitation all predefined keys are one letter potentialy practically offering the bound of keys being twobyte ascii though that assumes no callers defined their own keys which are either nonascii or longer than one letter with only the certain additional bounds a cbor object which takes up the entire space will match random noise approximately once out of every 240 trials itd be sane to flag cbor objects which look incorrect despite passing the trial and if so continue brute forcing the sanest result being the likely one with drastically increasing probability as it appears saner any result shorter than 129 bytes being effectively certain in summary the trial decryption algorithm is checking if the result is a valid sender index less than the ring length for one of the potential senders checking theres a valid cbor object _with the certain additional bounds_ and finally checking the remaining bytes are all zeroes distinctly since theres a lack of authentication other than setting the sender ring length to 1 its own issue in this context its presumed possible for a transactions sender to claim to be someone else impersonating them this is a distinct vulnerability in the messaging protocol at least as its being advertised for usage in place of existing encrypted messengers the byte intended for the sender index was historically mistakenly used for the receiver index this was only patched six months ago in accordingly sender privacy specifically was only broken for transactions made with wallet software updated to include the patch the amount does need to be brute forced dero amounts take 41 bits due to only using 5 decimals and a supply in the low tens of millions and with the maximum joint ring size of 128 leaving 64 receivers or 26 candidates takes 47 bits of effort at most which is quite feasible for computers due to most transactions having smaller than larger amounts most transactions can be cracked faster than the max time brute force and statistical analysis could be used to prioritize certain receivers reducing the average time for any algorithm which is even slightly more right than wrong because this is an attack on the wallet protocol it can decrypt any message as the message is part of the wallet protocol the recovery of the amount receiver and sender assume the transaction was made in accordance with the dero wallet protocol theoretically someone could have their own noncompliant dero wallet which either could not have its privacy broken or could provide false readings depending on if it was programmed to use distinct encryption keys in explicit preparation for a work such as this making this vulnerability prior discovered while no such wallets are known to the author of this to work and are extremely unlikely to exist that must be noted disclosure timeline this issue was found on may 14th with a proof of concept built the same day the proof of concept will be released in a week leaving those affected a bit of time to prepare though this post is detailed enough to enable independent development of such tools in practice it isnt optimized to the degree necessary to crack every single transaction on the network now as itd need to be rebuilt for gpus or potentially ideally fpgas yet suffices as a proof of concept dero offers a 50000 usd bug bounty for vulnerabilities which affect the financial integrity of the blockchain it includes no details on how to disclose bugs however the author anonymously reached out to the maintainer of the dero project captain dero over matrix to inquire if the bug bounty would still apply and to report their findings due to 1 not receiving a reply from the maintainer within two days a fair time to have the initial message acknowledged per the authors opinion and the opinion of a leading web3 security platform 2 contacting a developer successfully who said whatever youre looking at is likely a misunderstanding on your part with no context other than there being a critical privacy issue attempting to be disclosed who then said to submit a pr with my proposal despite it being a security disclosure and when emphasized the desire to privately disclose to the maintainer before going public being told the options were to go public or simply wait until the maintainer gets around to it when following up a day later to again attempt to cause a successful connection with the maintainer noting the lack thereof thus far then just disclose it no need to harass me over it 3 deciding users should be made aware as soon as possible so they no longer expect privacy for what would inevitably not have privacy the author decided to publish this without achieving successful communication with the maintainer while that does make these findings unconfirmed by the dero project the proof of concept establishes the theory works moving forward if such a vulnerability was found in signal the author of this work would not be able to decrypt all sent messages on the network as they would not have access by placing messages on a highly replicated ledger its trivial for any adversary to obtain the ciphertexts of any message ever sent this means a wallet compromised years after use can still have all its messages read and since dero doesnt use a postquantum key exchange any adversary with a discrete log oracle such as one with a quantum computer would eventually be able to decrypt all messages highly replicated ledgers should not be used for storage of extremely sensitive information in general even if encrypted if such a ledger is used regardless it should be in a forwardsecret manner with only a bounded subset of messages being readable on compromise the immediate fix for this specific issue is to use distinct randomness for the message encryption key that alone does not fix the variety of issues with this design when posited as a secure messaging protocol for context on the difficulty of secure messaging protocols please see a 94page analysis of signal signals postquantum protocol the simplex documentation and specifications which argues themselves a notable improvement upon signal and imessages extensive work on contact key verification this is an extensive field of theory for a reason the dero wallet protocol has largely been undocumented and without peer review its proofs for a transfer use a bulletproofs innerproduct at the end yet the higherlevel constructions arent documented other than one or two incredibly vague comments such as how theyre forming oneoutofmany proofs which are an explicit thing and its not contested that the intent of these proofs is to implement one the question is which it intends to implement hopefully the dero developers start formalizing their protocol and develop better relations with the wider cryptographic community as to cause peer review and help prevent issues such as this in the future to the members of the dero community and people in general the recommendation is to only use secure messengers which have a peerreviewed protocol and foss clients such as signal with molly being the leading foss client this same line of reasoning also applies to privacy protocols in general including those which apply to financial transactions for a private verifiable protocol for financial transactions please see monero or zcash orchard the latter achieves stronger privacy in theory yet has only been deployed on a network which doesnt require all transactions be private finally the dero community frequently has very grandiose marketing which claims their technology the best while its understandable for fans of a project to believe their project is the best every project has hard limits with this effective fullloss of privacy except for sender privacy on transactions made by wallet software older than 6 months may they hopefully acknowledge no one is perfect and especially not dero

2024-05-14,15:58:48,cryptocurrency,AAPL,Apple,99 crypto projects are all about marketing and money making people invested in crypto are only seeing through their hopes point of view so let me tell you how is their point of view if you dont know this and youre not in on it then youre the victim let me explain most crypto projects have founders which mostly start the project sometimes with as little as just an idea they create the token which they explain its purpose to exist called tokenomics then the real work and strategy begins marketing as long as you know the right people on ct or vcs you can have an easy time marketing your project nothing like a good old token distribution plan to compensate people shilling their token thus more insiders for the team which are now all interested in making the price of the token rise after the token distribution and prob some buying to make the price look like its starting to rise the shilling commences backed by marketing people on twitter see wizz kaduna etc shilling the token and they buy it after that people need to buy from easier places like exchanges exchange pressure commences followed by another token distribution to xyz exchanges interested to get in on the action a bit more marketing and you starting to see adds on twitter articles etc now that theres nice liquidity on the exchanges the real game commences the dump so now that your token is trending and you get nice fat bags you start selling more getting those millions stacked you continue with the marketing strategy for the liquidity required for the insiders to exit pay a little more to cts to pump up the hype articles talking about it price targets supposed partnerships with apple or google whatnot once the price starts to dump you reduce the marketing but still making the hopes up for the little fish invested in it and you continue to sell as much as you can if you see kaduna others still giving hopes up about his shill even tho the price is dumping hes probably not in on it he was paid to give hopes not hold the token now youre rich what now now heres tree options revive the token with your liquidity and start the marketing engine again with the promisse of reaching ath again or you start a new project all over again but now you have more liquidity eaier time or you go live life at its fullest theres a very little percentage of people who made tremendous amounts of money from these schemes and most of them were insiders who knew the game not regular degen investors if you still have hope for crypto projects pick those who can emmulate bitcoin ethereum path

2024-04-16,15:54:46,cryptocurrency,TSLA,Tesla,6 reasons bitcoin will hit 200k after the halving as bitcoin approaches its fourth halving in april anticipation mounts regarding its trajectory postevent with predictions ranging from 38 million per bitcoin cathie woods of ark investment to being worthless jamie dimon of jp morgan the whole community is engaged in the event with the halving set to reduce bitcoins mining rewards to 3125 btc per block a critical shift is occurring in its economic landscape further flattening its supply curve and accelerating the transition from an inflationary to a deflationary asset as time goes by and the scarcity of each bitcoin increases natural economic forces will act to push prices upwards in response to increasing demand amidst a macroeconomic cultural shift traditional investments like real estate once favoured by baby boomers are losing appeal among millennials and gen zers instead the new generations are increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies as an alternative investment they are drawn by the perceived advantages of greater flexibility lower barriers to entry and potentially higher returns in the following sections we dive deep into the pivotal factors we think will fuel bitcoins meteoric rise post halving reason 1 increased confidence from a code perspective the protocol adjustment that will occur on block 840000 is a relatively minor event in prior halvings scepticism towards the technology and its reliability were constantly questioned each halving event is psychologically associated with a proven track record that yet again bitcoin will execute against its intended purpose promised in the original whitepaper back in 2008 as an asset class bitcoin is still in its infancy and halvings bring a boost of confidence to outside observers and those not yet invested reason 2 slowing inflation drives value the first lesson in economics is one of supply and demand with a reduced supply and a constant or increasing demand prices will rise in all markets bitcoin is no different in this respect its supply is designed to reduce over time and with bitcoins constantly being lost this is the nature of all currencies the only direction for the price to head is upwards reason 3 hype and network effects source bitnodes global bitcoin nodes map halving events draw substantial media attention with the community actively driving discussions across various platforms the heightened visibility contributes to a surge in market speculation fueled by increased liquidity consequently the combination of widespread awareness and heightened trading activity propels bitcoins price upward source defidive realtime bitcoin news page the oxford english dictionary defines a network effect as a phenomenon whereby a product or service gains additional value as more people use it everyday examples of network effects are found on messaging platforms such as whatsapp or telegram social media platforms such as instagram or tiktok and online marketplaces such as airbnb or ebay its not hard to see that in these examples the greater the user base the better the experience as a positive feedback loop ensures that an increasing user base encourages and attracts more participants with bitcoin as its ecosystem matures its utility and value proposition increases with each independent actor whether private holder institutional investor or state actors begin to increase their own holdings in the cryptocurrency reason 4 easier access demand for bitcoin has never been higher and access to bitcoin through exchanges wallet service providers and now regulated financial instruments such as the bitcoin etfs has never been easier with institutional capital now able to access bitcoin through their brokers more companies will have the ability to park cash assets into crypto assets providing further shareholder value as we have seen with michael saylors microstrategy and elon musks tesla both choosing to park profits aside in the cryptocurrency reason 5 a hedge against economic uncertainty increasing government debt over time has led to a landscape of economic instability characterized by cyclical periods of boom and busts occurring every 810 years amidst the macroeconomic uncertainty currency devaluations are deemed an important tool establishing a gloomy backdrop in this environment bitcoin is emerging as a prime hedge against uncertainty offering an attractive alternative against the concerns of the current financial system reason 6 historical price 1 year comparisons lets look at the history of bitcoins price during the halving first halving happened on november 28 2012 btc 1254 price on november 28 2013 btc 1050 percentage increase 8650 source tradingview second halving happened on july 9 2016 64069 price on july 9 2017 2565 percentage increase 301 source tradingview third halving happened on 11th may 2020 880539 price on 11th may 2021 5641395 percentage increase 540 source tradingview this historical growth suggests that bitcoin has the potential for significant posthalving growth further fuelling expectations of a 200k price tag conclusion while historical trends cannot predict future performance bitcoins past shows us remarkable price surges following halving events at defidive our team have traded bitcoin since 2011 and strongly hold a belief that this time will be no different in a past blog post we set a target price of 92000 per bitcoin this year we adjust our target to a 2024 top of 200000 per bitcoin the price charts show bitcoins gains in the past have been influenced heavily by huge demand which in 2024 is much more significant than ever before this moment will signify the first halving since bitcoin became a regulated asset class instead of us bitcoiners having to constantly answer why we hold bitcoin were now finally entering an era of why dont you hold bitcoin what is your 1 year price target and why
2024-04-13,14:47:48,cryptocurrency,AAPL,Apple,european commission advocates for a united shift to quantumresistant cryptography about a month ago vitalik noted his plan in case of a quantum computing emergency and apple released news of implementing post quantum encryption this week the european commission is raising the issue similar to what the united states did over a year ago these events are raising the tough questions about when and how will systems implement digital signing with encryption that can withstand quantum computing this is something all systems will need to do until now the topic has been largely ignored there are solutions that can be implemented and while it is assumed there are more lucrative targets than crypto we may find that crypto is the least risky target and may be the last prepared note that the blockchain history of most major coins appears to be fine it really is the issue of signing and protecting your private keys where the weakness is and why it is a bit tricky to upgrade that in a way that limits disruption for users and the ecosystems below are some projects that have planned developed andor prepared for quantum computing their focus is much more than just being prepared for quantum resistance however they will benefit from this topic coming into focus since they have planned for quantum resistance all along in the end all chains and systems will need to prepare the question will be how well projects navigate this being prepared from the beginning offers obvious advantages algo it appears to have added falcon as quantum resistance for consensus purposes but i havent seen if they have a solution defined for digital signature which is the primary issue requiring quantum resistance this is a long standing layer1 i saw a recent post it is at its atl against btc could be worth a look if it gains momentum cell had a nice runup early in the year but now over 50 pullback cell follows more of a dot type design not sure the reason for such a large pullback as this happened well before the market pullback yesterday xx ame xep hbar and a few others i know less about have been mentioned for preparing i dont have details to add here but worth researching qrl built for qr years ago has put a lot of research into the topic biggest issue has been availability to buy we saw once it was available on mexc it made a nice run still working to add in evm compatibility and smart contracts which would put it in a much better position for adoption and to be available on swaps seems to be holding its new level even with market pullback qanx had a nice run with news ethereum board member patrick storchenegger is now ceo of qans intellectual property ip holding company and has partnered with an eu country to use their qr tech stack testnet due this month which should initiate marketing plans eth like design pos with evm compatible smart contracts in any programming language did have a 25 dip with this market pullback

2024-04-07,03:58:27,cryptocurrency,NVDA,NVIDIA,how does one dyoridk if this is the correct flair im new to crypto so i take any input i can get i see on several platforms that there are ai crypto currencies that will leave the profits made by the likes of bitcoin and nvidia in the dust but they never name it and say that to obtain its name youll have to buy our membership or some other kind of transaction now i dont wanna pay these people because it feels like a scam but many of these platforms say the same thing so i think there must be some truth in it ive asked people online that have the memberships but all they say is that it isnt worth it and you should do your own research this begs the question how
2024-04-04,22:34:26,cryptocurrency,TSLA,Tesla,rising and falling the bitcoin story as we zoom in on the intricate details of this bitcoin chart were essentially time traveling through the life story of a revolutionary currency this isnt just a tale of wild price swings its a deep dive into how bitcoin has weaved itself into the fabric of global finance weve seen it grow from a digital seedling into a towering tree in the financial forest its roots spreading far and wide our story begins when bitcoin was just whispers in cyberspace valued at mere cents its akin to finding an old treasure map leading to a chest thats now worth billions then 2013 hit and bitcoin grabbed the worlds attention not all for good reasons mind you with the silk road and mt gox putting it through its paces those were testing times but bitcoin showed its mettle bouncing back each time marching down the timeline we encounter pivotal moments like when germany gave bitcoin a regulatory nod the halving events that sharpen bitcoins scarcity edge and the growing wave of institutional investments each of these milestones is like a stepping stone that bitcoin used to cross the river of uncertainty inching closer to the mainstream shore fastforward to 2017 and we find bitcoin riding a wave of enthusiasm propelled by a flood of icos its a dizzying climb with a peak that had everyone talking but then as the adage goes what goes up must come down and 2018 brought the sobering chill of the crypto winter this was the markets way of saying take a breath reassess and plan your next move in 2021 bitcoin came back with a vengeance reaching dizzying new heights this wasnt just about investors jumping on a bandwagon it was about big players from corporations to hedge funds recognizing bitcoins potential but then the tides turned in 2022 as macroeconomic pressures from inflation concerns to tightening monetary policy caused the market to shiver and shake off some of its gains and just when we thought we had seen it all the bitcoin saga continued into 2022 and 2023 years that would test the mettle of investors and the resilience of the crypto ecosystem the narrative took a dramatic turn as the market faced the headwinds of change inflation was no longer a specter looming on the horizon it became a stark reality sending central banks into a frenzy of monetary tightening the ripples of this new economic stance were felt throughout the bitcoin market sending shivers down the spine of the crypto world and triggering a selloff that would see bitcoin shed a significant portion of its value but even as the value wavered the technology didnt stand still innovations within the blockchain space continued with improvements to scalability and security not to mention the everexpanding universe of decentralized finance defi and nonfungible tokens nfts skepticism was still a frequent guest at the table but for every doubter there was an innovator pushing the boundaries of what crypto could be as we turned the page to 2024 the crypto community was holding its breath in anticipation would this be the year of recovery the year when bitcoin would defy the odds and rebound or would it be another year of challenges and characterbuilding for the worlds premier cryptocurrency the introduction of more sophisticated regulatory frameworks began to pave a clearer path for institutional adoption and whispers of the next halving event started to stir the markets imagination bitcoins dance with mainstream finance became more intricate there were stumbles sure but every step was a lesson learned the chart became not just a reflection of past price movements but a ledger of bitcoins ongoing maturationa digital asset growing up in a world still grappling with its implications behind the scenes this chart captures the tugofwar between innovation and skepticism for instance the social media giants with their advertising clampdown had bitcoin on the ropes for a bit yet each technological milestone each regulatory hurdle crossed has added to bitcoins credibility then we have the environmental subplot where teslas dance with bitcoin highlighted the growing pains of an industry grappling with sustainability its like watching a fledgling industry mature grappling with its identity and its impact on the planet why are we sharing this story in all its technicolor detail because its about more than just investment and market speculation its a historical document for future market historians a lesson book for current investors and a crystal ball for those trying to catch a glimpse of the future this chart is a saga of resilience bursting with tales of technical revolutions economic shakeups regulatory cliffhangers and the tireless human spirit driving it all its the chronicle of an underdog thats fighting for its place in the financial hall of fame but wait theres more this isnt just about recounting past glories and missteps its about sketching out the forces that may shape bitcoins journey ahead its about seeing the patterns the peaks the troughs and gearing up for the next chapter in this blockbuster saga in wrapping up this lengthy winding narrative we come back to where we are now bitcoin standing tall amidst the shifting sands of finance and technology this chart isnt just a snapshot its a living breathing tale of an asset thats as enigmatic as it is exciting its about understanding the past to navigate the futures uncertain waters so heres to bitcoin the digital enigma the currency of tomorrow and heres to the unwritten chapters that well be charting next
2024-04-03,11:47:46,cryptocurrency,TSLA,Tesla,reasons why some believe elon musk could be satoshi nakamoto and doge could have a big part after my previous post sparked debate i want to focus on more reasons supporting the theory that elon musk could be satoshi nakamoto and ðoge could in return have something to do with it 1 background in computer science and technology elon musks early ventures such as zip2 and xcom demonstrate his technical expertise relevant to bitcoins development 2 interest in cryptography musks involvement in encryption and security through projects like x spacex and tesla highlights his knowledge in cryptography a key aspect of bitcoin 3 early interest in digital payments musks role in the founding of xcom and paypal shows his early recognition of the potential of digital payments and cryptocurrencies 4 programming language and code similarities bitcoins code is written in c a programming language known for its efficiency and versatility elon musks ventures including spacex and tesla also utilize c in their software development highlighting a shared technical preference 5 similar text style both elon musk and satoshi nakamoto have a distinctive and often cryptic writing style their communication is concise technical and direct 6 advocacy for transparency openness and global perspective elon musk has been a vocal advocate for transparency and open communication which are also principles valued by the bitcoin community his support for open source technology and collaboration aligns with the ethos of bitcoins open development process similarly his companies including x twitter also emphasize openness and transparency in their operations and communication reflecting a shared commitment to these principles across his ventures additionally both elon musk and the bitcoin community have a global perspective aiming to create solutions that benefit people worldwide and transcend geographical boundaries 7 timely involvement with ðogecoin elon musks notable involvement with ðogecoin particularly his tweets and endorsements coincided with significant events in the cryptocurrency world his support for ðogecoin leading up to the bitcoin halving and the date 420 known as dogeday in the community suggests a strategic and timely interest in the crypto space this timing has led some to speculate about a potential connection between elon musk and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem including bitcoin 8 potential role of ðogecoin if elon musk were satoshi nakamoto ðogecoin could play a significant role in promoting generosity and doing good a coin that strives for doing only good everyday could encourage a more positive and generous world its worth noting that my previous post received a lot of hate which raises questions about the negativity some people harbor towards innovative ideas and possibilities the strong negative reactions emphasize the need for a more welcoming and positive cryptocurrency community making ðogecoins ethos of kindness and generosity even more relevant and necessary
2024-04-02,01:46:29,cryptocurrency,AAPL,Apple,having trouble swapping crypto back into ethereum help and advice appreciated im not new to investing or trading ive held stocks and cryptocurrencies for years on platforms etrade robinhood coinbase etc im no expert when it comes to trading but i atleast have basic knowledge of how spreads volume options after hours etc works however ive recently begun exploring very high risk high reward investing ideas specifically looking into alternate cryptocurrencies im still in the learning process of how it all works what a wallet is network fees blockchains swapping etc so forgive me if my current situation which im about to explain sounds ignorant and dumb heres where im at i wanted to buy a specific crypto lets call it xyz coin that has a market cap of around 200 million i realized the process to buy this would be more complicated than the process of buying a blue chip stock like apple or a major cryptocurrency like ethereum so heres what i did i created a coinbase account and set up my coinbase wallet as well i transferred about 1 full ethereum from robinhood to coinbase then i transferred that same ethereum from coinbase to coinbase walleti have the app after that i swapped around 01 ethereum to xyz coins just as kind of a test to make sure everything was working properly so far so good the problem is if i try to swap xyz coins back into ethereum it says this transaction will likely fail if it does youll lose the network fee in attempts to solve this ive tried the following changing the amount im sending ive explored ranges from 10 to 400 changing the slippage tolerance ive bumped it as high as 50 without success not swapping but sending it back to my ethereum wallet what this did was convert xyz to xyz rather than xyz to etheruem which i had hoped yes i have much to learn about this stuff lol so to conclude what is the real issue here i understand that most of these coins are scams so is my investment just lost should i buy these kinds of coins using a different method i figured the size and volume of this xyz coin would mean there wouldnt be issues with not having enough buyers and sellers to make trades am i wrong about that any helpadvice is greatly appreciated

2024-03-22,10:29:30,cryptocurrency,NVDA,NVIDIA,ama announcement unveiling the future of decentralized ai and software development with tau net agrs march 25th 6pm utc 1500 usdt giveaway greetings rcryptocurrency community were thrilled to announce that the tau net team will be hosting an ama session right here on march 25th at 6pm utc this is your chance to dive deep into the innovative world of tau net agoras agrs a project at the forefront of reshaping how we conceive software development and decentralized ai 1500 usdt giveaway to make this ama extra special were giving away 1500 usdt to the top 15 questions 100 usdt each share your most insightful curious or inspiring questions for a chance to win who we are we are tau a ten year old software company pioneering logical ai software development weve developed a novel formal specification language called tau language intended for precise and accurate development of mission critical systems and complex software our novel use of formal specification enables correctbyconstruction software development thereby eliminating many of the problems that software development and machine learning ai still face eg bugs traditional testing costs hefty maintenance ai hallucination and many technical barriers to participation in development ultimately enabling anyone to be a developer what is tau net tau net is a decentralized blockchain network fully controlled governed and developed by its entire user base in a sound manner by allowing all users to write information in its system eg human knowledge personal opinions and desired behavior for the system to function in logical sentences that work as formal specifications these sentences are directly executable and thereby function as working software tau net logically reasons over the collective requirements given by its users and detects the agreement on how they want it to function and puts its own next version as the next block in its blockchain evolving from block to block resulting in rapid collaborative development agoras currency of tau agoras is the currency of tau net agrs pioneers in facilitating the exchange of knowledge computational assets and derivatives within the tau net ecosystem uniquely agrs stands as the worlds first token with usercontrolled tokenomics users describe in logical sentences how they want agrs to be like and tau net automatically detects and implements the agreement as executable software empowers tau nets users to effortlessly modify the tokenomics simply by voicing their desired specification what are our breakthroughs nvidias ceo shares a vision similar to our future of software and ai tau net introduces the concept of software as sentences this is a new method of developing software utilizing executable formal specifications different from code and typical machine learning eg chatgpt it enables users to describe how they want the network to be like in logical sentences these logical sentences are processed and understood by the network and directly executable as software accurate according to the description agoras agrs leverages this technology to allow usercontrolled tokenomics and a decentralized marketplace for knowledge derivatives and computational resources redefining ai logicbased ai vs mlbased ai todays most popular ai applications chatgpt bard etc rely on machine learning a probabilistic approach which is unable to guarantee accurate results contrarily tau net employs logicbased ai thereby being able to handle logical reasoning and deduce new facts from given knowledge all while guaranteeing that the result is completely accurate according to knowledge provided in addition tau net is also able to explain to the user how it arrived at a result therefore tau net is superior in its reasoning capabilities compared to machine learning based alternatives by offering formal proofs of correctness it addresses a pivotal challenge in the ai domain achieving absolute certainty in outcomes usercontrolled software and ai governance on tau net users are granted unprecedented control over the network tau net provides an effective solution to the ai alignment problem by enabling users to define rules or embed regulations directly within its software these rules are adhered to with proof even after any future updates it possesses the unique capability to automatically reject any attempts at tampering with its software especially if such attempts aim to introduce undesired behavior for instance if the command never send private data over the network is embedded tau net will consistently honor this rule automatically rejecting any future updates that contravene it this level of software integrity and compliance is unparalleled in the technology domain and important to ensure system integrity unlocking agi collective intelligence and combined brainpower on tau net on tau net collective intelligence emerges as users input their knowledge via descriptions in logical sentences enabled by tau language tau net is able to reason over given knowledge as well as combining knowledge and thereby deducing new enlightening facts and groundbreaking discoveries every piece of knowledge becomes maximally useful lying dormant until connected with another fact potentially yielding solutions to some of the worlds biggest problems this synergy propels tau net on the fastest path towards realizing agi marking a pivotal shift in how we harness and leverage collective intelligence for humanitys betterment furthermore this paradigm facilitates a knowledge market to trade and connect knowledge and brain power using agrs conclusion while many blockchain initiatives such as bitcoin proclaim decentralization they operate under centralized development teams contrarily tau net may be described as a decentralized expansive reasoning system that empowers users to contribute information that simultaneously serves as software which tau net is able process and integrate into subsequent versions this unique approach fosters mass collective intelligence enabling rapid robust collaborative development and truly decentralizes the development process in a coherent manner upcoming milestones tau language testnet were on the brink of releasing the tau language and testnet major milestones that will significantly enhance our ecosystems capabilities these developments are a testament to our commitment to innovation and our vision for a decentralized future join us ama details and resources mark your calendars for march 25th at 6pm utc and prepare your questions whether youre curious about the technical aspects the vision behind tau net or how you can get involved were here to answer to get a head start check out these valuable resources and join our community on social media founder interview tau net overview agoras overview research and background theory tau language follow us on twitter coinmarketcap were excited to engage with the rcryptocurrency community and share our journey towards revolutionizing ai and software development see you at the ama
2024-03-19,15:36:08,cryptocurrency,NVDA,NVIDIA,just digital gold it occurred to me freshly this morning that this community the including myself doesnt fully appreciate what digital gold means first i want to disclaim im skeptical that bitcoin can do everything im aboveaverage versed in the potential of bitcoin l2s and l3s but theres almost no question to me that something like a solana has an important place as a high tps platform so alts arent exactly coins to me they are venture capital and they will produce important things the general consensus i think is that bitcoin has or will have achieved the role of digital gold i think thats fair i think we all know no one will be building games on bitcoin for example that seems silly and games are a big part of our economy but i dont think we all appreciate what digital gold means this is because gold itself hasnt been used as the base layer of money properly in most all of our lifetimes when gold was at its height it was the measuring stick for all monetary value in the majority of the developed world lets try to see what that means just looking this up now total market cap of the top three companies in the world right now equals 8 trillion total market cap of gold by itself right now is 145 trillion lets call this the top3 to gold ratio and its about 0551 heres the current picture microsoft 21129b rev 31t mcap apple 383b rev 268 mcap nvidia 2697b rev 221 mcap avg 62126rev 266mcap valuation ratio mcap 428x annual revenue gold 2154 per ounce top 3 companies market cap is equivalent to the value of 37 billion ounces of gold lets look at 1929 standard oil 152 million rev general motors 15 million rev ford 114 million average 139m rev 428 595m mcap gold in 1929 2067 per ounce top 3 companies market cap was equivalent to the value of 287865 ounces of gold in 1929 so in a sense gold has been devalued today compared to 1929 theres all kinds of problems with the above comparison we didnt use modern multiples for companies back then global markets mean top products should be worth more although keep in mind i compared revenues so this should be accounted for somewhat etc but the general point is that gold was more dominant in 1929 than it is today when we say bitcoin is digital gold we should think about it closer to 1929 gold than modern gold this means were underestimating how big that is the measuring stick for all monetary value has a very large addressable market im more sure that bitcoin becomes gold than i am that solana becomes microsoft for example there are problems with that comparison too i know thats less important my bigger point is that we shouldnt sleep on what digital gold means what do you think
2024-03-17,17:50:18,cryptocurrency,NVDA,NVIDIA,crypto vs tech stocks is crypto really as risky as the sec says it is on the 10th january 2024 history was made when the sec granted the first spot bitcoin etf in the usa the sec was reluctant to approve the etfs because if you take them for their word they wish to protect investors from speculative assets and losing money so their statement of approval contained words of caution bitcoin is primarily a speculative volatile asset and investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto in this post i want to focus on the secs warning that bitcoin and crypto in general is a high risk investment in isolation that statement may be true but plenty of tradable assets approved by the sec are also considered risky i couldnt find sec statements warning against investing in specific assets besides bitcoin so the implication here is that bitcoin is especially risky to the extent that investors should be warned against it so they do not lose money as a fun and informative exercise i made four comparisons to highlight the relative risk of crypto vs tech stocks 1 the worst investments anyone could have made ever 1 the worst investments from the most recent market crash 1 the largest market cap loss 1 roi loss per day historically and recently this is a long post and i want to point out that if you appreciate clear data and objective analysis you might want to check out defidivecom this is a crypto price news and asset management terminal that i have built for now think of it like coinmarketcap with less clutter and distractions 1 worst investment possible crypto vs tech stocks asset start date end date start price end price 100 bought at top and sold at

ethereum have produced bad losses for anyone buying the top and selling the bottom but other tech stocks amazon amd peloton have delivered worse roi for unlucky investors it is worth noting that the market cap of bitcoin in 2011 was 173mm vs google in 2007 was 231b in other words bitcoin was worth 007 of google comparing bitcoins market crash vs publicly traded tech stocks puts bitcoin at a disadvantage because these tech stocks only have tradable shares once the company has grown to be large enough to list on a stock market for example google was founded six years before becoming a publicly traded stock in 2004 bitcoin became publicly tradable within a year of creation and ethereum was publicly tradable from the moment it was launched ultimately we are comparing bitcoin at age two years old ethereum three years old and google nine years old it is reasonable to expect higher volatility from newer and smaller assets 2 worst recent investments crypto vs tech stocks asset start

asset to lose over 1 trillion in value ethereum performs better than an average for the first time in this analysis the ranking of this table suggests bitcoin is comparable to big tech while ethereum is comparable to the large cap tech by none of the measures studied so far has bitcoin or ethereum performed the worst some might argue that perhaps the risk in crypto comes from the speed at which an investor might lose money so the following analysis looks at roi loss per day during market crashes 4 roi loss per day crypto vs tech stocks alltime worst market crash comparison asset start date

noncompounding during the 2011 crash which is almost twice as the next worst asset nvidia however we already established that bitcoin was so small in 2011 that we arent making a fair comparison here in the most recent market crash bitcoins roi loss per day was 021 which is similar to other tech stocks see next table below most recent market crash comparison asset start date crash length days

noncompounding that is clearly the worst result here but only one percentage point worse than netflix it is somewhat impressive that zoom and peloton have the lowest average roi loss per day but that is limited comfort to investors if the stock price never recovers objectively with ethereum already rebounding from 11k in dec22 to 39k in mar24 ethereum has been a better investment than peloton even if you did get rekt along the way conclusion out of everything i have studied not all of which made it into the final cut of this blog post i find this graph the most useful for summarising potential losses when investing in crypto and tech stocks looking back at the secs statement it does seem unfair to single bitcoin out as a volatile asset when bitcoin performed similarly to commonly traded tech stocks during the most recent market crash it feels like the sec statement is talking about bitcoins volatility as if it is 2011 if we were to take the secs statement as gospel we would expect this analysis to show bitcoin and ethereum are significantly more risky than tech stocks instead bitcoin performed similarly to other tech stocks during the recent market crash and ethereum performed not much worse a sidenote on beta beta is a measure of an assets correlation to the broader market this can be used as a proxy for measuring risk tech stocks have become so large that they effectively become the broader market you can see below they all have betas close to one in other words if big tech share prices go up or down so does the sp 500 crypto has little correlation to the sp 500 partly because it has outperformed it over the past 14 years this gives crypto a beta close to 0 which effectively means anything or nothing could happen when the sp 500 rises or falls the beta for crypto has increased since 2020 but it is still far away from other tech stocks in practice this means that crypto could be considered as a method to diversify away from tech stocks sp 500 ironically you could make the argument that this helps lower the overall risk of a portfolio if someone invests sensibly into crypto to achieve more diversification asset beta interpretation ethereum 008 the assets

2024-03-14,13:44:45,cryptocurrency,TSLA,Tesla,we could slowly see silent mass adoption of crypto sending money via bank or purchasing stuff with credit card feels so fast but in truth it is not it consumes so much energy and timeyou might see a transaction credited but in real it is still in the works for days crypto solves this problem this is why payment companies such as paypal mastercard visaall of them are testing adopting crypto people who uses them will be indirectly using crypto without knowing that elon might allow people to buy his tesla cars with doge i think it is just pr but it will get peoples attention 1 step to get retail back into crypto very soon coinbase is rumored to become a bank on its own jp morgan the biggest bank in us has its own blockchain its also uses axelar a blockchain to experiment with transactions wrapping assets it could be this cycle or the next but mass adoption is coming there is no way around it will it impact future prices me as a crypto investor am so excited

2024-03-08,20:45:04,cryptocurrency,AAPL,Apple,qr coins since apple news a couple weeks this news broke since then projects with emphasis on quantum resistance qr continue to climb algo qanx cell and qrl are most often mentioned for preparing coin bureau team had also been watching this as a narrative that could take hold this year theyve shared a public video about what to watch for i sort of fell into learning about the quantum computing risk a few years ago after buying a qr coin over that time ive concluded that businesses get it and take it very seriously case in point with apple also google chrome searches retail has been resistant to listen because of the impacts to btceth and other top projects its usually met with quantum will never happen or it will be an easy upgrade as we know nothing is easy in a decentralized world from consensus build test to roll out and since the initial weakness is with your signature it will require time for users to migrate their holdings to a secure solution as you can imagine i get beat up with that message so why do i still hold because if businesses get it and are still trying to figure out how they can effectively use blockchain i think they can grab some of that market that really is qanplatform focus with multilanguage smart contracts and hybrid chain along with qr and evm compatibility this includes being able to use existing evm wallets and i think this can be true for more than 1 quantum resistant project that is properly prepared if the narrative takes off with retail i just view it as a big bonus in the end id keep an eye what is happening and do some research these coins definitely have a head start on this regardless of when you think the public will demand the risk is addressed

2024-03-04,03:20:11,cryptocurrency,TSLA,Tesla,deep dive what dogecoin teaches us about human psychology introduction hyatt hotels toshiba fidelity wise and booz allen hamilton are corporate titans in their respective industry sectors by offering services that touch the lives of many whether in booking a hotel retreat or facilitating seamless travel or delivering the latest cuttingedge gadget all have gained the coveted status of a household name yet the common connection they all share is a market cap similar to a trollcoin designed to have no worth currently priced at us 013 as of the time of writing on 29th february after a 57 rally this week and holding a market cap of us 19 billion is dogecoin ticker symbol doge unpretentiously and unapologetically selling nothing but a bunch of warnings not to invest i end up questioning the world we live in when nothing of tangible value seems to be attributed to the somewhat success of the project the current pump dont buy they said dogecoin underscores the evolving dynamics within the cryptocurrency landscape challenging conventional notions of value and market influence in this article we explore how a bunch of dogood social sentiments and an unlikely series of events culminated in dogecoin becoming a prominent feature in modern internet culture and curiously how it can be valued as much as it isdogecoin born out of the internet cultures love for memes and the desire to create a fun and friendly cryptocurrency has emerged as a distinctive player in the world of digital assets dogecoin was started in 2013 by jackson palmer and billy markus who initially created it as a joke based on a cute shiba inu dog with poor grammar aptly thinking that the cryptocurrency industry was being taken far too seriously they took a copy of litecoins code developers known this as forking removed the maximum coin minting limit and changed some of the codes variables to ensure that the coins supply was so generous that it would be worth fractions of a cent unlike bitcoin which has a capped supply dogecoin keeps making more with billions of coins entering circulation each year this feature has sparked debate within the crypto community giving rise to questions and discussions about the projects longterm viability critics argue that a generous coin supply may pose challenges to establishing and maintaining a robust and enduring economic framework for the token in science we use the word antithesis to describe the difference between two ideals or mindsets in its design proposition stands an antithesis to conventional wisdom in a combination of factors that really should not work yet in its viral launch it quickly gained traction surpassing bitcoins transaction volume in two weeks and becoming reddits tipping currency of choice before venturing into the cryptocurrency industry my professional experience was in investment banking there the common tools for analyzing a company is a slew of corporate jargon with terms such as balance sheets liabilities and net asset values those on the trading floor went by a vocabulary of fixed income returns blackscholes and fundamental analysis all elaborate methods that might seem like ways to justify hefty paychecks all of which fall flat when applied to dogecoin we might be tempted to think that a business or finance major would be better suited to exploring the themes of dogecoin price action however i saw an opportunity to explore a passion of mine a deep dive into social psychology and behavioral economics to draw a conclusion into the irrationality of dogecoins price action the coins journey evolved in an unexpected rise when highprofile endorsements particularly from figures like elon musk pushed dogecoin into the mainstream musks tweets became a catalyst for dogecoin price movements the elon effect on dogecoins price if you think about dogecoin you will think of musk the billionaire really loves the coin and every time he tweets about it the price goes up with 174 million x twitter followers his ability to significantly swing the markets is uncanny and has at times gotten him into a lot of trouble on february 4th 2021 he posted several tweets of dogecoin sending the price flying over 40 within the day source tradingview ur welcome x200b on december 14th 2021 he announced that tesla would trial run accepting dogecoin for merchandise and the price jumped over 30 in the subsequent four hours x200b source tradingview based on this chart below the price of dogecoin went parabolic subsequent to musks tweets the concept of behavioral finance behavioral finance and behavioral economics examine how psychological factors and emotional biases influence financial decisions and market outcomes while in the presence of wellspoken finance folks ones we might find at our friendly neighborhood bank branch were told that markets are rational and so it might not make immediate sense that in reality markets however justified are still run by their ultimate decision makers human beings in the spirit of mental health awareness we have to be brutally honest with ourselves that we are just as fallible to the forces of human nature then the next in the case of dogecoin and musks tweets there is some interesting psychology at play herding behavior fear of missing out fomo whether we like to admit it or not we are social creatures that often follow the crowd and are influenced by the actions of others in the context of dogecoin musks fanboying about the meme to his large following creates a desire for others often sharing real time about their purchases to follow the herd anchoring anchoring occurs when individuals fixate on specific prices or values often the first one they encounter musks tweets can serve as anchors setting a reference point for investors and influencing their perceptions of a coins value we see this at play when followup comments are posted in response to musks original dogecoin related tweets overreaction and underreaction celebrity endorsement behavioral finance suggests that markets can overreact or underreact to new information musks tweets especially because they are so unexpected and due to his influence trigger exaggerated market responses causing rapid price movements in 2018 sec charged musk with securities fraud drawing conclusion that a tweet in what some thought was a joke of taking tesla private at 420 caused the stock to jump 6 triggering the stock exchanges emergency circuit breaker which temporarily halted trading the sec at the time quoted its enforcement officer steven peikin in a statement sharing that an officers celebrity status or reputation as a technological innovator does not give license to take those responsibilities lightly human bias confirmation bias is recognised in psychology as a human tendency to favor information that confirms preexisting beliefs and values scientists like daniel khaneman in the field of behavioral economics often explore ways to mitigate the effects of confirmation bias as it can lead to flawed reasoning reinforce existing beliefs and contribute to the persistence of stereotypes musks tweets often shared by dogecoin enthusiasts serve to reinforce positive views and affirm prior decisions nassim taleb author of the black swan another pioneer in the field of behavioral economics explains that humans have a tendency to use recent experience as a baseline for what will happen in the future a frequent reminder provided by musk by his repetitive sharing of doge related content helps remind you that we should all be holding dogecoin algorithms increasingly dictate our perspective of the world with a phenomenon emerging in recent years known as a filter bubble eli pariser activist and author first popularised this concept and explains how modern technology from search engines to social media platforms are designed in a way whereby our past interests will determine what we are exposed to in the future the result is an algorithmic bias for images and content following the themes of our favorite meme and further while these are the core tenets of behavioral finance understanding the complexities of human behavior can lead us to observe that studying political theory would provide snippets of rationale behind those banding behind musks dogecoin tweets observed in this context as a way to share antiestablishment and financial libertarian ideals he becomes a convenient spokesperson whose tweets are easily liked and shared among our peers whats next dogecoin developers announced that a physical dogecoin token could reach earths moon on 23rd december 2023 in a space payload mission planned by pittsburgbased firm astrobotic this mission is in addition to the launch of doge1 satellite which was initially set for 2022 and now targeted for later in 2024 as this is a huge step forward for dogecoin the crypto community is anticipating a tweet from musk about this moon mission which will propel the price of dogecoin to new heights x200b to the moon conclusion in crypto psychology and behavioral finance matter just as much as fundamentals despite dogecoins origin as a joke the substantial impact of musks influence and the vibrant community surrounding this dogthemed cryptocurrency significantly shapes its market dynamics beyond the memedriven hype dogecoin has found practical use cases the coin is increasingly embraced for tipping and charitable donations due to its low transaction fees additionally the upcoming launch of a physical dogecoin token to the moon and the doge1 satellite project showcase the coins potential utility in spacerelated missions we live in a world where significant value is attributed to social sentiments but never before have we lived in a world where it has been measurable realtime interesting social experiment to gauge the value of mutual good driven and combined with capitalisms finest motivators to get rich a solid investment

ammous book the bitcoin standard 2018 if you havent read the bitcoin standard you may be surprised to learn that its not primarily about bitcoin its primarily about something which has been closely associated with bitcoin from the beginning namely the importance of sound money with that said i wont be diving into its primary subject matter straight away ill take up the question of why sound money is important in my second post here im going to focus on an equally important logically prior question what is money im going to explain why this question has the power to change the world ammous has a lot to say about money but one of the most important themes of the bitcoin standard is that whatever else money is its something with respect to which people should have substantial freedom of choice since genuine freedom of choice requires genuine availability of options ammous attitude is also strongly laissez faire ie let the competition begin and may the best money win despite his strong belief in monetary freedom of choice ammous never explicitly advocates for what seems to me like an obvious concomitant that people have a basic right to choose what form of money they transact in im going to return to this idea that we have a right to choose which type or form of money we use shortly when i propose my own answer to the question of what money is but first i need to address an obvious complication which is that belief in monetary freedom of choice goes strongly against the grain of most modern thinking politicians and policymakers around the world implicitly assume that whatever else money is its something which they ought to control for ease of discussion it will help to coin some terms for two opposing schools of thought lets say that anyone who believes that people have a right to choose what form of money they use is a monetary libertarian ammous is very likely a monetary libertarian even if he never quite says so at the opposite end of the spectrum are those who deny that any such right exists these are the monetary authoritarians they would say that a nations currency ought to be mandated by its government and overseen by a central authority eg a central bank whose primary job is to set monetary policy much of the bitcoin standard serves as an indictment of monetary authoritarianism ammous main line of criticism can be summed up in the assertion that monetary authoritarianism has a proven history of eventuating in unmitigated fiscal fusterclucks eg ruinous inflation boom and bust cycles defaulting on the national debt and so on although this line of argument has a lot going for it it also faces one very serious obstacle which is that true believers will respond that monetary authoritarianism has only ever failed because the wrong people were in charge well get it right this time the perennial defenders of various isms always say because were better and smarter the true believers unshakable faith in the benevolence and wisdom of centralized authority is what brings us to my main goal for this post which is to suggest an alternative strategy for tearing down the structures of monetary authoritarianism this is also where we circle back to the question which i motivated in an admittedly melodramatic fashion at the outset for once we have a proper understanding of what money is well see that people do in fact have a fundamental right to choose their money a right which precludes the hope that politicians and policymakers will finally get it right this time if you pick up any introductory textbook on economics or a related field youre bound to come across a discussion of the three basic functions of money ammous even rehearses them in the first chapter of the bitcoin standard this is a very standard way of explaining what money is but the three basic functions are clearly pointing to something deeper about the fundamental nature of money which is that money is a tool for solving economic problems many of the problems that money solves are economically fundamental in that solving them is what separates primitive economies from more advanced economies instead of using money primitive economies use the barter system wherein goods are exchanged directly for other goods the barter system only works on a very small scale and for this reason our most fundamental economic problems are also among the most fundamental problems pertaining to the human condition simply put its much harder to sustain a growing population on a primitive economy by allowing humanity to advance in ways that would otherwise be impossible money solves problems which are endemic to the human condition cutting to the chase the first main claim i want to make concerns the fundamental nature of money m1 money is a tool for solving humanitys most fundamental economic problems many of which are problems endemic to the human condition one basic economic problem is that wants do not always coincide heres a concrete illustration suppose the cobbler wants some apples but that the apple farmer doesnt need shoes in that case the cobbler will have to arrange a series of trades in order to acquire whatever it is that the apple farmer wants if the cobbler is lucky the series of trades will be short its possible the apple farmer wants oranges and the orange farmer happens to need new shoes but experience teaches that things are rarely ever that simple money solves the cobblers problem by serving as a medium of exchange which everyone will accept instead of arranging a complex series of trades the cobbler just sells his shoes and uses the cash to buy some apples in this way money greatly simplifies the process of economic exchange which frees people up to spend less time making trades and more time producing economic goods here are a few more problems that money solves suppose the apple farmer wants a new house one immediate problem is that it will be very difficult to store up a houses worth of apples even if he somehow manages it another problem is that the apples will rot long before they can be consumed money however presumably doesnt rot this makes it a much better store of value another of the three basic functions instead of trying to save up a mountain of apples the apple farmer can save up the money he gets from selling his crops in addition to being a medium of exchange and a store of value money also functions as a unit of account altogether these constitute the three basic functions of money my proposal then is that money is ultimately a tool for solving humanitys most fundamental economic problems given that many textbooks already say more or less the same thing this suggestion shouldnt be too controversial what will be much more controversial is my claim about the implications for monetary freedom of choice m2 if money is a tool for solving humanitys most fundamental economic problems many of which are endemic to the human condition then people have a right to choose the form or type of money that best solves those problems money is an incredibly powerful economic tool it is in many ways a prerequisite for the advancement of human civilization yet it can only work its magic through those who use it monetary authoritarians the world over think of money as just another tool which governments use to manage the lives of their citizens what they fail to comprehend is that we are the ones who collectively imbue currencies with their transformative power money is not a gift which governments graciously bestow upon their subjects it is a tool empowered by those who use it the ones who need it to solve their basic economic problems since we are both the source of its power and the end which it serves we should have the freedom to put our collective agency behind the money of our choosing we should have the freedom to choose the money that best solves the problems that our money is supposed to solve namely our problems and if that money happens to be bitcoin then we should have the freedom to choose bitcoin

2024-02-25,16:51:20,cryptocurrency,AAPL,Apple,apple adds pq3 quantumresistant encryption to imessage by now youve likely noticed that top companies are already implementing encryption that is prepared for quantum computing these updates are needed for digital signatures that currently protect your keys apple is doing this to protect your imessage i think we should have at least that same security for our crypto assets typically someone will say if quantum can hack your wallet everything will be vulnerable and thats right which is why apple and google and governments and military and banks and everyone else are preparing or already implementing solutions we are sleeping at the wheel we cant just sit back and say this will be quickly and easily fixed when the time comes if crypto isnt prepared like everyone else it will be an easy target to gain consensus build and test we likely will need years plus we need to give people time to transition assets to a new set of keys that arent vulnerable im not sure what well do with old wallets from the satoshi days there is a lot of btc sitting there and many have even older encryption that is vulnerable even if they never transacted when we do try to transition asking users to adopt wallets they dont know will not go well i would like to see top coins implement a cross signing model like qanplatform has built this will allow users to continue using evm wallets they know and trust that will limit disruption and allow us to continue using the ecosystem thats been developed to create wider adoption cryptocurrency should be leading this effort for secure digital assets and it needs to start now there are too many advancements in quantum computing and more efficient algos to ignore

2024-02-21,12:26:33,cryptocurrency,NVDA,NVIDIA,good news boys the shills are back en masse which means the bull run is just around the corner i posted something about cardano the other day nothing too bad just asking a question is all of course many of its regular shills and fan boys came to support it but i noticed something curious days after i posted it and long after it fell out of any rankings here in this subreddit the paid shills and possibly bots were leaving long drawn out defenses for their beloved cardano which i thought was strange because they must have been actively searching for posts like these in order to defend their beloved ada coin you can check my history if youd like to see what i am referring to but my point is the last time this was a thing was the lead up to and during the last bull run of 2021 so it may be a good sign that the bull might come early this time around well this and the fact that bitcoin and ethereum are approaching alltime highs again which we all know is when profits are taken and then put into the alts kicking off that sweet sweet alt rally and all the gains that will come from it nvidia may set it off early too because depending on earnings today all the just in it for the gains folks might sell and theyll all need a new place to park their money for to earn 100 plus gains this year and we all know thats got the cryptocurrency market written all over it i still think 2025 is going to be our next 2017 and 2021 but who knows we may not all want to wait that long

2024-02-09,07:27:02,cryptocurrency,AAPL,Apple,is plutus imploding this probably sounds a bit like a fudey post but im honestly just frustrated with whats going on at plutus and wanted to post it here to see if others feel similar plutus is a crypto card or was that gives you an attractive cashback rate depending on how much plu you have and perks that are rebated for example spotifynetflixapple oneetc plutus has been going slowly downhill for a while with sudden changes more frequent than a kid with adhd constant delays to announced features like apple pay google pay dex and general incompetence on how to run a financial product im wondering if theyre about to implode recent changes temporary deactivation of the dex the dex was a system inside plutus that allows you to sell plu or eth tokens directly for example to charge your card with it that got temporarily disabled and the date to reenable kept getting pushed and pushed this means the only way to sell the plu cashback you get is to cash it out to a thirdparty wallet by paying 750 transfer it to an exchange and sell it reduced dex fees are a advertised benefit according to their current plan tiers even though the dex is not usable the blog post that announced pausing the dex was published in february 2022 almost an entire year ago if they were to revamp the dex why not leave the old system up until the new one is ready to me this feels like an artificial halting of selling of plu to keep the price up disabling of fiat withdrawsend plutus wanted to be a banklike app so you get an iban and you can send money in that you can use on your card a couple of weeks ago withdrawing of fiat got disabled with the explanation that they need to increase security no timeline was given on when it will be available again so to summarize this plutus now is a banklike app that allows you to send money in but not send money out the only way to get money out is to spend it on the card and you cant top up revolut for example i just checked my emails to see if i got anything that tells me this but nothing so if i didnt try to withdraw i probably wouldnt even know today another change hit you can no longer send money in from accounts that arent in your name a few fintech apps have similar restrictions so not big deal but considering they want to be banklike i wanted to mention it just owning plu is no longer enough to get cashbackperks you have to subscribe to a monthly plan with cash after a couple of different announcements of changes it looks like plutus settled on this in order to get any cashback whatsoever either through purchases or perks you have to subscribe to one of the 3 available plans even if you bought a ton of plu previously to unlock one of the staking tiers that give you more perks in order to now get the same cashback from those perks you need to subscribe independently of stacking level with cash effectively breaking the original agreement made when users bought those plu tokens also interesting here is that there is no mechanism to use plu directly to pay for subscriptions lots of obstacles you have to jump through to withdraw plu turning plu into cash is getting harder and harder after getting cashback the plu is frozen for 45 days until you can do anything with it to withdraw after waiting 45 days you have to connect a thirdparty wallet like metamask and then pay a 750 withdrawal fee also the minimum withdrawal limit is 50 so if your cashback is under 50 you cant withdraw it at all there is also no longer a way to directly use plu to charge the card or pay for subscriptions so plutus is now a debit card that gives you crypto but cant use crypto introduction of spending limits to get cashback together with the new plans we got tighter spending limits to increase the spending limit you have to redeem plu aka burning it the lowest plan starter now has a limit of 250 so additional purchases after you hit this limit will not give you any rewards this is the purchase amount not the cashback amount its obvious that this is an attempt to put utility into the plu token and reduce emission but the incremental changes make the system harder and harder to understand forcing people to create spreadsheets constant delays to everything and blaming others like visa for it constant delays to announcements since the card migration to modulr more on that later apple pay google pay got delayed so often that soon tm is now a meme over at rplutus there are constant claims that its in beta and the reason why its not live yet is because visa found some issues with tokenization or something like that and theyre working with them uhmmm sure plutus is working directly with visa and not their issuer modulr and visa of all companies has problems with enabling apple pay eg botched card migration lack of physical card and recommending curve as a solution plutus switched from solaris to modulr at the end of last year instead of having both in parallel and fading out solaris the migration happened extremely close to each other with some people not having their virtual modulr card until days before the solaris one stops working notably the new card had no physical version which was coming soon but got delayed a couple of times until the first cards finally arrived like last week the new physical card also costs 10 to issue even if you had the previous solaris one so a company that gives you cashback on purchases and rebates on things like supermarkets physical no longer had a physical card or any other means to use the service in physical stores due to lack of applegoogle pay the official solution from plutus was to just use curve a thirdparty card provider that proxies other cards introduction of ambassadors sometime last year plutus started paying ambassadors to support their public image ambassadors have to rate plutus with 5 stars and almost every post on rplutus gets lots of very cool so nice again great progress from plutus cant wait to see what comes next comments that make it sound like the sub is full of bots and hides actual sentiment theyll be on this post as well tldr general incompetence or signs of implosion a lot of these things like changes to plans or cards werent properly communicated outside of reddittwitter occasionally an email comes in but it doesnt make it clear whats actually going on without following on reddit i would have missed most of it and probably started wondering why im no longer getting cashback even while writing this post i wanted to check their official website for some of these new systems but had to fall back to google to find the relevant help pages i dont know if plutus is just this bad at communicating or if these are attempts to purposely hide information the recent changes to tiers and plans tell me that the company may be in financial trouble and probably realized that just giving tokens to people without any utility is not enough to keep the organization going now trying to figure out how to do business without a clear plan forward concerning things around the company inability to provide proper timelines for their financial product or handle important migrations like card issuer smoothly constant delays to promised features applegoogle paydex disabling of basic financial functions like withdrawing of fiat and since today also depositing from accounts that are not in ones name sudden introduction of changes and then reverting those changes lack of communication for people that arent on reddittwitter all the time concerning things around the plu token obstacles added to withdraw and sell plu like disabling of the dex without an alternative 45 days lockup or 75 euro withdrawal fee feel like artificial halting of plu selling introduction of caps changing of existing agreements like stacking of plu by trying to force users that may have bought a lot of plu that has since lost value into monthly subscriptions or lose their benefits attempts at adding tokenomics aka burning plu to raise spending limits that didnt exist previously aka adding a restriction and then a way to remove that new restriction even with a monthly sub its still pretty simple to make up for it with enough perks so its not too bad but plutus doesnt feel great currently and im not sure i want to trust them with my cash what does rcc think am i just reading too much into this

2024-01-19,03:02:21,cryptocurrency,AAPL,Apple,a wallet with apple paylike transactions that rounds up to the nearest dollar and auto invests the difference into a preselected crypto portfolio im curious if this already exists could only really work on a chain with tiny fees or maybe it makes the investment periodically to allow enough to accumulate so all your investments arent lost to fees basically what the title says you buy coffee for 465 the wallet rounds up and puts 35 cents automatically into a crypto portfolio or some stupid high risk meme coin of your choice basically it all goes to 0 and you couldnt care less or you some how manage to make 1000 maybe it links directly with apple pay so you dont have to use something you arent already using although maybe theres a security concern there would be great if the wallet had premade portfolios from other people you can select so theres a community component would also significantly reduce the friction for new crypto people who couldnt care less about creating their own portfolio and instead just pick one so their wallet can auto invest into it is this already out there if not why couldnt it work

2024-01-15,07:18:52,cryptocurrency,AAPL,Apple,the year 2023 in bitcoin cash from mrzwets article on read dot cash ___________________________ buckle up 2023 was quite the ride cashtokens toolchain bitcoin cash ended 2022 with the cashtokens lockin date on november 15th when the proposed upgrades chips got accepted and activated on chipnet the testnet to stage bch network upgrades to actually start developing with the new cashtokens features a whole toolchain had to get extended first and thats what happened over the coming months this effort to upgrade the toolchain started at the end of 2022 with libauth the low level speedfocused jasvascript library developed by jason drayzehener the cashtokens author which introduced cashtokens support to the alpha version next in december 22 still the fulcrum indexers released a new version which supported serving cashtokens information and alongside the mainnetjs library got upgraded by pat and released as v10 with cashtokens support with some of the core pieces ready for cashtokens development on chipnet this brought us to the start of 2023 cashtokens on chipnet 2023 started with people utilizing these tools to start prototyping new applications early january i mathieu g was the first person to take advantage of these new tools to publicly start developing a minimumviable cashtokens wallet and was doing so very publicly in an attempt to garner interest from other developers alongside the wallet the first cashtokens explorer was also in development it is exciting to truly pioneer innovation thats also how it felt playing around with the bcmr metadatastandard to actually add a name and an icon to the cashtokens on chipnet community learning alongside the development of the toolchain and first basic applications there was also a lot of community learning going on discussions about how cashtokens compared to other token systems like slp and erc20 and discussions about how bchs smart contract capabilities now compare to those of ethereum the toolchain got further upgraded by chaingraph adding support for cashtokens this was a super important addition as chaingraph allows to make complex queries for example to get all the addresses holding a certain cashtoken let the countdown begin midfebruary in a much awaited move coindance added a countdown to the bitcoin cash page counting from 90days down towards the cashtokens upgrade in the meanwhile i kept working on the cashtokens wallet to enable easy tokencreation which allowed nondevs to also get involved on chipnet flipstarter funding the ecosystem with the upgrade coming closer there was the clear need for a cashtokens explorer with bcmr metadata support luckily salem kode took the initiative launching a crowd funder and got the support to successfully fundraise the project rosco and i also finished the work on upgrading cashscript for cashtokens releasing a beta version 2 months in advance of the actual activation date which represent the final piece in the toolchain to being able to build smart contract applications along side this the flipstarter for continued development on mainnetjs also got funded to for continued maintenance development electron cash also launched and successfully funded a flipstarter to add cashtokens support to the desktop wallet defi on bch although cashtokens took much of the spotlight consistent improvement were also made to bch bull the inhouse platform by general protocols for anyhedge smart contracts in february general protocols announced that over 43000 bch got locked in anyhedge smart contracts since october 2022 another milestone for the protocol was reached in march with a listing an the defi metric site defi lama anyhedge now had over 1200000 tvl that same month according to defi lama then midapril bch bull had its production release introducing 2x the contract size 3x the contract duration approx 30 cheaper fees additional asset cny premium tracker and language localization according to the announcement first cashtokens apps in development the push for cashtokens infrastructure and tooling was sorely needed however with this focus on tooling some people were worried about the lack of announcement for big projects building on top of cashtokens a first sign of a big cashtokens project in the works came with paytacas demo midapril showcasing connecting the paytaca wallet to participate in a cashtokens nft minting contract to mint cat nfts these announcements stayed out until may 1st with the announcement of the bch guru project a collectible nft project on cashtokens planning to make a price prediction app the guru project was an important part in building anticipation for the cashtokens network upgrade with their announcement song and countdown to the upgrade together with the announcements of the first cashtokens projects there was also a big increase in the information content and marketing around cashtokens the bch podcast hosted by jeremy was incredibly consistent with having guests on to talk about the upcoming upgrade and everything else happening in the cryptoscene for example the brc20 drama of how fungible tokens using the ordinals protocol were added to bitcoin this also served as a great way to contrast what btc was doing versus what bch was focusing on the day before the mainnet launch of cashtokens electrum cash released a beta version with cashtokens support in anticipation of the mainnet activation the paytaca team also released an update to their browser extension wallet adding the capability to receive cashtokens and added paytacaconnect which allows the extension to interact with smart contract web applications dapps activation day community marketing efforts had been ramping up with podcast episodes countdowns a few high profile articles and a celebration upgrade stream on twitch development efforts had been ramping up too to get the 3 different wallets compatible with cashtokens and ready for mainnet the cashtokens activation day went without any issue on the protocol level there were some hiccups on the application side cashonize using mainnetjs was not properly displaying tokens for mainnet which lead to some emergency debugging on activation day we saw the launch of the first project built on the new cashtokens functionality with the emerald dao project by bitcoincashautist it launched on the upgrade day itself and utilized the brand new paytacaconnect functionality to connect your paytaca browser extension wallet to the emerald dao dapp to lock up bch and mint an emerald nft the cashtokens launch day is also the genesis for the dogecash memetoken which got created in the first hour or so after launch besides cashtokens related stuff the upgrade day also marked the reveal and beta release of the selene wallet a brand new bchonly wallet with great focus on usability and with a strong focus on bch specific features despite the very positive community sentiment and technical advances the price had stagnate around only 120 since the beginning of the year so any pricepump on the activation turned out to be hopium even though the bch fundamentals got a lot better start of the cashtokens ecosystem the paytaca team had also prepared their own project to utilize with the paytacaconnect functionality of their browser namely the bitcats nft collection they revealed the project a few days after the cashtokens upgrade and just like the emerald dao it used the new cashtokens features in cashscript for their project this demonstrates a trend for future bch dapps wallet connect cashscript smart contract an unfortunate thing that happened soon after the cashtokens launch is that impersonators copied the open source code of my cashtokens webwallet and launched fake versions of the wallet in an attempt to steal peoples fund because of this my webwallet had to urgently get a clear brand and domainname luckily for me jason dreyehner the author of the cashtokens spec came to help out when working out the best course of action and deciding on a new brand jason suggested cashonize which i loved right away a few days later my webwallet finally had a clear brand after more than 5 months of development pieces coming together two weeks after the cashtokens launch paytaca revealed their cashtokens roadmap related to the bitcats project first they wanted to finish proper support for cashtokens in their wallet then they wanted to develop and nft marketplace which is an essential piece for actually allow the bitcats nfts to be traded and lastly they planned to build a cashtokens airdrop tool later that week a cashtokens marketplace already appeared with the launch of tapswap tapswap is a noncustodial marketplace for cashtokens so it allows the buying and selling of both fungible and nonfungible cashtokens tapswap was the third dapp to leverage paytacaconnect to allow for a great user experience linking an application to your wallet tapswap functioned as an enabler for the nascent cashtokens ecosystem featuring the bitcats and emerald dao allowing people to trade and collect them as well as the other usercreated tokens june 1st 2 weeks after the launch of the cashtokens ecosystem there was the highly anticipated launch of the bch guru nfts the project sold out their first wave of 2000 nfts in less than 24 hours the surrounding hype also served as a very positive environment for tapswap with much trading activity taking place the biggest drawback of paytacaconnect used by tapswap the bitcats and the emerald dao is the lockin to a custom integration which only works with the paytaca browser extension realizing this shortcoming pat launched a flipstarter campaign to design and implement a walletconnect v2 implementation in the beginning of june such a general wallet connect implementation that can be implemented by multiple wallet and isnt specific to just browser extension wallets is an essential piece of infrastructure for dapps this way many different wallets and all their users can interact with different smart contract applications without needing being reliant on any specific wallet which allows users to easily switch or use multiple different ones price pump any effect of all these developments on price remained absent with the bch price being even on a bit of a decline since the start of the year from 125 to 105 this changed spectacularly on the last week of june when the price almost 3xed up to a high of 305 stabilizing around 220 crypto prices work in mysterious ways this could be seen as the long awaited cashtokens pump even though fundamentals probably did have nothing to do with it amm dexes on july 1st cauldron dex launched with 1 trading pair bchsock their own token which is redeemable for realworld socks the dapp uses a builtin webwallet similar to bch bull platform besides cauldron there was also another amm dex released called fexcash instead of the bcmr metadata standard it focused on crc20 tokens crc20 is a token standard on top of cashtokens which introduces a squattable name system for tokennames this way the protocol incentives claiming popular names squatting with the hopes of being to resell them later the crc20 standard was something specific to projects and builders in the chineseeastern bch ecosystem but there was pretty much no outreach or collaboration with the rest of the cashtokens ecosystem which was building upon the bcmr metadata standard which doesnt have a squattable tokenname gimmick end of june paytaca delivered on their roadmap item to upgrade their mobile for cashtokens with this achievement it was the first cashtokens app for mobile in july paytaca had more great news to share they successfully finished a 450 k funding round this makes them one of the best funded organizations in bch without a doubt and enables them to expand the scope of their products further in july selene wallet had their launch in the apple app store allowing ios users to also use the new bch only wallet cash token drama there was also some drama over the summer because of a paid bitcoindotcom press release promotion article for a cashtoken called cash confusingly although it had nothing to do with the protocol itself the token tried to position itself like ordi in the ordinals ecosystem a token without use but which is seen as the face of the tokenecosystem in a promo video they claimed it would make sense for cash to have 1 to 10 of the value of bch luckily the bch communitys immune system kicked in like an overtrained muscle to get the article remove and warn everybody about the misleading pumpanddump project cash was one of the first tokens created following the crc20 standard reflecting bad upon the creators as it was not clear whether they were associated bch day august 1st which is the bitcoin cash anniversary aka bch day the second wave of 2000 bch guru nfts was released at a slightly increased price also on bch day i helped itachu tokenize art in celebration of the bitcoin cash anniversary itachu is an independent digital artist who previously created the reapers collection for sbch and he released his first work on cashtokens with his graffiti artwork on bch day this collaboration between the two of us would be the start of a whole journey for the remainder of the year fungibles catching up early august was also the release of tokenstork an overview website for fungible cashtokens with the intent to become a coinmarketcaplike website the first version of the website did not have priceinformation for the tokens only information on the supply tokenid and social media links for each token project this was because of the simple reason that there was no dex to get the token prices from there was only tapswap the cashtokens marketplace this changed later in august with the cauldron beta which allows for users to add trading pairs to the website by adding the initial liquidity it also enabled users to create an additional micropools for already existing trading pairs and earn so fee percentage this way a first example of yield on cashtokens tooling tooling tooling over the summer there was another big push to improve the tooling for devloping with cashtokens for example mid july the bitcash library released version 100 which added cashtokens support to the library it was the first python library to add cashtokens support diversifying the tooling away from the heavy javascript focus another major piece of infrastructure the bch full node with integrated address indexer successfully completed a crowdfunder to bring the node back into consensus and have it validate the new network rules this means catching up with the last 2 upgrades when it fell out of consensus notable was that an outside developer op_return stepped up to take the initiative and with this committed to maintaining the project for multiple years there were also some minor pieces of tooling i created like a bcmr token explorer and a bcmrgenerator then there was also the crowfunder for cashscript to upgrade the sdk for smart contract interactions by creating an advanced transaction builder and to add reusable libraries to cashscript flipstarter once again proved itself as a vital tool for funding infrastructuree public goods in the bch space the next upgrade with the cashtokens upgrade already being long in the pipeline and being lockedin in november there had already been a lot of work on proposals for the next upgrade the main contender became the adaptive blocksize limit chip by bitcoincashautist the key idea was to solve the need for a small group of technical leaders to have to decide when and by how much to increase the blocksize on a continuous basis instead an algorithm was fixed in advance which is slowly adaptive to the actual needs of the network automatically allowing upto a 2x increase in allowed throughput each year tooling nft mint on august 8th i teased to be working on something big with itachu later josh ellithorpe the well known bch dev who previously worked with itachu on the reapers project on sbch had also joined the team the reveal of this secretive project came on september 1st cashninjas project the tooling to do an nft minting contract on cashtokens was sorely missing thats why the goal with the cashninjas from the beginning was to develop opensource for cashtokens nft mints for others to use we designed our minting contract from the ground up and innovated on the approach of the bitcats to enable a multithreaded minting contract and reveal the art right at mint the cashninjas roadmap included bridging the reapers nfts over from the dead smartbch sidechain to cashtokens integrated ecosystem the launch of the cashninjas was delayed by exactly one week until october 8th this gave enough time to finish the wallet connect functionality into the minting dapp the day before the cashninjas mint i merged the work by pat to integrate walletconnect into cashonize with this cashonize was officially the first wallet on bitcoin cash supporting the general wallet connect protocol with pats bch integration the next day october 8th the cashninjas launched as a fully opensource project with cashonize as the only compatible wallet two days after the launch of the mint there was already a second compatible wallet when zapit added support for wallet connect this was quickly followed by paytaca which added walletconnect support a few days later now suddenly the 3 cashtokens wallets were all capable of of connecting to the cashninjas website and minting nfts the ecosystem for fungible cashtokens also became a much more integrated towards the end of september when tokenstork integrated cauldron prices with cauldron as the pricesource tokenstork could accurately calculate the totalvaluelocked tlv and the market cap for the different fungible cashtokens bitcoin cash podcasts in november general protocols introduced general protocols spaces a xtwitter centered podcast with open discussion about all the latest developments on bitcoin cash gp uploaded their first 10 spaces to a youtube playlist and started making shorts for the different episodes to make the content more accessible the bitcoin cash podcast also stayed super consistent getting to its 100th episode in december featuring roger ver here a screenshot of some of the latest episodes of the year november also marked half a year since the cashtokens activation date heres a recap video of the ecosystem at that time fastpaced innovation november 28th end of november i successfully completed flipstarter funding for cashonize which was already 11 months old at that point but was still a hobby project the objective of the crowfunder was a complete rewrite of the wallet a bunch of new features and releasing a mobile version of the wallet innovation in the cashonize wallet took a big leap forward early december when jim released his new protocol cashrpc and implemented it into cashonize the goal of cashrpc is to improve the security of walletconnect by allowing wallets to recognize smart contract templates and to allow for more complex dapps there was also huge innovation with regards to cashscript pat succesfully developed great debug tooling for the bitcoin cash smart contract language this allows smart contract developers to much easier understand what is going wrong when their smart contract transactions fail it gives them a debug report of on which line the error is it gives the develope a custom error message for the failing check and allows to easily check intermediate values either by using consolelog statement or checking the stack trace in the bitauthide environment rise walletconnect apps early december the second item from the paytaca roadmap got completed instead of building a 2nd cashtokens marketplace they made an app for easy tokencreation called cashtokens studio the application released with both wallectconenct and paytacaconnect middecember tapswap also added wallet connect to main site this change was requested a lot by users who up until that point had to use a special beta version of tapswap to be able to connect their cashonize or zapit wallet to the marketplace dapp this further integrated the different pieces of the ecosystem making it much more accessible and convenient for users additionally in december there also was the release of early settlement in the bch bull platform a long awaited featured allowing users to exit their futures contract before the final settlement time cashconnect bch guru the launch of the beta of the bch guru price prediction platfrom was announced for january 5th of the new year following a private alpha period the beta platform has 3 assets btc eth and bch and allows 2 players to play each other in a game of predicting future usd prices for the beta users can only bet with furu tokens the fungible token of the guru project which was airdropped to all bch guru holders based on their collection rarity earlier in the year the bch guru platform uses cashconnect to let a wallet connect to their more advanced smart contract cashconnect is the new cashrpc protocol with walletconnect as the transport layer so it uses some components similar to the walletconnect specification pat designed but it uses libauth templates under the hood december 29th cashconnect got merged into mainline cashonize from jims fork in preparation for the upcoming bch guru app which was planning to use the new feature and with that the year 2023 got concluded with high anticipation for 2024 year in review 2023 was the best year for bch todate there was a huge amount of technical innovation and catching up with the rest of the cryptoecosystem bch now has tooling to easily do an nft mint it now has walletconnect to let users interact with dapps cashscript the bchspecific smart contract language saw multiple major upgrades throughout the year we saw multiple amm dexes launch on cashtokens and with tapswap we saw a first noncustodial marketplace for cashtokens and last but not least we made industry wide innovation with cashconnect that can recognize smart contract templates something the much more mature defi ecosystems dont even have maybe most important of all we see the beginning of a nicely integrated ecosystem were each piece builds upon the next and where we squeeze the most out of our limited resources in 2023 we saw a very unified community all working towards innovation on cashtokens in a collaborative manner aiming to grow the pie as a whole cashtokens might well turn out to be the turning of the tide for bch from losing and hardship to winning and leading pricewise the year 2023 was also good starting 2023 at only roughly 100 and ending the year at 260 bch however zooming out bch started the 2022 at 440 and had traded above 600 just two months earlier so the long term trend is still very bad the anticipation is there for the bch miner halving less than 100 days into 2024 to have a great positive impact on the price

2024-01-09,16:59:22,cryptocurrency,TSLA,Tesla,indian crypto exchanges benefit from finance ministry notice funds coming in from foreign crypto exchanges what is this all about disclaimer does this look like financial advice you are right it isnt treat it so do your own research dyor is not a fad but an important element of the cryptoverse do keep that in mind indian finance ministrys showcause notice to international crypto exchanges thats the tldr a couple of weeks back the indian finance ministry issued a show cause notice to international crypto exchanges like kucoin gateio mexc binance and more for not complying with indian regulations there was a chance that the websites would be blocked in india and that saw the flight of indian citizens funds from these international exchanges all the influx of funds was directed towards local indian exchanges which were following the financial intelligence units fiu regulations as such local exchanges like coindcx wazirx buyucoin and others saw a surge in deposits not only the deposits but also trades witnessed a surge such movement of funds would likely continue unless the international exchanges follow the fius norms and respect the indian regulatory framework regulations in the indian crypto space everything other than tldr following indias call for a global framework for cryptorelated financial interactions at the g20 summit india developed its own local financial intelligence units fiu norms for regulation the indian crypto exchanges were largely complying with these norms while the international exchanges werent the call for the same was made to ensure nefarious actors do not play in the crypto space hurting the indian users on december 28 2023 the finance ministry issued a showcause notice to nine international exchanges including binance kucoin gateio mexc and the likes the intention it is supposed was to make these exchanges comply with the domestic norms and regulations there were also murmurs that these exchange websites could be blocked in india if they did not comply with the norms the news set the indian crypto users in motion withdrawing their assets from the named international exchanges to indian exchanges this resulted in an increase in deposits of over 2000 in coindcx 250 in wazirx and similar numbers in other exchanges in india even small exchanges witnessed a surge in deposits so the indian exchanges complying with the laid down norms and regulations benefited the most not only was there a surge in deposits but also transactions and trades but why international exchanges when there are indian exchanges heres why why international exchanges when there are domestic ones the reason there is no rocket science as to why it is a matter of convenience and availability lets take an example of stock markets and then we will come to crypto markets if i wanted to buy shares of tesla i would necessarily have to buy them from nyse as tesla is not listed on nse in india so based on the stocks i want to buy i may register with exchanges beyond indias borders x200b the same logic applies to crypto exchanges while the main coins like btc eth xrp and likes would be available across exchanges some specific tokens like moons or donut of reddit would not be available everywhere so if i as an investor wanted to buy moons or donuts i would necessarily have to look at international exchanges since these are not available on the indian exchanges so the basic premise is the ability of investors and traders to find the coinstokens of their choice in this endeavor they end up going to international exchanges this is true for all markets and countries what next in the pursuit of norms and regulations such hickups are expected not only in india but in every country in the world it is a passing phase where exchanges learn to comply with international norms and regulations in doing so they really become international crypto exchanges so we are in a phase where we will have more and more truly international crypto exchanges this is a good place to be and we as users can only benefit from the move news courtesy economic times india dated 6th january 2024

2024-11-06,13:38:41,Investing_Discussion,TSLA,Tesla,why donald trumps return could boost demand for robots a longterm investment opportunity hey everyone with donald trump making a return i think theres more to consider than just the political drama specifically his policies could have a huge ripple effect on the labor market especially in the service industry trumps stance on illegal immigration means we could see a stronger push to reduce undocumented workers which would lead to an even bigger labor shortage in industries like hospitality food service and logistics if fewer workers are available companies will likely have to fill that gapand robots could be the answer thats where robotics companies come in especially ones like tesla richtech robotics rr and serve robotics tesla is aiming to make waves with its humanoid robots while serve robotics focuses on lastmile delivery solutions in urban areas but lets talk about richtech robotics rr in particular because theyve already got robots deployed and working in realworld environments addressing exactly the kind of labor shortages were talking about rrs service robots are already in use across various industries from restaurants to healthcare facilities and theyre receiving high praise from clients for their reliability and efficiency their tech isnt just conceptualits been tested and proven which gives them a solid foothold as demand grows and then theres elon musk himself if he ends up being involved in government restructuring it wouldnt be surprising to see him push for more automation within federal jobs too given his passion for robotics and ai if musk advocates for more robots in both private and public sectors we could see a huge surge in the robotics industry overall sure the attention is still on djt stocks and crypto as shortterm plays riding the trump wave but i see robotics as a sector with way more potential for sustainable growth for those of us looking for longterm positions robots could be the steady play were after especially as the tech gets better and companies like rrserve continue proving their value in realworld applications anyone else seeing this as a big moment to get into robotics stocks for the long haul
2024-11-05,06:52:12,Investing_Discussion,TSLA,Tesla,why is elon musk all in on trump ive been thinking a lot about elon musk latelyspecifically why hes suddenly backing trump so openly if youve been following musks moves for a while you know the guy isnt exactly one to play it safe hes all about doing things his own way whether its launching rockets or making electric cars cool but aligning himself with someone as controversial as trump thats a pretty bold move even for him so whats going on here for starters musk has always had a soft spot for people who like to mess with the system think about it the dude practically made a career out of disrupting industries tesla challenged the car industry spacex took on nasa and now hes getting into the whole ai game which will probably shake things up in ways we cant even imagine yet trump for all his flaws is also a disruptor he didnt play by the usual political rules and thats probably something musk respects theres a kind of kinship therea shared desire to break away from the traditional how things are supposed to be done its like musk sees trump as someone who can push back against the establishment just like musk has done in his own way but honestly i think theres more to it than just a love for chaos if we look at musks business model its clear he thrives in a lessregulated world under trump we saw massive tax cuts and deregulationthings that allowed musks companies to thrive less red tape means faster innovation and thats exactly what musk is all about hes always pushing for faster development especially when it comes to tesla and spacex so backing trump now might just be a calculated move especially if he thinks another term will lead to more of the same an environment that favors tech innovation and business growth but heres the kicker musk is no stranger to playing the media game think about itevery time he tweets something outrageous its like the whole world stops to pay attention trumps the same way both of them have this uncanny ability to command attention and im sure musk realizes that aligning with trump keeps him in the headlines its good for his brand its good for business people love controversy and musk just like trump knows how to give the media what it craves the more attention musk gets the more likely it is that his projects get the support and funding they need another layer here might be musks frustration with silicon valleys leftleaning culture hes made no secret of his beef with the regions growing political correctness which he sees as stifling innovation supporting trumpwho represents everything silicon valley isntmight be musks way of sticking it to the very place that helped build his empire its like hes saying im not playing by your rules anymore in a weird way supporting trump could be musks way of rejecting the silicon valley elite that he thinks has become out of touch with reality and then lets not forget the personal side of things musk and trump have had interactions over the years and while theyre not exactly best buds theres a mutual respect there trump has always praised musks ventures and musk has shown some admiration for trumps business success it might be as simple as thattwo big personalities who despite their differences can respect what the other has achieved so why is musk all in on trump i dont think its as simple as just politics i think its about seeing trump as a vehicle for disrupting the system securing a businessfriendly environment and maintaining his place in the media spotlight musks always looking ahead and if he thinks trump can help him shape the future the way he wants it to be shapedless regulation more innovation more space for the private sector to do its thingthen supporting him makes perfect sense at the end of the day though i think musk is just doing what he does best betting on what he believes will push humanity forward even if its not always the most popular choice and yeah in typical musk fashion its bound to ruffle some feathers but when has he ever cared about that

after a judge ruled the tech behemoth was illegally dominating search another trial kicks off this time in virginia targeting googles stronghold on digital advertising technology the lawsuit claims google has an unlawful monopoly over tools that buy and sell digital adstools that are essential for keeping online publishers afloat the case googles adtech monopoly the trial expected to last several weeks aims to determine whether googles control of both the buyside and sellside of the adtech ecosystem is crushing competition the justice department backed by 17 states argues that googles practices have locked out rivals with advertisers and publishers feeling forced to use its tools theyre demanding google shed its ad manager which generated 368 million in profits from 74 billion in revenue in 2020 alone this isnt the first time google has been hit with monopoly claims a federal judge recently ruled that google illegally maintained dominance in search but this case could potentially cut deeper if google loses it might have to sell off key parts of its advertising business which is crucial to alphabets overall revenue78 of its 307 billion annual earnings come from advertising googles defense the market has changed in response google claims the justice department is stuck in the past focusing on outdated desktop advertising models while consumer attention has shifted to mobile apps social media and streaming platforms like tiktok and peacock googles legal team insists that the adtech space is more competitive than ever with alternatives like microsoft and amazon gaining ground but the trial has already hit some bumps for google the company is facing scrutiny for allegedly deleting internal chat messages relevant to the case something the judge

revising its proposal to raise capital requirements for banks following pushback from politicians and the banking industry who warned it could hurt lending and the economy cpi tomorrow inflation data holds the key this week the federal reserve is set to get its final look at inflation numbers before its next policy meeting on september 18 with interest rate cuts all but certain the key question now is how big will the cut be the answer hinges on two upcoming inflation reportsthe consumer price index cpi and the producer price index ppi these reports are expected to clarify the feds next move especially after fridays jobs report provided little guidance cpi ppi the deciding factors on wednesday the bureau of labor statistics will release augusts cpi report followed by the ppi on thursday economists are predicting a 02 monthly increase for both headline and core cpi bringing annual inflation rates to 26 and 32 respectively the ppi is expected to mirror these figures while the feds preferred inflation measure is the personal consumption expenditures pce index this weeks cpi and ppi readings will still play a crucial role in determining the size of the upcoming rate cut the debate is now centered on whether the fed will opt for a modest 25basispoint cut or go bigger with a 50basispoint reduction futures markets currently favor a quarterpoint cut with odds hovering around 71 however a strongerthanexpected inflation reading could push the fed toward a more aggressive move economists like dean baker cofounder of the center for economic and policy research believe inflation data should be favorable for at least a small cut shifting focus from inflation to jobs while inflation has been the feds main concern for months the focus is now turning toward the labor market hiring has slowed significantly with nonfarm payroll gains averaging just 135000 per month since april down from 255000 in the prior five months job openings have also declined raising fears that the labor market is weakening this shift has increased expectations that the fed will begin cutting rates sooner rather than later starting with a baby step at the next meeting whats next after this weeks inflation reports all eyes will be on the feds september 18 meeting if the data shows more progress in curbing inflation the central bank may lean toward a larger rate cut but even if the fed starts small markets expect more cuts to follow with a possible halfpoint reduction in november and another in december as the fed navigates these murky waters the balance between taming inflation and supporting a cooling labor market will guide its next moves on the horizon tomorrow inflations about to take center stage again tomorrow we get the august consumer price index cpi reportaka the data that shows how much more or less expensive life has gotten over the past year while the fed has plenty of tools to gauge inflation cpi is the star of the showespecially core cpi which leaves out the drama of volatile food and energy prices economists are penciling in a 02 rise for august same as julys bump if that holds it would push annual inflation down from 29 to 26 core inflation is also expected to clock in at 32 yearoveryear if these numbers land as predicted the fed will probably have the green light to trim rates by 25 basis points at next weeks meeting earnings manchester united

2024-08-06,12:11:54,Investing_Discussion,AAPL,Apple,question new to trading need help understanding a recent order hi super new to actively trading and investing and pretty bad at understanding money in general i got a bunch of stock from aapl through years of being an employee and tried to sell some because im really tight on money right now and this is my only source sold 36 shares didnt realize it was saturday and not friday like a fool so i had to wait until monday morning for the sale to execute in the app etrade and thats when the value dipped thing is that when the order was executed the value was only roughly 5 less than when i originally made the order the order went through at 945 on monday for 199 so the estimated net proceeds was a little above 7k and all the history in the app shows me that number but i got a notification at 4 am tuesday that the order was settled and only 54k was put into my account capital gains status was long term where did the rest of the money go tax fees i cant find anything in the app that shows any paper trail or explanation and google isnt really helping i dont know where this nearly 25 shortfall is coming from i havent heard of this happening to any of my friends selling their stock and the only person i know who might know is horrible at explaining i am at least good at math so if i could get at least something i can google to understand and then run the numbers myself so i can verify why the amount is supposed to be that much it would be much appreciated tldr sold stock expecting one profit different amount was deposited into account no amount of digging through transaction history order history or documents available in app provide any numbers that explain why edit managed to reach out after a few transfers over the phone they arent sure but the most likely thing is tax withholding because of a discrepancy in my name on file vs the name my employer provided when making the account wont know until 23 business days from now after sending in a bunch of identification docs and forms will keep updated

2024-07-27,13:46:35,Investing_Discussion,MC.PA,LVMH,why kering has a questionable competitive advantage kering is a large french luxury holding similar to companies such as lvmh and richemont that focuses on luxury goods kering is not a standalone brand but a luxury group with many wellknown luxury brands see examples below highquality fashion and leather goods jewelry eyewear porcelain beauty kering is therefore a global luxury group that manages the development of a range of renowned brands in fashion leather goods and jewelry the company was founded in 1963 and is known for its luxury fashion and accessories brands such as gucci saint laurent and balenciaga in this piece we will discover how kering was founded how the company has developed over the years and which key moments in the companys history have contributed to its current success why kerings moat is questionable kering a prominent player in the luxury goods market has built its reputation based on brands like gucci saint laurent and balenciaga however despite its impressive portfolio and strategic acquisitions kerings competitive advantage appears to be on shaky ground just take a look at its returns over the past 5 years the luxury market is defined by several unique characteristics brand recognition customer loyalty heritage these elements are of the utmost importance for establishing and maintaining a durable competitive advantage kerings strategy largely depends on taking advantage of these intangible assets across its various brands however the strength of kerings competitive advantage varies greatly among its brands kerings primary competitive advantage lies in its strong brands but not all of them are equally robust gucci which accounts for a significant portion of kerings revenue has recently shown signs of weakening brand strength while gucci remains one of the most recognizable names in luxury fashion its appeal has been declining as evidenced by a drop in sales and market share which we talk about more in depth in our kering research report the brand value of gucci amounted to approximately 178 billion dollars in 2023 a slight decrease of around 300 million dollars compared to the previous year1footnote1 just to show how strong of a brand gucci still is 1 gucci is one of the top luxury brands globally ranking high among its peers interbrand has it ranked fourth in the world behind louis vuitton chanel and hermès 2 it generates over 10 billion in annual revenue with more than 500 stores in over 50 countries 3 gucci leads luxury brands on social media boasting over 40 million followers on instagram 4 celebrities like beyoncé rihanna and jennifer lopez frequently wear gucci 5 gucci often features in popular films and tv shows highlighting its iconic status so whats guccis and kerings problem problem 1 not the same level of luxury compared to other luxury giants like lvmh and hermès kerings brands particularly gucci do not exhibit the same level of resilience and customer loyalty hermès is known for being exclusive and luxurious they have a sizable base of devoted customers who are unaffected by the economy the popularity of gucci is changing which raises questions about its longterm viability as a premium luxury brand problem 2 economies of scale are not the same strength one of kerings advantages is its ability to achieve economies of scale and synergies through its portfolio of brands the company can negotiate better rates for advertising marketing real estate and other operational expenses benefiting from its size however these economies of scale are not exclusive to kering and competitors such as lvmh richemont or even hermès also benefit from these advantages often more effectively problem 3 not all brands are performing well kerings strategy of allowing each brand to maintain its unique identity while benefiting from shared resources is a good one yet the execution appears inconsistent for instance while saint laurent ysl and bottega veneta have shown some growth other brands within kerings portfolio such as balenciaga and alexander mcqueen have not performed as well dragging down the overall performance kerings significant stock price decline by 60 reflects the markets growing skepticism about the companys ability to sustain its competitive edge and the future of its flagship brand gucci the key question is whether gucci can regain its position as a leading luxury brand or if it is destined to become merely a premium brand if gucci fails to reclaim its luxury status it risks being perceived as a premium brand rather than a luxury one this shift could be disastrous is gucci capable of reclaiming its luxury status or will it have to contend with a premium future please let us know what you think want more of these articles you can find all of them for free on our substack the dutch investors

2024-03-07,05:57:03,Investing_Discussion,AAPL,Apple,what do you think about my strategy hi i would like to hear your opinions on my investment strategy to provide some context im 19 years old and about to start investing ive developed the following strategy investing in stocks like apple microsoft alphabet google etc exclusively through an sp 500 etf this means that throughout the duration of my investment i wont directly invest in these companies as they are already predominantly included in the sp 500 etf additionally i plan to implement a dividend strategy focusing on market leaders present for at least 30 years such as cocacola lvmh pepsico walmart etc i intend to invest in each leader based on its sector what do you think of this strategy which in summary involves buying sp 500 etfs and complementing them with stocks of wellestablished companies for at least 30 years paying increasing dividends each year in my opinion this strategy seems interesting as it allows me to benefit from the growth of major companies through sp 500 etfs while complementing them with dividendpaying stocks from renowned companies it avoids direct stock picking on major american companies while capitalizing on their growth furthermore this approach will enable me to reinvest dividends in each major company such as lvmh pepsico etc of course as its a strategy i plan to adopt it seems perfect for me however id appreciate feedback from more experienced investors to identify any potential longterm flaws

2024-01-25,19:39:19,Investing_Discussion,AAPL,Apple,one common mistake of a novice trader lets imagine the mindset of beginners beginners want to earn quickly a lot and with minimal effort and most likely we know from our experience they will be quite fearful so they will choose those instruments that are wellknown and have a good reputation these will probably be stocks of companies such as google meta amazon apple how will beginners add companies to their portfolio lets specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100300 dollars of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now this means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them what is wrong with that the point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position what does good or bad timing mean in investing for 1015 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times but if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading it is very important to choose the right moment because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more of course for the sake of simplicity lets consider 2 companies meta and aapl both of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading but you should not buy both companies now if you take them for a short term the fact is that meta and aapl stocks are at their alltime highs right now they have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line there will always come moments of correction and if you buy their stocks now you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times thats why its important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly
