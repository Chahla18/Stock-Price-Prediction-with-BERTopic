2024-01-05,2024-01-05 23:25:05,TSLA,Tesla,pennystocks,what is the difference in profits from penny stocks compared to expensive stocks if they both went up by 10 in a month in share value and you have invested the same amount in both what is the difference in profits from penny stocks compared to expensive stocks if they both went up by 10 in a month in share value and you have invested the same amount in both [TITLE_END] edit solved answered. thanks new to trading. so i don t know if this question even makes sense. so here s the scenario if a penny stocks company increases it s shares value by 10 in 1 month. and if a big company like tesla increases it s shares value by 10 in 1 month. and i ve spent 100 in both. shouldn t my return profit be the same won t i have 110 end of month in both scenarios even if their shares value are very different the percent increase is the same. so my return on investment is the same so apart from the potential for quick big percentages increase why isn t it a good idea to spend the same money on a big company which is always increasing it s value every year instead of up and down like most penny stocks thanks in advance,difference profits penny stocks compared expensive stocks went 10 month share value invested difference profits penny stocks compared expensive stocks went 10 month share value invested [TITLE_END] edit solved answered. thanks new trading. don t know question makes sense. s scenario penny stocks company increases s shares value 10 1 month. big company like tesla increases s shares value 10 1 month. ve spent 100 both. shouldn t return profit won t 110 end month scenarios shares value different percent increase same. return investment apart potential quick big percentages increase isn t good idea spend money big company increasing s value year instead like penny stocks thanks advance,0

changes within the company and the race to launch the next major aigc innovation. currently openai s chatgpt has been huge success prompting each major technology company to release its own version. large technology companies have fully invested in the development of generative ai and various ai models have emerged such as meta llama 2 google s bard chatbot and gemini in addition generative ai allows artificial intelligence technology to develop bringing a historical turning point in the large scale adoption of machine learning. the new round of technological revolution initiated by generative ai is far beyond the imagination of ordinary people today which means that a huge historical opportunity is coming. from an application point of view various applications derived from generative ai are gradually trying to land in various industries including art generation text generation music generation and more complex tasks such as video generation and virtual reality environment generation. generative ai based knowledge base search text summary content or code creation takes productivity to a new stage. generative artificial intelligence is firmly top 1 in the current technology field and aigc represents a new trend of ai technology development. in the past traditional ai favored analytical capabilities but now ai is generating new content making a leap from perceptual understanding of the world to creating the world. according to the prediction of industry insiders from 2024 it will enter the era of generative ai applications and even become the 2.0 era of changing traditional industries. generated ai will contribute about $7 trillion to the global economy and increase the overall economic benefits of ai by about 50 percent according to data released by leading consultancy mckinsey. according to the top 10 strategic technology trends of 2024 released by global it research and consulting firm gartner by 2026 more than 80 of enterprises will be connected to generative ai or large models but the proportion is less than 5 at the beginning of 2023. companies began to compete in the ai field due to the rise of generative ai especially the application of large language model is fundamentally change the operation of technology industry industry technology is driven by ai into a new era this will prompt generative ai and industry model technology no longer limited to the boundary of the industry become an important strategic development direction of technology giants. in january microsoft released azure openai services by combining azure s enterprise capabilities with openai s generative ai model capabilities in march google opened the api of the ai big model palm and introduced generative ai into google s enterprise online collaboration platform google workspace. amazon entered generative ai a little later than microsoft and google but the company has not followed the two giants taking a new approach. according to the news amazon recently announced the launch of a number of blockbuster releases around the theme of reconstructing cloud infrastructure computing storage and enterprise generated ai to help cloud customers quickly realize digital transformation and improve the speed of enterprise generated ai innovation. in addition amazon has introduced five new amazon sagemaker features that make it easier and faster for enterprises to build train and deploy machine learning models that support a variety of generative ai usage scenarios enabling customers to easily integrate generative ai into their workflow. according to public information wimi hologram cloud is committed to cutting edge research and development in the field of artificial intelligence and constantly expands its application scope. it has excellent technical strength and rich experience in application scenarios. now generative ai is becoming a hot spot in the industry. wimi hologram cloud will use existing ai models and technical strength and use new aigc technology to empower various industries so as to provide more intelligent solutions and help vertical industries complete the development of digital intelligence so as to achieve comprehensive empowerment. the emergence of aigc is bringing disruptive changes to every industry leading all industries to an era of efficiency. it is foreseeable that aigc is both an important opportunity and an inevitable trend. with the continuous progress of artificial intelligence technology the capability and quality of aigc are also constantly improving. in the future the

[TITLE_END] to support more analysis like this please join r tradingedge as well as r trading. analysis yesterday we hit 4900 like a brick wall and got rejected a lot of algorithmic selling from that point brought us lower. looking at today vs yesterday we can see that the call resistance still sits at 4900 it hasn t rolled up yet to 4950 or above. we want to see the roll up of call resistance for us to be more bullish. in fact after 4900 got rejected yesterday we can see that traders bought a fair bit of puts 0dte. on february expiration we can see calls on 5000 and 4950 got sold and puts got bought. so positioning bit worse but still bullish. money flows are strong. if we look 0dte we can see big walls at 4880 as 0dte call resitance and 4845 as 0dte put resistance. these will act as sticky strikes but obviously they are just 0dte so they can be broken by strong volume from gdp data. qqq positioning more or less as it was. call resistance still at 430 which will act as a wall. iwm we are seeing some selling of calls as bond yields push higher. note that positioning today will be subject to the gdp print. a big surprise in either direction will clearly impact the market as it will impact bond yields dollar and the chance of rate cuts. we showed yesterday that the probability of march rate cuts has been directly driving dollar price action and in turn the equity market. we can see from the chart below that the reduction in rate cuts being priced was what directly correlated to the equity sell off. vix is pretty much sleeping at this point so this is a good thing to watch as the number of rate cuts being priced and equity markets are moving inversely. furthermore tesla will weigh on nasdaq a bit today. the report wasn t great. pointing to lower volume is not what investors want to be hearing but that is mostly because their team is working on launch of next gen vehicle or so they say. i do think that we have to remember that the stock was trading at 260 at the start of the year. it s already down 27 on that. i do think tesla goes lower but i am not as pessimistic as other people on reddit and social media. a quick look at china because china announced more supportive measures this time for the property sector. call volumes on china are flying after the announcement of stimulus measures this week. we can see that below. i did look at the option profile for fxi and saw a fair bit of selling of puts at 21. positioning is looking much better. mainland investors aren t chasing this rally though but area actually selling it. whilst we can see more of a

china we can see aud risk reversal points up. traders fully expecting 0.67 right now as stimulus in china helps australian trade. data lede ifo report for germany business climate was 85.2 lowest

generates revenue on commissions. agency revenue is when booking makes a reservation for a customer but does not facilitate payment the supplier will follow up with the customer for payment. merchant revenue is when booking acts as a merchant i.e. collect payment and remits payment to supplier. bookings earns commission on both of these categories. merchant revenue is catching up and increasing its percentage as a proportion of total revenue and although this doesn t negatively impact booking in regards to its position in the industry it does negatively impact their margins. operating margins 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 42.2 40.5 37.92 28.18 36.48 36.7 35.48 9.28 22.78 we can see that as the merchant category increases as a proportion of sales operating margins are decreasing. merchant revenue incurs additional expenses. advertising other is revenue mainly earned by kayak for its meta search platform this platform lists hotel chains flights etc on its website. i am going to disregard this segment because google flights does the same thing so i am estimating no growth here. some people view google as a competitor to booking and they do compete against kayak. however google benefits booking s agency and merchant business since google refers a lot of people to bookings platforms. google is ultimately an advertising business they don t make reservations or facilitate payments. marketing expense as a of total revenue 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 35 34.6 32 32.9 34.1 36.2 35.4 35 booking spends a lot on marketing and a lot of this spend is performance marketing on google. room nights booked 2022 2021 2020 2019 896 591 355 845 what i like about this data is that room nights booked in 2022 is higher than 2019 which was the record prior to covid. room nights have been increasing significantly in geographical areas which has lower average daily rates compared to areas like europe and the u.s. this also impacts their margins. competitors bookings mix of room nights for hotels and alternative accommodation 2022 2021 2020 2019 hotels motels resorts 70 71 71 alternative 30 29 29 airbnb the way i am thinking about this is 70 of bookings accommodations are in hotels and motels and airbnb mainly generate revenue from homes holiday houses etc. this is only 30 of bookings business which they list as alternative. although these two companies compete i don t think it will affect booking if airbnb continues to grow since they don t specialise in hotel accommodations. i am curious to know your thoughts about this. website traffic expedia 88.68 website traffic in the u.s. airbnb 71.54 website traffic in the u.s booking 10.86 website traffic in the u.s most of bookings website traffic is concentrated in europe whereas expedia and airbnb is concentrated in the u.s. i believe this has other implications especially when i compare booking with expedia that has a business model that is almost identical. most of the hotel chains in the u.s are very popular marriott holiday inn hilton hampton inn and hyatt to name a few. they have their own loyalty programs and big marketing and merchandising campaigns and customers often seek these hotels out directly although they are listed on expedia as well. since they are popular they have bargaining power and can request lower commissions to be listed on an ota. since expedia is heavily concentrated in the united states this has an impact on their margins. most of bookings hotel suppliers are outside of the u.s. and these are often smaller independent chains that rely more heavily on an ota. expedia operating margins 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 10.2 3 29.4 8 7 6.6 i think this explains why expedia s margins are a lot lower than booking despite similar business models. industry ota industry estimates suggest it will grow to over $1 trillion at the end of 2030. it is currently at $521 billion. estimated growth is just over 10 . intrinsic value estimate historical

and 6 in yrs 6 10 discount rate of 10 and terminal value of 20. the growth rates are estimated because of the industry growth projections and bookings position in the market. also the 5 year previous growth rates for booking was 8 which was the lowest compared to my 1 3 7 and 9 years growth rates so i went with that. 8 is a lower growth rate than the industry growth projections and i wanted to be conservative especially since the fcf in the current year is at record highs. i always like putting a lower growth rate in the latter half because it is a lot harder to estimate. the discount rate is high however my style has always been to make fewer bets for higher returns and i am happy being patient until those opportunities arrive. this gave me an intrinsic value of $4 296. i try and go a bit

2024-02-01,2024-02-01 21:16:11,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",pennystocks,consider li ft power as a potential value play in the lithium mining space consider li ft power as a potential value play in the lithium mining space [TITLE_END] as countries scramble to wrestle china s 60 stranglehold on the global lithium market a new project hidden in canada for 40 years and can be spotted from the sky could be a significant lithium breakthrough in north america take a look at this rock. x200b li ft power s ceo francis macdonald shows off this lithium rock he picked up in the northwest territories canada.. owned by li ft power for most lithium companies around the world they dig dozens if not hundreds of meters into the earth s crust to find this rock. not the one this man is holding. this specific rock not only contains some of the highest grade lithium around this rock could be picked up right off the ground. yes like any old pebble in fact there s over 158 400m2 area of land that is bursting with this rock. so much so there are kilometers of it just sitting on top of the earth. it s so large just look for yourself on google maps x200b you can see this lithium deposit from this aerial view. see those white specks stretching over 2 kilometers that stuff can power a tesla and it s there for the taking. this unique project in the northwest territories canada is called the yellowknife lithium project. discovered in the 1970 s but hidden from the world until today once owned by exxonmobil in the 80s it s sat dormant and relatively untouched for the last 36 years. until now. when a successful gold finder from the $47b newmont mining company francis macdonald stumbled on a major arbitrage in the lithium market. due to his experience in gold mining he knew you needed 500 000 1.5 million meters of drilling to start a gold project. and the costs are enormous. for copper mining it s 200 000 1 million meters of required drilling. for lithium it s only 50 000 meters of drilling . that means less money time and effort to find out how much metal is in the ground. not only that there are already over 536 active gold producing mines running right now. active producing lithium mines a paltry 54. that s not enough. at the moment there are 1. record breaking demand for electric vehicles ... and lithium ion batteries. plus 2. a looming lithium shortage to hit as early as 2025 according to cnbc. francis took his geology and mining knowledge and founded li ft power. the company is only two years old while potentially sitting on a fascinating lithium deposit in north america. li ft power trades publicly on the us otcqx lifff li ft s a company bursting with lithium potential literally coming out of the ground. x200b li ft currently is drilling to discover how much lithium is here why hasn t yellowknife been drilled for lithium if it could be one of the greatest deposits in north america extracting any resource from gold to copper to lithium takes time to permit and develop the mine site money to do so companies like exxonmobil and individuals barely touched yellowknife for almost a century as lithium wasn t as profitable to get out of the ground. only recently have ev sales picked up lithium prices soared and then stabilized and the demand for lithium ion batteries taken off. it s only now as we face geopolitical risks and coming lithium shortages does it finally makes sense to put more shovels into the ground. that s the opportunity li ft power and its founders see. over 50 of the outstanding shares of li ft power are owned by the founders and early investors. early li ft investors poured in as much as $15 million dollars each into the company to acquire the yellowknife project and start defining how much lithium is in the ground. that money hasn t gone to pay out bonuses or waste. francis the ceo is plowing most of the cash into fast tracking yellowknife by drilling to determine how much lithium is there. remember this deposit has lithium containing rock that can be seen on the surface. now it s drilling down 200 300 meters and determining how big this project really is. we re hitting on 80 90 of our drill holes the ceo says. meaning 80 90 of drill tests locate more lithium. by mid 2024 li ft should know how much lithium they re holding. when you hear about car companies partnering up with mines now ford pre purchased one third of the output of a lithium mine in 2022 gm invested over $650 million bucks into a lithium mine in 2020 volkswagen is seeking to create what former ceo herbert diess has called a full ecosystem of suppliers from lithium extraction to the assembly of batteries in spain we ll need 78 new mines by 2035 to accommodate total demand but few mines are under development and existing mines are not scaling up lithium production. also lithium mines take 10 years to bring online. so if the mine is not already under development it s too late. which is why massive shortfalls are already being predicted. under the best case scenario the lithium shortage in three years will be as much as the entire demand was in 2022. to avoid the impending crisis ev manufacturers are taking matters into their own hands. in a rare move they re getting involved in lithium mining itself. what s unfolding is an escalating no holds barred brawl for lithium supply. consider volvo which is talking with the biggest mining companies in the world about buying a stake in their operations. not for a profit but just to have access to lithium. volkswagen s ceo scott keogh echoes this sentiment we are not going to become a mining company. but certainly we will get significantly closer. or ford which pre purchased 33 of the lithium output of a new mine in nevada last year. a few months after that gm invested $650 million in a lithium mine also in nevada. gm director of purchasing tanya skilton predicts that the industry will be divided into winners and losers companies with minerals for electrified dreams will succeed. the rest are toast. it s after feasibility this type of investor interest really picks up both with the stock and the potential vendors who desperately need more high grade lithium. why once li ft discovers how much lithium they can get and the way to extract it economically companies and investors start watering at the mouth. an example is tesla was rumored to be in talks to buy sigma lithium the massive lithium project in south america for around $3 4 billion. that company kept updating their feasibility and reserve size to be bigger and bigger tesla was interested to pounce. how big is the potential lithium motherlode inside yellowknife note modelling a deposit has a lot of variables and risk. and that s the job of seasoned analysts to determine. tesla was interested in buying sigma lithium as mentioned. today sigma is a $4 billion dollar lithium company in brazil. their entire business centers around their one lithium project grota do cirilo. the mine s already up running and producing as they started working on it in 2012. sigma s grota do cirilo is estimated to hold between 85 and 100 million metric tonnes of lithium in their mine. what about yellowknife according to francis the ceo he and his team are more than halfway through drilling to determine the actual tonnage. sigma is further along and now producing up to $450 million in free cash flow from their lithium output. sigma s stock skyrocketed over 1 350 as lithium demand and prices soared of course past returns are no guarantee of future returns. x200b taking a further look lift s yellowknife lithium deposits are in yellow and sigma s groto do cirolo deposits are in green both at the same scale on these maps. x200b let s look at another major lithium discovery patriot battery metals... 2.5 years ago they were worth around $10m. today they re a $1.25 billion dollar company but haven t pulled an ounce of lithium out of the ground yet. patriot battery metals project is called corvette. and it s currently heralded as one of the largest lithium mining deposits in the americas. they show 109 million metric tonnes of lithium ore. the project is still years from producing lithium revenue worth over $1 billion they ve simply defined how much lithium they have in the ground. li ft power aims to have a resource estimate done in the next 8 months and will be able to share their final numbers. if 100 million metric tonnes proves correct li ft power could end up with a significant lithium deposit in the americas. the top 4 lithium projects in the americas are owned by billion dollar companies as of this writing one large owner albemarle is worth over $16 billion. they own multiple projects globally. take a look x200b yellowknife has the potential to surpass the size of these billion dollar sites including its neighbor patriot battery metals. meaning two of the largest deposits in north america are quietly tucked away in canada. yet at the moment canada is a rounding error on the total lithium producers in the world. x200b australia leads the pack in lithium production by a wide margin followed by members of the lithium triangle chile and argentina. then of course china. canada is not even at 3 while australia reigns at over 46 . it s not a shock if canada begins making strides higher especially in the mining space. canada is already a top 5 producer of uranium diamonds gold platinum titanium and other resource metals. mining is in its dna. in canada thanks to the ice age ending only 25 000 years ago the lithium deposits are easier to get to and not as damaged. the glaciers also polished the landscape making beautiful pristine deposits at the surface in areas like yellowknife. not only that many canadian suppliers are not affiliated with china china is a major geopolitical concern in the lithium space. a big reason being they got to the lithium first. their quest for more evs before global adoption meant they snatched up mines all over the world. x200b china itself produces only 17 of the world s raw lithium. but it has managed to wrap its tentacles around every corner of the lithium market. it even has the lithium refining market cornered 65 of the world s lithium chemicals are produced in china. for example australia produces about half of the world s raw lithium but it s almost all owned by china a chinese lithium company owns a large stake in greenbushes the australian lithium reserve that is the largest in the world the second largest lithium reserve in the world also in australia is underwritten by ganfeng lithium... a chinese company. nearly 60 of the world s known reserves of lithium can be found inside a triangle that intersects the borders of three countries chile argentina and bolivia. x200b the lithium triangle holds most of the lithium reserves and china owns a large chunk of the ganfeng lithium paid $4 billion to become the second largest shareholder in sqm the largest lithium producer in chile. and in 2021 chinese companies bought three major lithium mines in argentina in deals worth $1.3 billion. most countries are trying to get out from the stranglehold of china s grasp on the lithium market. china s main gig is that they own over 60 of the lithium processing capacity. bloomberg projects they own up to 80 . which is quite alarming that s on top of owning the actual lithium in the ground inside multiple countries. the battle for lithium comes down to access to the lithium ion batteries. that s why the us is also seeking alternative lithium supplies. we need more lithium ion batteries to power electric vehicles. an electric car battery has between 30 and 60 kilos of lithium. it s estimated that by 2034 the us alone will need 500 000 metric tons of unrefined lithium a year for ev production. that s more than the global supply was in 2020. and by 2030 albemarle the world s largest lithium producer is projecting that 3.7 m metric tonnes of lithium will be needed. x200b that s a lot of lithium needed by mid century some experts project evs will be nearly 100 of the market supply for vehicles. boston consulting group predicts electric battery powered vehicles will surpass combustion engine vehicle sales as soon as 2028. x200b ev demand has picked up in just the last two years whether you believe gas powered cars are on their way out or not there s no denying ev sales are shooting upwards at the moment. everywhere you turn in north america there s a tesla driving by. and the numbers in china are breaking new records if the u.s. meets its 2030 target there will be more than 48 million evs on the road in just seven years. but it s not just the us trading in gas for lithium powered electrics europeans just started buying a ton more evs in 2021. x200b ev sales have tripled in just three years. china beat other countries to the lithium punch early because they suck up more supply of evs than anyone. more evs on the road more lithium required. to create one singular lithium ion battery to power a tesla you must process 25 000 pounds of brine for the lithium more is needed. the international energy agency an organization that tracks world energy usage says demand for lithium is growing faster than demand for any other metal or mineral they estimate that the global demand for lithium will increase more than tenfold by 2030 and potentially 50 times greater by 2040. check out where the demand graph is at the moment x200b we re in the early stages of lithium demand meaning experts predict a near 4x increase in lithium demand. 73 of that today comes from evs. another block is energy storage. keith phillips ceo of piedmont lithium projects we need 40x more lithium by the end of this decade. that may be overstating but either way the supply crunch is set to begin as early as 2025. and the gap will only widen as time passes. x200b we need more lithium being produced. well there are large players out there. the biggest in the world own projects in the china heavy lithium triangle. however getting the product out of the ground and scaling it is a problem. the problem big time companies like albemarle aren t hard rock lithium mining they use a technique called brining. brining is a process where instead of chipping away at rock and pulling out the lithium brining pumps ungodly amounts of water into lithium deposits extracts the solution then dries out the water to get the lithium salt remaining. here s the issue the brining evaporating cycle takes 2 years to complete in hard rock lithium mining you can pull the product out and it s commercial ready 6 weeks later. yellowknife has hard rock lithium sitting on the surface ready to be processed. little to no water evaporating is required. you can t scale brining operations without more land and tonnes and tonnes of more water. in chile brining has caused severe droughts. in northern chile an entire river was dried out due to water extraction and evaporation. rivers and lakes have disappeared one local told the news. to meet soaring demand we need more hard rock lithium miners. and with many countries turning their backs on chinese operations... canada has another opportunity to shine in the mining space. the lithium project that could be at the center of it all it s called yellowknife as mentioned. a project you can see from google maps for yourself it s that obvious yellowknife s owned by li ft power a two year old lithium mining company. francis macdonald the ceo has put together an expert team with multiple geologists and environmental officers. x200b a top tier team for a top tier lithium asset. insiders own 50 of the outstanding shares currently the company is valued around $198 million as of this writing. they hold $18 million just in cash. the stock trades for a mere $4 under the ticker symbol otcmkts lifff. the goal is to continue to develop the yellowknife project to become one of the top deposits in not just the americas but also the world. insiders still own 50 of the stock and aren t selling. shares only went public in may 2023. lithium prices currently sit at multi year lows. as we see a supply crunch with demand skyrocketing there s no telling how long lithium prices will stay this low. this low lithium price will discourage new lithium miners to develop. meaning if competitors don t start now they won t be extracting any new lithium before 2030. that could exacerbate the supply problem even further. by then it s too late even if lithium prices rebound. an investor is better to position themselves before lithium prices go up again. . investing in li ft power at just $4 is an easy way to gain exposure to lithium but also enjoy watching the potential unfold. their next major milestone for investors is finishing their drilling in early 2024 then a feasibility study by mid 2025. consider li ft power as a potential value play in the lithium mining space as a bonus li ft power also owns four other projects in canada. cali acquired with yellowknife near the yukon border rupert located near the james bay region of quebec pontax located also near the james bay region moyenne accessed via helicopter also located in james bay all 4 of these bonus assets are in pre production. most funding is going towards yellowknife. x200b,consider li ft power potential value play

2024-02-01,2024-02-01 21:16:11,TSLA,Tesla,pennystocks,consider li ft power as a potential value play in the lithium mining space consider li ft power as a potential value play in the lithium mining space [TITLE_END] as countries scramble to wrestle china s 60 stranglehold on the global lithium market a new project hidden in canada for 40 years and can be spotted from the sky could be a significant lithium breakthrough in north america take a look at this rock. x200b li ft power s ceo francis macdonald shows off this lithium rock he picked up in the northwest territories canada.. owned by li ft power for most lithium companies around the world they dig dozens if not hundreds of meters into the earth s crust to find this rock. not the one this man is holding. this specific rock not only contains some of the highest grade lithium around this rock could be picked up right off the ground. yes like any old pebble in fact there s over 158 400m2 area of land that is bursting with this rock. so much so there are kilometers of it just sitting on top of the earth. it s so large just look for yourself on google maps x200b you can see this lithium deposit from this aerial view. see those white specks stretching over 2 kilometers that stuff can power a tesla and it s there for the taking. this unique project in the northwest territories canada is called the yellowknife lithium project. discovered in the 1970 s but hidden from the world until today once owned by exxonmobil in the 80s it s sat dormant and relatively untouched for the last 36 years. until now. when a successful gold finder from the $47b newmont mining company francis macdonald stumbled on a major arbitrage in the lithium market. due to his experience in gold mining he knew you needed 500 000 1.5 million meters of drilling to start a gold project. and the costs are enormous. for copper mining it s 200 000 1 million meters of required drilling. for lithium it s only 50 000 meters of drilling . that means less money time and effort to find out how much metal is in the ground. not only that there are already over 536 active gold producing mines running right now. active producing lithium mines a paltry 54. that s not enough. at the moment there are 1. record breaking demand for electric vehicles ... and lithium ion batteries. plus 2. a looming lithium shortage to hit as early as 2025 according to cnbc. francis took his geology and mining knowledge and founded li ft power. the company is only two years old while potentially sitting on a fascinating lithium deposit in north america. li ft power trades publicly on the us otcqx lifff li ft s a company bursting with lithium potential literally coming out of the ground. x200b li ft currently is drilling to discover how much lithium is here why hasn t yellowknife been drilled for lithium if it could be one of the greatest deposits in north america extracting any resource from gold to copper to lithium takes time to permit and develop the mine site money to do so companies like exxonmobil and individuals barely touched yellowknife for almost a century as lithium wasn t as profitable to get out of the ground. only recently have ev sales picked up lithium prices soared and then stabilized and the demand for lithium ion batteries taken off. it s only now as we face geopolitical risks and coming lithium shortages does it finally makes sense to put more shovels into the ground. that s the opportunity li ft power and its founders see. over 50 of the outstanding shares of li ft power are owned by the founders and early investors. early li ft investors poured in as much as $15 million dollars each into the company to acquire the yellowknife project and start defining how much lithium is in the ground. that money hasn t gone to pay out bonuses or waste. francis the ceo is plowing most of the cash into fast tracking yellowknife by drilling to determine how much lithium is there. remember this deposit has lithium containing rock that can be seen on the surface. now it s drilling down 200 300 meters and determining how big this project really is. we re hitting on 80 90 of our drill holes the ceo says. meaning 80 90 of drill tests locate more lithium. by mid 2024 li ft should know how much lithium they re holding. when you hear about car companies partnering up with mines now ford pre purchased one third of the output of a lithium mine in 2022 gm invested over $650 million bucks into a lithium mine in 2020 volkswagen is seeking to create what former ceo herbert diess has called a full ecosystem of suppliers from lithium extraction to the assembly of batteries in spain we ll need 78 new mines by 2035 to accommodate total demand but few mines are under development and existing mines are not scaling up lithium production. also lithium mines take 10 years to bring online. so if the mine is not already under development it s too late. which is why massive shortfalls are already being predicted. under the best case scenario the lithium shortage in three years will be as much as the entire demand was in 2022. to avoid the impending crisis ev manufacturers are taking matters into their own hands. in a rare move they re getting involved in lithium mining itself. what s unfolding is an escalating no holds barred brawl for lithium supply. consider volvo which is talking with the biggest mining companies in the world about buying a stake in their operations. not for a profit but just to have access to lithium. volkswagen s ceo scott keogh echoes this sentiment we are not going to become a mining company. but certainly we will get significantly closer. or ford which pre purchased 33 of the lithium output of a new mine in nevada last year. a few months after that gm invested $650 million in a lithium mine also in nevada. gm director of purchasing tanya skilton predicts that the industry will be divided into winners and losers companies with minerals for electrified dreams will succeed. the rest are toast. it s after feasibility this type of investor interest really picks up both with the stock and the potential vendors who desperately need more high grade lithium. why once li ft discovers how much lithium they can get and the way to extract it economically companies and investors start watering at the mouth. an example is tesla was rumored to be in talks to buy sigma lithium the massive lithium project in south america for around $3 4 billion. that company kept updating their feasibility and reserve size to be bigger and bigger tesla was interested to pounce. how big is the potential lithium motherlode inside yellowknife note modelling a deposit has a lot of variables and risk. and that s the job of seasoned analysts to determine. tesla was interested in buying sigma lithium as mentioned. today sigma is a $4 billion dollar lithium company in brazil. their entire business centers around their one lithium project grota do cirilo. the mine s already up running and producing as they started working on it in 2012. sigma s grota do cirilo is estimated to hold between 85 and 100 million metric tonnes of lithium in their mine. what about yellowknife according to francis the ceo he and his team are more than halfway through drilling to determine the actual tonnage. sigma is further along and now producing up to $450 million in free cash flow from their lithium output. sigma s stock skyrocketed over 1 350 as lithium demand and prices soared of course past returns are no guarantee of future returns. x200b taking a further look lift s yellowknife lithium deposits are in yellow and sigma s groto do cirolo deposits are in green both at the same scale on these maps. x200b let s look at another major lithium discovery patriot battery metals... 2.5 years ago they were worth around $10m. today they re a $1.25 billion dollar company but haven t pulled an ounce of lithium out of the ground yet. patriot battery metals project is called corvette. and it s currently heralded as one of the largest lithium mining deposits in the americas. they show 109 million metric tonnes of lithium ore. the project is still years from producing lithium revenue worth over $1 billion they ve simply defined how much lithium they have in the ground. li ft power aims to have a resource estimate done in the next 8 months and will be able to share their final numbers. if 100 million metric tonnes proves correct li ft power could end up with a significant lithium deposit in the americas. the top 4 lithium projects in the americas are owned by billion dollar companies as of this writing one large owner albemarle is worth over $16 billion. they own multiple projects globally. take a look x200b yellowknife has the potential to surpass the size of these billion dollar sites including its neighbor patriot battery metals. meaning two of the largest deposits in north america are quietly tucked away in canada. yet at the moment canada is a rounding error on the total lithium producers in the world. x200b australia leads the pack in lithium production by a wide margin followed by members of the lithium triangle chile and argentina. then of course china. canada is not even at 3 while australia reigns at over 46 . it s not a shock if canada begins making strides higher especially in the mining space. canada is already a top 5 producer of uranium diamonds gold platinum titanium and other resource metals. mining is in its dna. in canada thanks to the ice age ending only 25 000 years ago the lithium deposits are easier to get to and not as damaged. the glaciers also polished the landscape making beautiful pristine deposits at the surface in areas like yellowknife. not only that many canadian suppliers are not affiliated with china china is a major geopolitical concern in the lithium space. a big reason being they got to the lithium first. their quest for more evs before global adoption meant they snatched up mines all over the world. x200b china itself produces only 17 of the world s raw lithium. but it has managed to wrap its tentacles around every corner of the lithium market. it even has the lithium refining market cornered 65 of the world s lithium chemicals are produced in china. for example australia produces about half of the world s raw lithium but it s almost all owned by china a chinese lithium company owns a large stake in greenbushes the australian lithium reserve that is the largest in the world the second largest lithium reserve in the world also in australia is underwritten by ganfeng lithium... a chinese company. nearly 60 of the world s known reserves of lithium can be found inside a triangle that intersects the borders of three countries chile argentina and bolivia. x200b the lithium triangle holds most of the lithium reserves and china owns a large chunk of the ganfeng lithium paid $4 billion to become the second largest shareholder in sqm the largest lithium producer in chile. and in 2021 chinese companies bought three major lithium mines in argentina in deals worth $1.3 billion. most countries are trying to get out from the stranglehold of china s grasp on the lithium market. china s main gig is that they own over 60 of the lithium processing capacity. bloomberg projects they own up to 80 . which is quite alarming that s on top of owning the actual lithium in the ground inside multiple countries. the battle for lithium comes down to access to the lithium ion batteries. that s why the us is also seeking alternative lithium supplies. we need more lithium ion batteries to power electric vehicles. an electric car battery has between 30 and 60 kilos of lithium. it s estimated that by 2034 the us alone will need 500 000 metric tons of unrefined lithium a year for ev production. that s more than the global supply was in 2020. and by 2030 albemarle the world s largest lithium producer is projecting that 3.7 m metric tonnes of lithium will be needed. x200b that s a lot of lithium needed by mid century some experts project evs will be nearly 100 of the market supply for vehicles. boston consulting group predicts electric battery powered vehicles will surpass combustion engine vehicle sales as soon as 2028. x200b ev demand has picked up in just the last two years whether you believe gas powered cars are on their way out or not there s no denying ev sales are shooting upwards at the moment. everywhere you turn in north america there s a tesla driving by. and the numbers in china are breaking new records if the u.s. meets its 2030 target there will be more than 48 million evs on the road in just seven years. but it s not just the us trading in gas for lithium powered electrics europeans just started buying a ton more evs in 2021. x200b ev sales have tripled in just three years. china beat other countries to the lithium punch early because they suck up more supply of evs than anyone. more evs on the road more lithium required. to create one singular lithium ion battery to power a tesla you must process 25 000 pounds of brine for the lithium more is needed. the international energy agency an organization that tracks world energy usage says demand for lithium is growing faster than demand for any other metal or mineral they estimate that the global demand for lithium will increase more than tenfold by 2030 and potentially 50 times greater by 2040. check out where the demand graph is at the moment x200b we re in the early stages of lithium demand meaning experts predict a near 4x increase in lithium demand. 73 of that today comes from evs. another block is energy storage. keith phillips ceo of piedmont lithium projects we need 40x more lithium by the end of this decade. that may be overstating but either way the supply crunch is set to begin as early as 2025. and the gap will only widen as time passes. x200b we need more lithium being produced. well there are large players out there. the biggest in the world own projects in the china heavy lithium triangle. however getting the product out of the ground and scaling it is a problem. the problem big time companies like albemarle aren t hard rock lithium mining they use a technique called brining. brining is a process where instead of chipping away at rock and pulling out the lithium brining pumps ungodly amounts of water into lithium deposits extracts the solution then dries out the water to get the lithium salt remaining. here s the issue the brining evaporating cycle takes 2 years to complete in hard rock lithium mining you can pull the product out and it s commercial ready 6 weeks later. yellowknife has hard rock lithium sitting on the surface ready to be processed. little to no water evaporating is required. you can t scale brining operations without more land and tonnes and tonnes of more water. in chile brining has caused severe droughts. in northern chile an entire river was dried out due to water extraction and evaporation. rivers and lakes have disappeared one local told the news. to meet soaring demand we need more hard rock lithium miners. and with many countries turning their backs on chinese operations... canada has another opportunity to shine in the mining space. the lithium project that could be at the center of it all it s called yellowknife as mentioned. a project you can see from google maps for yourself it s that obvious yellowknife s owned by li ft power a two year old lithium mining company. francis macdonald the ceo has put together an expert team with multiple geologists and environmental officers. x200b a top tier team for a top tier lithium asset. insiders own 50 of the outstanding shares currently the company is valued around $198 million as of this writing. they hold $18 million just in cash. the stock trades for a mere $4 under the ticker symbol otcmkts lifff. the goal is to continue to develop the yellowknife project to become one of the top deposits in not just the americas but also the world. insiders still own 50 of the stock and aren t selling. shares only went public in may 2023. lithium prices currently sit at multi year lows. as we see a supply crunch with demand skyrocketing there s no telling how long lithium prices will stay this low. this low lithium price will discourage new lithium miners to develop. meaning if competitors don t start now they won t be extracting any new lithium before 2030. that could exacerbate the supply problem even further. by then it s too late even if lithium prices rebound. an investor is better to position themselves before lithium prices go up again. . investing in li ft power at just $4 is an easy way to gain exposure to lithium but also enjoy watching the potential unfold. their next major milestone for investors is finishing their drilling in early 2024 then a feasibility study by mid 2025. consider li ft power as a potential value play in the lithium mining space as a bonus li ft power also owns four other projects in canada. cali acquired with yellowknife near the yukon border rupert located near the james bay region of quebec pontax located also near the james bay region

[TITLE_END] analysis we broke 5000 in premarket which means that we are currently trading above the call resistance. premarket trading isn t the best indicator of true price action due to the lack of volume. so when the market opens we will want to see spx consolidate above the 5000 level. it will likely retest this level so we just need to see if it holds above. we can start to see some more call interest building at 5050 and 5100 now as we approach monthly opex. we can see that here and with a different visualisation here we have shown before that the money flows into spx reached new highs. here is a different visualisation of this from nomura which shows that asset managers are basically really really long on this market. look at the skew on the mag 7. very very strong not looking like any pullback right now on the big boys. money flows in spx remain strong we are seeing some signs of possible hedging by traders in qqq. the gamma is very very high again today which tells us that again volatility should be slightly surprised although we will have the cpi revisions released which will be interesting if they show some hawkish surprises. note the last revisions data did indeed lead to dollar strengthening and yields rising. if we do get that kind of move higher we will likely see some pullback as traders hedge going into cpi print next week. see the institutional research section to read about morgan stnaley s prediction for the cpi next week. iwm lastly trading above a key gamma level skew points higher on 1 month expiration and 1 year expiration. traders expect bond yields to fall and iwm to break higher. yes market positioning does still look bullish on this market but i do want to share with you an alternative analysis from goldman sachs here. goldman note that we are now seeing extremely bullish options activity in the collective mag 6 names. this is something that we have seen 5 other times in the post covid era . we note that if you look at forward

2024-02-09,2024-02-09 14:54:40,TSLA,Tesla,trading,09 02 premarket report everything i m watching and analysing in premarket as spx breaks 5k. 09 02 premarket report everything i m watching and analysing in premarket as spx breaks 5k. [TITLE_END] analysis we broke 5000 in premarket which means that we are currently trading above the call resistance. premarket trading isn t the best indicator of true price action due to the lack of volume. so when the market opens we will want to see spx consolidate above the 5000 level. it will likely retest this level so we just need to see if it holds above. we can start to see some more call interest building at 5050 and 5100 now as we approach monthly opex. we can see that here and with a different visualisation here we have shown before that the money flows into spx reached new highs. here is a different visualisation of this from nomura which shows that asset managers are basically really really long on this market. look at the skew on the mag 7. very very strong not looking like any pullback right now on the big boys. money flows in spx remain strong we are seeing some signs of possible hedging by traders in qqq. the gamma is very very high again today which tells us that again volatility should be slightly surprised although we will have the cpi revisions released which will be interesting if they show some hawkish surprises. note the last revisions data did indeed lead to dollar strengthening and yields rising. if we do get that kind of move higher we will likely see some pullback as traders hedge going into cpi print next week. see the institutional research section to read about morgan stnaley s prediction for the cpi next week. iwm lastly trading above a key gamma level skew points higher on 1 month expiration and 1 year expiration. traders expect bond yields to fall and iwm to break higher. yes market positioning does still look bullish on this market but i do want to share with you an alternative analysis from goldman sachs here. goldman note that we are now seeing extremely bullish options activity in the collective mag 6 names. this is something that we have seen 5 other times in the post covid era . we note that if you look at forward returns after this occurrence the 2 4 week forward return is negative . we can see that in this graph below. gamma levels to watch plot these on your charting platform so you can track the price action against them. spx trading at 5013 these are the key gamma levels gamma level at 5025 my quant says max of the day expected to be 5031 5000 remains tech all resistance gamma level at 4975 below that my quant says expected min of the day if we go that low is 4965. that marks the lower bound of the expected trading range today and we can expect a bounce from here. qqq call resistance remains at 440 myq quant says upper trading bounce of today will be 436.95 gamma level at 436 too. 435 is where the 0dte call resistance is below spot key gamma level is at 430. below this my quant says min of the day expected to be 429. that d mark the bottom of the trading range if we were to fall that far. data lede us cpi revisions markets will be looking to inform their thesis for the timing of the first rate cut. this comes ahead of cpi next week. last time the 2022 revisions showed that inflation progress wasn t so great which made yields jump and the dollar jump. fed s logan speaks later though institutional research with cpi next week let s take a look at morgan stanley s cpi prediction they expect cpi decelerated to 0.26 mom in january below consensus of 0.3 said they think core services was sideways and good decelerated. energy prices will drop headline to 0.14 bank of america s put out mapper saying that stock rally close to triggering sell signal. markets spx breaks above

audience is a media industry game changer its 47 february rally supports that thesis collective audience inc. is a media industry game changer in many respects. and investors are taking notice sending caud shares higher by over 47 since the start of february. however while the run is indeed impressive it s likely the precursor to even higher gains especially as caud continues to actively stake its claim in an audience based performance advertising and ad tech sector that s expected to reach $2.9 trillion over the next seven years. the magnitude of how significant a trillion dollar market potential is can t be under appreciated particularly at a time when the once thought of as impossible mission to become a billionaire has been scored by an ever growing number of people. many professional investors thought that a company reaching the trillion dollar market cap was a far stretch of optimism. but that s been breached too with alphabet amazon and nvidia all holding valuations closer to two trillion than one. the interesting part of what s happening in the investment world is that these valuations are being scored while everyone s watching. the issue however is that many people and investors only see what they want to see and ignore not always intentionally the most monumental changes in global business and lifestyle landscapes. collective audience targets massive ad tech market a shift deserving immediate attention is how artificial intelligence including the peripheries around it is disrupting the way companies do business. that disruption is more than excellent news for clients needing best in class services it also is for investors looking to exploit opportunities exposed by innovative companies like collective audience which are capitalizing on potentially massive revenue generating opportunities by being in the right sector with the right products at the right time. for a company like caud valued at roughly $16.06 million on wednesday earning just a tiny slice of the market potential can be transformative. but know this caud wants to collect more than just market leftovers. and they intend to succeed in its mission by leveraging a products and services portfolio arsenal that can support earning an impressive share of the opportunities targeted. to ensure staying on track caud has assembled a leadership team that includes a who s who list of best in industry overachievers that can turn sales ambitions into tangible revenues. the company s recently announced addition of as ceo complements that list. wall street knows him for all the right reasons. for investors who don t and are evaluating the caud value proposition pay attention because he may help to quickly close the disconnect between his company s assets potential and share price. there s plenty to appreciate in the bio above. but the biggest reason for investors to embrace his leadership is that he has a proven track record of making small companies bigger. in most cases substantially so. and now leading caud and alongside some of the world s brightest business minds history in that respect may repeat. in fact that s likely considering caud has captured one of the digital sector goat s and by doing so has positioned themselves to become one of the most dynamic and influential companies in its target markets. an innovative products and services arsenal that presumption supports the case that even after its impressive february run considerable earned value may still be neglected in its current market cap. missing from its current valuation goes well beyond overlooking its leadership team. in may also neglect to fairly appraise the value inherent to caud assets which already position the company to target its increasing market opportunities. more value should be applied after caud and a special purpose acquisition company that previously traded on nasdaq that held an over $64 million market cap. nearly 4x higher than caud s current. however as noted the valuation gap could close quickly a likely proposition after caud debuted on the nasdaq market in november 2023. that uplist could attract significant analyst attention. a bullish view could send caud stock prices soaring considering that only about 13.73 million shares are o s with roughly 83 of those tightly held by insiders and another 5.2 owned by institutional investors. that leaves a relatively small number of shares in the public float a consideration that can help fuel and sustain a rally. the bullish speculation is more than warranted especially by factoring companies needs for an ally like caud to help them make better use of their ad budgets and publishers needing to leverage expertise to more effectively and quickly monetize their content. keep in mind that while the ad tech sector is expected to reach trillion dollar levels in less than eight years it s already substantial estimated at $748 billion in revenue generating potential just three years ago. from there and with an expected cagr of 14.7 into the next decade the case for caud bulls gets appreciably stronger supported by a combined products and services platform specifically designed to identify convert and monetize the collective audience of leading brands and publishers. right space right strategy right assets those intrinsic abilities put caud in an enviable spot to grow bigger and faster than even the staunchest caud bulls might expect. that case is not purely speculative either. it s supported by caud s abilities to target lucrative opportunities alongside some of the world s largest companies including meta and those mentioned which rely almost exclusively on ad revenues for top and bottom line growth. that s not all. while the large caps may have the means to fend off potential problems in the competitive landscape thousands of other companies especially smaller ones don t have the financial or technical resources to keep pace with changes. their challenge can be significant value drivers for caud. the better news in that respect is that caud can provide services that others can t to fill soaring demand. industry competitors like the trade desk pubmatic and magnite as good as they are in their respective target markets certainly can t handle the entirety of the market demand. even factoring in the niche focused companies like digital turbine and doubleverify while it helps still leaves considerable revenues for the taking. caud intends to earn its rightful share. that s no coincidence. as a u.s. based provider of e commerce and digital customer acquisition solutions that simplify digital advertising its proof of concept and performance attracts the right eyes by being an innovative data driven end to end provider with solutions facilitating access to data for activating campaigns across multiple channels. its digital marketing business includes a holistic self serve adtech platform a proprietary data driven and an ai powered system that enables brands and agencies to advertise across thousands of the world s leading digital media and connected tv platforms. all of that s important. remember digital marketing is widely considered the optimal solution for companies to communicate with prospective and existing customers to create business and brand awareness. moreover its value extends because digital marketing provides an easy way for companies to get creative and stand out from competitors in congested markets. that s led to significant adtech spending with many companies targeting the customers time spent on social media platforms like tiktok and instagram. of course those apps target millions of users. however as large as they are other apps retail media and gaming environments add billions of additional viewers eyes. and caud wants to connect them to the right interest through retail media connected television and e commerce channels that generate specific metrics and attribution models. a caud valuation disconnect exposed with the tools and abilities in place to bring audience objectives to life quickly efficiently and effectively caud is not a sector player to ignore. the 47 february increase indicates many investors aren t. but clients are taking notice too. and that s the real value driver behind the investment proposition since it can lead to a further steepening of caud s revenue curve. thus using virtually any valuation model especially based on a sum of its parts calculus caud presents a compelling value investment proposition. while investors are apparently taking advantage of its $1.15 share price on wednesday these levels still present what many refer to as ground floor levels. but with momentum at its back bargain prices may not last much longer a premise supported by a new era of internet and consumer landscapes that make adtech and the facilitators behind the space like collective audience an invaluable and necessary competitive tool. $caud,$caud staking s claim

named think faang or the magnificent seven the headiest gains are typically past. but riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains. to study the performance of named stock market trends my research assistants and i did a deep dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations. the final list of named trends we researched was watch for retailers walmart amazon.com target costco wholesale and home depot. fang for tech titans facebook parent meta platforms amazon netflix and google parent alphabet. faang for facebook amazon apple netflix and google. granola for big european companies gsk roche nestl l or al lvmh mo t hennessy louis vuitton novartis novo nordisk asml holding astrazeneca sap and sanofi. the magnificent seven for tech giants nvidia tesla meta apple alphabet

computing stocks notably paypal zoom video communications vimeo dropbox alphabet adobe and salesforce smaller named trends like mamaa and emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends and their inclusion wouldn t have changed results. from first mention next we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. then for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero date and 24 months after the zero date. for each named trend we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. so for instance for faang we applied a 20 weight to meta s return a 20 weight to apple s a 20 weight to amazon s 20 to netflix and 20 to alphabet. finally we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the s p 500. the first interesting finding when we look at the average of all these eight named trends we see considerable price run up before the trade being named. for the 24 months before the zero date we see the average named trend deliver 36 in excess returns. this means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened you could earn 36 percentage points above the s p 500 for the two years before it was named. worth the ride until... but even if you don t have this magical foresight it still doesn t hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. on average once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns. yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. from the 12 month mark to the 24 month mark after a trend has been named the average named trend lags behind the s p 500 by about 2 percentage points. when we look at the individual named trends it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero date to the 24 month mark in our sample were the bat and cloud trends both earning more than 60 in excess return over the two year period once they were coined by the press. on the other end the mt saas trade did the worst dropping more than 95 in excess returns over the two year period after being named. all in all this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it provided you haven t been too late to the party and ride the initial momentum if it happens. but if you get in past the 12 month mark the returns might not be so magnificent.

chip industry recovery meta microsoft wimi develop their ai technology [TITLE_END] nvidia shares continued to rise in 2024 adding about $500 billion to its market value in about six weeks. driven by ai nvidia has almost monopolized the ai chip market with an 80 market share and the h20 chip customized for china has also accepted pre orders. the rise of self generated ai has revealed the infinite possibilities of ai and it has also spawned the demand for stronger smarter and more efficient ai chips. in last year s wave of generative ai nvidia was the undisputed biggest winner. predictably ai applications are ubiquitous and have become a new battleground between chip giants. meta plans to launch a new ai chip artemisintelligence ial intelligence gold rush the chip war will burn more and more in 2024. to support the artificial intelligence business meta plans to deploy a new custom chip in its data center this year and meta plans to launch artemis of ai chips for model reasoning this year to reduce its reliance on nvidia chips. meta h as been improving its computing power to meet generative ai products in applications such as facebook instagram and whatsapp as well as hardware devices such as ray ban smart glasses. zuckerberg said last month that the company plans to have about 350 000 of nvidia s flagship h100 processors by the end of the year and with other suppliers meta will have 600 000 h100 equivalent computing power. amd microsoft makes a full preparation for ai chips in addition us chip giant amd recently raised its 2024 ai processor sales forecast by $1.5 billion to $3.5 billion. amd ceo zifeng su said on the conference call that its ai chip sales could exceed its current forecasts of $3.5 billion once more capacity starts in the second half of the year. microsoft which is betting on ai has also launched its first ai chip maia 100 to compete with nvidia s gpu and reduce its expensive reliance on nvidia. maia 100 using the 5nm process the number of transistors reaches 105 billion which can be used for large language model training and reasoning. the two chips are reportedly expected to go on sale in 2024. both custom chips power microsoft s azure data center and prepare for a future full of artificial intelligence. nadella said maia will first support microsoft s own ai applications and then to partners and customers. there is no doubt that demand for ai chips is extremely strong and most companies around the world are looking for alternatives to the nvidia h100. according to the latest forecast from market research firm gartner the ai chip market will grow 25.6 from the previous year to $67.1 billion by 2024. gartner the ai chip marketofexpected to be more than twice the size of 2023 by 2027 reaching $119.4 billion. wimi explores the value from the industrial chain definitely the outlook for ai chip demand is extremely promising. data shows as a leading ai vision enterprise wimi hologram cloud under the boom of artificial intelligence currently in semiconductor algorithm and holographic ar light field technology module and other core technology has strong strength and has developed its ai chip business to enterprise customers provide computer chip products and central processing algorithm and related services comprehensive solutions and software and semiconductor business. at present the new generation of artificial intelligence technology has given wimi a new role. wimi based on ai chip is no longer limited to command control but to carry out more image structure and big data analysis which requires cpu and other traditional chip architecture to meet the needs of ai applications. at the same time with the deepening of the industry wimiai chip technology has gradually expanded to the related scene. in terms of horizontal development ai vision is promoted to intelligent home commercial buildings intelligent security intelligent retail autonomous driving robots and other broader application scenarios. no doubt 2024 will be a year of strong chip growth and ai electrification energy transition etc. all need a large number of chip support. with its excellent technical strength and market performance wimi actively promotes the development and application of artificial intelligence technology and plays an important role in the era of artificial intelligence. with the acceleration of the global digital transformation wimi is expected to maintain its lead and drive the global semiconductor industry. to sum up in the past few years the global chip industry has been in a downturn with the entire industry oversupply and the pressure on chip inventory increasing. today the development of large models and generative artificial intelligence is significantly driving the growth of the intelligent computing power market and the various giants are driving the boom of the chip industry. however as the competition in the ai chip market intensifies it will be

the alaska energy metals ceo s comments on automotive companies. nickel prices are tanking and that s hurting companies exploration efforts according to alaska energy metals akemf ceo greg beischer . it makes it harder to raise capital because the commodity is out of favor in investors eyes beischer told benzinga. with a low stock price he added if we sell shares that s expensive capital. it dilutes our shareholders. the world s nickel mines are divided into two types of deposits sulfide and laterite. sulfide deposits offer easier extraction while laterite deposits require more energy and chemicals. because of a lack of exploration in recent years high grade sulfide deposits are becoming depleted. low grade sulfide deposits offer an alternative to the more polluting laterite deposits in indonesia. low nickel prices drive mines out of business prices for nickel a key material in stainless steel production and electric vehicle batteries are down around 30 over the past year because of oversupply from indonesian nickel mines. tempered growth forecasts for electric vehicles have also helped pressure prices. but with the tanking nickel price these low grade sulfide deposits are becoming uneconomical making it harder for developers to bring them into production beischer said. there s going to be projects like ours that are discovered and advanced that are going to have difficulty getting financed while the nickel price is low he said. at a low nickel price it starts to drive some existing mines out of business. alaska energy metals is developing its nikolai nickel sulfide project on the southern flank of the alaska range about 124 miles southeast of fairbanks. north american and european nickel users should reject nickel produced in a way that creates a net detriment to the environment even when end uses such as evs are considered in the equation he said. they can t really look themselves in the face by purchasing metals that are being produced in a manner that s anything but environmentally friendly he said. the automobile industry could play a key role in helping develop nickel deposits in north america which has strong environmental and regulatory frameworks he said. they are going to have a much stronger lobby than the mining industry could ever have he said. that will be needed to help burnish the mining industry s image as the industry is still viewed by the messes it made in the old days instead of the modern methods employed among north american miners nowadays he said. automakers such as general motors co. and tesla inc have been investing in mining companies or contracting with them to secure supplies of electric vehicle metals including nickel. ford motor co. last year said it would take a stake in a plant under construction in indonesia that will supply nickel chemicals for electric vehicle batteries. car companies and mining companies should collaborate and the government should save its money but the government should also have pro mining development policies to go with their electrification agenda beischer said. the u.s. has ceded metal supply chains to other nations but at the same time isn t particularly friendly to mining companies even though a lot of minerals will need to be produced to support the nation s electrification ambitions he said. there seems to be a disconnect he said. the permitting agencies still move very slowly. the mining industry doesn t want to see environmental regulations rolled back in the u.s. he said. rather it would like to see the timeline for

[TITLE_END] hi everyone yesterday allego nv closed at $0.85 coming from a low of $0.59 just a couple of days ago. i bought some shares yesterday because i believe it will climb above $1 in the short term and will move higher in the long term. here s why company overview allego nv provides and operates ev charging locations throughout europe. they have all kinds of chargers ranging from slow charging to ultrafast but their focus is fast charging on parking lots. they operate 34.000 charging points throughout europe. the stock is undervalued. in the us sentiment for ev related stocks is very bad. most ev stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. this resulted in a big sell off of anything related ev. but this company is not on the us market. it s a european company and the european market is totally different. in europe ev sales are still growing helped by legislation. although consumers are still reluctant to buy one big organisations are all switching to evs. most big companies or government organisations have strict co2 reduction goals and switching to evs is a quick win. these organisations have to install chargers on their parking lots and allego has been providing these since 2013. these big organisations will negotiate pricing agreements on the energy prices so the margins will be thin. but the big advantage is the charging needs on these parking lots are predictable and continuous. this was their main focus during the starting years of the company and a smart strategy they were able to build revenue and gain expertise with predictable income in a time when private ev ownership was still low. in short allego has a baseline steady stream of predictable revenue from partnerships with big organisations by providing charging solutions for their own fleet of cars. their focus in the last 3 years has been to partner with big companies to build charging stations on their parking lots to offer charging solutions to the public. they landed some big contracts burger kings europe . they are slowly shifting their strategy to offering public charging stations which make sense in 2024 when ev ownership is getting higher and still increasing in europe. on these public charging stations the charging hours and predictability will be lower but margins will be higher. in short allego has shifted very successfully to offering public charging locations on parking lots of businesses such as supermarkets restaurants and hotels. the company started in the netherlands which has been one of the front runners in ev adoption. bigger countries such as france and germany were slower to adopt evs but are catching up rapidly . in these countries there s a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time so allego is very quickly winning contracts all over europe. their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed allego to grow fast at the moment. there s not a lot of competition in europe some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand alone locations next to the major roads . in short allego is extremely well positioned to deploy new charging locations throughout europe at a rapid pace since there is hardly any real competitor in europe that does what they do. financially allego is in a reasonabe position. their 2023 revenue is up 28 from 2022 and is expected to grow another 30 in 2024. they are about to publish their full year results but i expect the total revenue to be around 185m in 2023 . their gross margins are pretty good and their operational ebitda will be around 35m . their total debt is 320m which is obviously quite high and their interest payments are too high compared to their revenue. but in 2023 they made several big investments and they landed some big contracts in exchange for equity. also their cash flow is improving so i expect them to continue into 2024 without increasing their debt. this will be a crucial turning point in their way towards profitability. in short allego has strong revenues and margins with good growth numbers. their debt is high and they should be careful not to increase it but they already made big investments in 2023 that should pay off in 2024. all in all allego is in pole position to becoming the biggest ev charging provider in europe. they have a smart strategy in place and lack competition. they are on their way to stopping the cash burn in 2024 and turning profitable in 2025. some macro economic developments are helping them grow such as strict european legislation. other macro economic developments may be unpredictable such as energy prices or energy net congestion. the stock price has fallen because of negative sentiment surrounding electric vehicles and this provides an excellent buying opportunity get yourself some of these shares in the $0.80 $0.85 price range on their 2023 full year results i think they will climb to $1 . let me know

updates on tuesday may 7 2024. on that day nikola s management will hold a conference call and webcast at 10 30 a.m. et to review and discuss the company s business and outlook. today nikola stock jumped by as much as nearly 16 on news that it produced 43 of the class 8 fcevs and sold 40 of them to wholesalers destined for end customers in the first quarter. those deliveries were on top of the 35 trucks shipped in the fourth quarter of 2023 in its first quarterly production period. nikola surpassed estimates for deliveries of its hydrogen big rigs in the first quarter a sign it was making progress in its pivot to the technology from battery electric trucks after some missteps that battered its share price. nikola in february set a target to deliver as many as 350 hydrogen powered fuel cell electric trucks in 2024 and said it had delivered 35 units in the fourth quarter. we are on track for a successful 2024 by continuing the momentum set in 2023 said nikola ceo steve girsky. it s about more than just setting goals. it s about following through on our commitments. this includes not only the production and sale of our hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks but also the start of returns for our battery electric trucks to customers. forbes article while its current sales volume is modest delivering just 154 hydrogen and battery trucks since last year nikola appears to be far outselling tesla in the electric truck market.elon musk said in late 2022 when the tesla semi presumably went into production that deliveries would ramp up throughout 2023 with a target of delivering 50 000 this year. however the company hasn t shared any delivery figures for it since then. the truck wasn t referenced in first quarter delivery figures released this week and tesla also didn t include semi figures in its quarterly financial filings last year. the model was listed as still being in pilot production in tesla s annual report filed early this year with no details.notably the tesla semi also isn t registered among the trucks qualifying for california s clean truck rebates the nation s most generous suggesting it s not being sold in the market where demand for electric commercial vehicles is highest. so far the only known users of the tesla semi are frito lay and pepsi which have about 100 trucks hauling chips and soda in california.tesla didn t respond to a request for details on how many semis it s shipped so far and when it would register the truck for california incentives. my other favorite is allego european ev postponed ec due to a filing but they just got

charging hubs. we are upgrading our retail network with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers in response to changing customer needs read the company s 2024 energy transition strategy. this news tells us what shell are thinking and of course that demand globally will be rising. company overview allego nv provides and operates ev charging locations throughout europe. they have all kinds of chargers ranging from slow charging to ultrafast but their focus is fast charging on parking lots. they operate 34.000 charging points throughout europe. the stock is undervalued. in the us sentiment for ev related stocks is very bad. most ev stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. this resulted in a big sell off of anything related ev. but this company is not on the us market. it s a european company and the european market is totally different. sales in europe ev sales are still growing helped by legislation. although consumers are still reluctant to buy one big organisations are all switching to evs. most big companies or government organisations have strict co2 reduction goals and switching to evs is a quick win. the company started in the netherlands which has been one of the front runners in ev adoption. bigger countries such as france and germany were slower to adopt evs but are catching up rapidly . in these countries there s a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time so allego is very quickly winning contracts all over europe. their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed allego to grow fast at the moment. there s not a lot of competition in europe some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand alone locations next to the major roads . financially third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2 to 28.6 million compared to 22.3 million in the prior year period. third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0 to 22.0 million compared to 14.4 million for the three months ended september 30 2022. gross profit increased to 5.4 million compared to million in the prior year period gross margin during the quarter was 18.9 . third quarter 2023 net loss was million compared to million in the prior year period operational ebitda was 2.6 million reflecting higher charging revenue and improved charging gross margin compared to the prior year period loss of million. allego recently signed two power purchase agreements totaling 100 gigawatt hours of energy per year with energy solutions group the largest independent green energy producer in the benelux region with renewable energy sourced from a solar park that is expected to be operational in january 2024 and a wind farm that is expected to be completed in january 2025. in october allego recorded over 1 million sessions per month across its network. all in all allego is in pole position to becoming the biggest ev charging provider in europe. they have a smart strategy in place and lack competition. they are on their way to stopping the cash burn in 2024 and turning profitable in 2025. some macro economic developments are helping

ford deal likely to enhance 2024 guidance $allg [TITLE_END] previous post i made a wee mistake confusing volvo and ford. my bad recent price action has been slowly dropping on low volume has been running into perceived earning calls but got delayed due to a form lacking. i expect this to run again my target 2$ 3$ especially with volvo as a partner and the many partners to come in the near term. the market shell an energy force to be reckoned with in the united states has one of the largest station footprints in the nation.to meet the growing need for public ev charging stations however yahoo finance reported the company s announcement to shut down 1 000 gas pumps and replace them with public ev charging hubs. we are upgrading our retail network with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers in response to changing customer needs read the company s 2024 energy transition strategy. this news tells us what shell are thinking and of course that demand globally will be rising. company overview allego nv provides and operates ev charging locations throughout europe. they have all kinds of chargers ranging from slow charging to ultrafast but their focus is fast charging on parking lots. they operate 34.000 charging points throughout europe. the stock is undervalued. in the us sentiment for ev related stocks is very bad. most ev stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. this resulted in a big sell off of anything related ev. but this company is not on the us market. it s a european company and the european market is totally different. sales in europe ev sales are still growing helped by legislation. although consumers are still reluctant to buy one big organisations are all switching to evs. most big companies or government organisations have strict co2 reduction goals and switching to evs is a quick win. the company started in the netherlands which has been one of the front runners in ev adoption. bigger countries such as france and germany were slower to adopt evs but are catching up rapidly . in these countries there s a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time so allego is very quickly winning contracts all over europe. their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed allego to grow fast at the moment. there s not a lot of competition in europe some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand alone locations next to the major roads . financially third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2 to 28.6 million compared to 22.3 million in the prior year period. third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0 to 22.0 million compared to 14.4 million for the three months ended september 30 2022. gross profit increased to 5.4 million compared to million in the prior year period gross margin during the quarter was 18.9 . third quarter 2023 net loss was million compared to million in the prior year period operational ebitda was 2.6 million reflecting higher charging revenue and improved charging gross margin compared to the prior year period loss of million. allego recently signed two power purchase agreements totaling 100 gigawatt hours of energy per year with energy solutions group the largest independent green energy producer in the benelux region with renewable energy sourced from a solar park that is expected to be operational in january 2024 and a wind farm that is expected to be completed in january 2025. in october allego recorded over 1 million sessions per month across its network. all in all allego is in pole position to becoming the biggest ev charging provider in europe. they have a smart strategy in place and lack competition. they are on their way to stopping the cash burn in 2024 and turning profitable in 2025. some macro economic developments are helping them grow such as strict european legislation.,$allg allego hoovering 1$ waiting ec ford deal likely

[TITLE_END] hi r investing roughly 10 years ago there was a great discussion about i discussed my method trending value and that led to me sharing my results with many of you via a program i had written. well that program broke and remained dormant for years... until now. so what is trending value it s a method published by james o shaughnessey in his what works on wall street book. during decades of backtesting it generated over 21 annual returns with equal standard deviation to the total market. it generated a lot of discussion and lead to in my mind this method resonates the truest... far truer than those who advocate watching the check out lines at your grocery store to see which products are being purchased. the method summarizing is the following when you run a screen for stocks with good p e or p b what do you look for you find a stock with a p e multiple of 12. is this good is this bad neither and both without a frame of reference. o shaughnessey s method rates 6 key financial metrics for every stock against the whole market to come up with a cumulative value based score. those metrics are p e p b p fcf p s ev ebitda and shareholder yield which is dividend yield stock buyback yield . all 6 metrics are ranked 0 100 where 100 is the best ratio in the stock universe and 0 is the worst. the top 10 of stocks will typically have scores in the 420 range. they are undervalued relative to the rest of the market. however just because a stock is undervalued does not mean that it s a good buy. it could be facing legal action failing drug trials having a ceo that just went to jail or other event that can t be reflected in these numbers. that s where momentum comes into play. we take the top decile of stocks and reorder them by 6 month price momentum. invest equally in the top 25 hold for a year liquidate repeat. the companies you buy are undervalued and the market is rallying behind them. back testing while not a prediction of future results yielded a 21.2 average roi with this method. of course there s no screener that does this nor is there a way to even view shareholder yield in one location. when i started this 10 years back yes matlab. wrong tool for the job. thankfully chatgpt has turned even amateur hobbyist coders into useful contributors and a python version has been born. i ll post the results of today s run below. feel free to ask for a specific stock and i ll post the results of that ticker. keep in mind it is filtered to market cap $200m and the name of the method is trending value your growth stocks are going to be viewed very poorly. edit you ll occasionally see a value like 10000 for p e or another field. that means the value was either missing or negative. this is to artificially just kill that field for that ticker.,10 years ago discussed select stocks. s 2024 version. 10 years ago discussed select stocks. s 2024 version.

[TITLE_END] i m really impressed with meta s smart moves in virtual reality and their big picture thinking for the next decade. however their decision to add large language models to apps like instagram threads facebook and whatsapp has me scratching my head a bit. generally people hop onto these platforms to chat and get entertained not for heavy duty tasks like studying or research which are typical uses for llms. trying to do homework or deep dives into topics on a buzzing social media site that sounds pretty distracting. i think meta could really hit it out of the park if they used llms to boost their advertising game instead. imagine an llm that helps advertisers craft killer campaigns or dig deeper into understanding their audiences. sort of like palantir s software of gathering data and using an llm to sort it and understand it better but with consumers and their buying habits. that could really amp up what meta offers to businesses and drive their growth much more effectively. i still think meta is a big buy since their forward pe is in the 20 s and mark zuckerberg has a great vision for the company besides this move solid buy. if anyone disagrees with me please let me know,meta s new ai feature looks kind useless. meta s new ai feature looks kind useless.

missing paperwork. when this happened volume dropped. allego has be hovering above 1$ comfortably for weeks. allego just closed a big deal with ford and is expanding rapidly very volatile stock due to high institutional ownership. low volume daily. apollo group backed expecting some news good growth and solid financial improvement. prior to the delay volume was crazy and it looked like it was going to exceed 2$ easy. x200b company overview allego nv provides and operates ev charging locations throughout europe. they have all kinds of chargers ranging from slow charging to ultrafast but their focus is fast charging on parking lots. they operate 34.000 charging points throughout europe. the stock is undervalued. in the us sentiment for ev related stocks is very bad. most ev stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. this resulted in a big sell off of anything related ev. but this company is not on the us market. it s a european company and the european market is totally different. sales in europe ev sales are still growing helped by legislation. although consumers are still reluctant to buy one big organisations are all switching to evs. most big companies or government organisations have strict co2 reduction goals and switching to evs is a quick win. the company started in the netherlands which has been one of the front runners in ev adoption. bigger countries such as france and germany were slower to adopt evs but are catching up rapidly . in these countries there s a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time so allego is very quickly winning contracts all over europe. their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed allego to grow fast at the moment. there s not a lot of competition in europe some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand alone locations next to the major roads . financially third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2 to 28.6 million compared to 22.3 million in the prior year period. third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0 to 22.0 million compared to 14.4 million for the three months ended september 30 2022. gross profit increased to 5.4 million compared to million in the prior year period gross margin during the quarter was 18.9 . third quarter 2023 net loss was million compared to million in the prior year period operational ebitda was 2.6 million reflecting higher charging revenue and improved charging gross margin compared to the prior year period loss of million. allego recently signed two power purchase agreements totaling 100 gigawatt hours of energy per year with energy solutions group the largest independent green energy producer in the benelux region with renewable energy sourced from a solar park that is expected to be operational in january 2024 and a wind farm that is expected to be completed in january 2025. in october allego recorded over 1 million sessions per

delayed twice. very very annoying and unprofessional. hopefully they will drop earnings next week. but there is a nugget in the sec filings. net loss from 305 million to 98 million. call me crazy but allego is running toward profit in a matter of months for the year ended december 31 2023 the registrant expects subject to potential adjustments as a result of the completion of the annual audit to report a net loss of approximately 98.2 million compared to a net loss of approximately 305.3 million for the year ended december 31 2022. the decrease in net loss was primarily due to improved operational performance and a substantial decrease of share based payment expenses following the listing in 2022. ford allego team up for fast ev charging at dealers across europe allego enters into partnership with burger king france to enable its restaurants to provide ultra fast charging reinforcing allego s leading position in france company overview allego nv provides and operates ev charging locations throughout europe. they have all kinds of chargers ranging from slow charging to ultrafast but their focus is fast charging on parking lots. they operate 34.000 charging points throughout europe. the stock is undervalued. in the us sentiment for ev related stocks is very bad. most ev stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. this resulted in a big sell off of anything related ev. but this company is not on the us market. it s a european company and the european market is totally different. sales in europe ev sales are still growing helped by legislation. although consumers are still reluctant to buy one big organisations are all switching to evs. most big companies or government organisations have strict co2 reduction goals and switching to evs is a quick win. the company started in the netherlands which has been one of the front runners in ev adoption. bigger countries such as france and germany were slower to adopt evs but are catching up rapidly . in these countries there s a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time so allego is very quickly winning contracts all over europe. their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed allego to grow fast at the moment. there s not a lot of competition in europe some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand alone locations next to the major roads . financially third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2 to 28.6 million compared to 22.3 million in the prior year period. third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0 to 22.0 million compared to 14.4 million for the three months ended september 30 2022. gross profit increased to 5.4 million compared to million in the prior year

operational losses and significant debt levels can be considered a forward looking strategy particularly for those who are bullish on the future of electric vehicles and renewable technologies. nio s debt is largely a reflection of its aggressive investment in research and development infrastructure and expanding production capabilities. these investments are critical for gaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving ev market. by financing growth and innovation nio is positioning itself to capture a significant share of the global ev market which is expected to grow substantially. nio is not just focusing on the chinese market but is also eyeing expansion into europe and potentially other international markets giving it more growth opportunities. the automotive industry is undergoing a significant transformation moving away from fossil fuels to electric and hybrid vehicles. this shift is expected to continue due to the decreasing cost of batteries improved ev infrastructure and increasing societal awareness about climate change. however the journey to other countries such as america does not come without challenges especially with the giant ev manufacturer tesla running the show. tesla has a strong brand presence in the u.s. recognized for pioneering the electric car industry and backed by high profile ceo elon musk. tesla s brand is associated with innovation quality and sustainability aspects that resonate well with american consumers. nio while a recognized brand in china and some parts of europe would need marketing efforts to establish similar recognition in the u.s. for nio to compete effectively it will need to differentiate its vehicles through unique features possibly focusing on its innovative battery as a service model advanced autonomous driving capabilities and superior interior luxury which are some of nio s strong suits. tesla s extensive supercharger network provides a significant competitive edge in the u.s. where infrastructure is a critical factor for ev adoption. nio would need to either build its own charging infrastructure form alliances with existing networks or innovate around this challenge perhaps by emphasizing its battery swap technology which provides a full battery charge in a matter of minutes as opposed to longer charging times at a typical ev station. navigating the u.s. regulatory environment can be challenging particularly for a foreign company amid heightened tensions between the u.s. and china over trade and technology transfer. nio will need to manage these aspects carefully ensuring compliance with u.s. regulations and possibly facing higher tariffs or trade barriers that could affect pricing and competitiveness. for a more numbers driven analysis you

rewarding whether it has helped or not. conviction a big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor i am. i invest in what i believe in long term. however someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. you must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths. conviction investing works for me because even when building products i ve always been strong with product vision strategy and always building for the future so it makes sense that i invest the same way. i m not sure why

2024-06-11,2024-06-11 01:47:25,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",investing,fiverr an unfairly beaten down pandemic stock an investment thesis for what currently looks like a contrarian bet. fiverr an unfairly beaten down pandemic stock an investment thesis for what currently looks like a contrarian bet. [TITLE_END] context a lot of pandemic era stocks lacked basic unit economics and were found out when the funding stopped and subsequently collapsed. some had network effects unit economics but needed to get fit some have righted their mid pandemic wrongs with clear turnaround value creation plans and been rewarded and some have righted the wrongs but not yet been rewarded. i think fiverr sits in this latter category. fiverr is a leading freelance marketplace which connects businesses with freelancers offering a wide range of services. about the company founded in 2010 by micha kaufman and shai winiger in tel aviv fiverr operates a two sided marketplace matching small businesses with freelancers. with approximately 700 employees fiverr is listed on the new york stock exchange and had a market cap of just under $1 billion in june 2024 down from about $11 billion during the covid 19 pandemic. problem statement fiverr solves fiverr transforms the opaque and inefficient process of hiring freelancers into a modern user friendly e commerce experience. unique selling proposition fiverr offers an easy to use platform where people can buy and sell small services for a flat starting fee. the platform boasts a comprehensive catalogue of services and well vetted freelancers. potential sources of network effects buyers around 4 million buyers with approximately 65 of core marketplace revenue from repeat buyers indicating sustained user engagement. service categories over 700 freelance service categories including recent additions like ai content and development. gigs range from $5 to $50 000. freelancers approximately 400 000 active freelance sellers. investment thesis star company fiverr operates in a profitable and growing market niche with growth exceeding 10 per year. it is a leader in its niche matching freelancers to smaller smes effectively. this makes it a star company . reasons why i think the stock will rise 1. overly beaten down tech stock fiverr has seen its share price decline by over 90 from its february 2021 peak. this significant drop which has also recently been exacerbated by the geopolitical concerns in israel and palestine and the disruptive impact of ai on its business is a common trend among tech stocks that were covid 19 beneficiaries. what seems to have been overlooked is fiverr retains a very viable and growing business post pandemic. 2. shift to profitability and cash generation fiverr s growth has slowed to approximately 10 year over year as it has pivoted its focus towards profitability and cash generation addressing investor demand for a focus on fundamentals. this strategic shift is reflected in improved bottom line results including free cash flow and earnings per share underpinned by key performance indicators like higher average ticket sizes and growing gross margins. 3. attractive valuation metrics following recent share price pressures fiverr currently trades at a 2024 forecast earnings enterprise value multiple that is attractive given its 10 growth rate and acceleration in key value creation metrics including eps fcf per share and return on invested capital . 4. ai concerns appear overblown investors are concerned ai will disrupt the services provided by freelancers on fiverr s platform but fiverr s q1 2024 results exceeded expectations leading to raised guidance for the full year. management has highlighted the net positive impact of ai on the business. 5. stable take rate and financial resilience fiverr s take rate remains stable at 30 it has a $304m net cash position and the company is free cash flow positive providing significant financial resilience. i.e. it has gotten beyond default alive . 6. dynamic macro environment while the macroeconomic environment remains challenging with constrained budgets in large enterprises and financial pressures on small businesses fiverr s high exposure to smaller businesses positions revenues to rebound quickly as conditions improve. 7. share buyback program in may 2024 fiverr initiated a $100 million share buyback program reflecting management s belief that the stock is undervalued. they are confident in their cash position and free cash flow generation to support this initiative. 8. large short float the short float was around 10 as of june 2024 indicating the possibility of large upwards price moves if sentiment on the stock changes as i think it should. overall fiverr s strategic focus on profitability robust financial health and proactive management of market challenges make it a compelling investment opportunity. things i don t like about the stock 1. share based compensation the level of share based compensation appears excessive and results in significant dilution. deducting sbc from free cash flow results in a near zero number meaning free cash flow per share is not trending up as quickly as desired. 2. ai cannibalization threat ai has the potential to cannibalize certain services offered on fiverr such as logo design and article writing which could impact revenue. 3. buyer trends while the number of buyers has been declining this has been offset by an increase in the average purchase price. this trend is concerning and needs to be monitored. overall looks like a decent buy at current prices. it currently trades at $24.5. analyst expectations are $26 on the low end and $45 at the high. my target is late $30s i placed a limit buy order at $24.5 which filled last night. at the same time i also took a position in upwork which has the same business model but is focussed on larger customers and is perhaps better equipped for ai implementation type services. $fvrr $fvrr,fiverr unfairly beaten pandemic stock investment thesis currently looks like contrarian

weekly dd [TITLE_END] hey guys. i appreciate all the comments on the previous posts some of the tickers suggested were actually pretty solid. kulr has been the most suggested ticker for me to check out for awhile and here it is. as always please feel free to suggest any companies you want me to check out kulr technology group inc. $kulr market cap 66m company overview kulr technology group develops and commercializes thermal management technologies for electronics batteries and other components. their products serve markets such as electric vehicles energy storage battery recycling transportation cloud computing and 5g communication devices. company highlights kulr had a solid 2023 with a 146 revenue increase to $9.8 million and a customer base that grew from 36 to 53. this growth shows rising demand for their tech. looking at q1 2024 revenue was steady at $1.75 million. what stands out though is the 769 jump in contract services revenue to $1.13 million indicating a strong demand for their specialized services. they more than doubled their revenue generating customers which is a promising sign. they did see gross margins drop to 29 but they managed to cut sg a expenses significantly and almost halved their r d expenses. one of the most compelling aspects of kulr is their partnerships. they secured a $1 million order from h55 for electric aviation applications and are working with nanoracks for space applications. kulr is also developing next gen battery solutions for the u.s. army. management often mentions that they have significant partnerships with large companies although many are under ndas. for example they hinted at the potential use of their safecase in apple stores and amazon prime shipments showing their broad market reach. kulr has also launched an online marketplace for their safecase and safesleeve products approved by the u.s. department of transportation and accepted by ups for battery transport. they ve delivered power cell batteries for ai enabled drone missions in ukraine and customized battery solutions for the u.s. army to enhance tactical operations. cematrix corporation $ctxxf $cvx.v market cap 63m company overview cematrix corporation based in calgary canada produces advanced cellular concrete products for infrastructure industrial energy and commercial markets across north america. their solutions are used for lightweight fill insulation and grouting applications. company highlights 2023 was a big year for cematrix as it was their first year of profitability. revenue jumped to $53.3 million from $29 million in 2022 a clear indicator that demand for their products is on the rise. gross profit also saw a solid increase to $11.9 million up from $2.5 million the previous year showing their effective cost management. in q1 2024 the company continued to perform well. they reported $8.4 million in revenue an improvement from $7.2 million in q1 2023. what is important though is that their gross margin saw a juicy increase reaching $2.6 million compared to just $746 000 in the same quarter last year. this shows they are scaling operations efficiently while managing costs. their cellular concrete products are particularly impressive for their high strength to weight ratio resistance to hydrocarbons and durability against freeze thaw cycles. these features make them ideal for applications like road construction and utility insulation. for example the resistance to hydrocarbons ensures stability even when exposed to oil or gas spills which is crucial for long term infrastructure projects. the company operates through three subsidiaries cematrix inc mixonsite usa inc and pacific international grout company. this structure allows them to manage and scale operations efficiently across north america. additionally they have received approvals from multiple transportation authorities which shows their credibility. some positive client testimonials display their effectiveness in reducing project costs and timelines. for example one client reported saving over 5 000 man hours and accelerating their schedule by seven weeks due to cematrix s efficient product application. american salars lithium inc. $asalf $usli.cn market cap 7m company overview american salars lithium inc. focuses on exploring and developing high value battery metals projects catering to the growing electric vehicle market. company highlights american salars stood out to me due to its resource rich projects and strategic acquisitions. their candela ii lithium brine project in argentina holds an inferred resource of 457 000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent positioning them well to meet the rising lithium demand from the ev sector over the next few years. the recent acquisition of the pocitos 1 lithium salar project along with pocitos 2 adds an inferred resource of 760 000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent. the proximity to essential infrastructure enhances the project s value. moreover completing the environmental and social baseline report for pocitos 1 and 2 is a significant step towards securing production permits adding credibility to the project. their blackrock south lithium brine project in nevada is another asset worth noting. its location near the tesla gigafactory could open doors for future partnerships and logistical advantages. financially the company raised $844 999 in april 2024 and $580 000 in may 2024 through private placements. these funds are allocated for advancing exploration at candela ii demonstrating their commitment to developing this project. new leadership has brought in experienced professionals. ceo robert nick horsley with over 19 years in finance and m a and cfo daryn gordon a mining sector expert bring valuable expertise to the company. a nice bonus is that the company maintains a lean capital structure with just 23 million shares outstanding suggesting potential for significant upside. in terms of technology their work at the university of melbourne using ekosolve dle technology is impressive. they managed a 94.9 extraction efficiency and produced lithium carbonate with 99.8 purity. this breakthrough could really boost their production capabilities and set them apart. if you are reading this your a real one so suggest a ticker and if it is actually good i will post my thoughts on it in a future post. ty $kulr $ctxxf $cvx $asalf $usli,3 penny stocks going dollar soon $ stocksy s weekly dd 3 penny stocks going dollar soon $ stocksy s weekly dd [TITLE_END] hey guys. appreciate

and energy storage powers the ai era [TITLE_END] whenever investors are disappointed with tesla elon musk surprises short sellers with a big move. on tuesday tesla posted stronger than expected q2 deliveries hinting at a turning point for weak demand with an upside in q3 deliveries. additionally energy storage deployments doubled quarter over quarter potentially helping to meet the vast electricity demand that comes with ai. these factors are enough to bring in a substantial influx of tesla bulls. thanks to these developments tesla surged over 10 on tuesday with its market value reaching $737.5 billion maintaining a six day rally and breaking another resistance level which is always a bullish sign. from april s low tesla shares are now up 67 . q2 deliveries slightly exceed expectations amid record june deliveries from chinese ev makers zero interest car purchases expected to drive crazy q3 demand according to tesla s delivery data released on tuesday the company delivered 440 000 new vehicles in q2 down 4.8 year over year but up 15 quarter over quarter and better than the market s expectation of 439 300 vehicles. the total production in q2 was about 411 000 cars resulting in a delivery production gap of 33 000 cars compared to 46 000 cars in the previous quarter . tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of german factories and the red sea conflict which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short term supply struggles to meet demand which is obviously more exciting than excess supply. considering that chinese ev makers such as nio zeekr and leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in june this implies a significant recovery in demand for tesla. the company also launched a major campaign on monday introducing five year zero interest financing for model 3 y and other preferential policies. specifically users who place an order before and including july 31 can avail themselves of a no down payment deal with an initial down payment of 79 900 yuan the daily installment for the model 3 rwd and long range awd will be as low as 85 yuan and 107 yuan respectively while the model y rwd and long range will be as low as 95 yuan and 118 yuan per day. users who make a down payment of 45 900 yuan can opt for a five year low interest plan . the chinese market accounts for about 22.5 of tesla s revenue and if this measure is implemented in other countries in the future it would indeed be a massive move. this also adds a new narrative for tesla s q3 growth. energy storage deployment doubles benefitting from ai era both nvidia ceo jensen huang and openai ceo sam altman have pointed out that the future development of artificial intelligence is closely related to energy and storage. while tesla s ai business has yet to show tangible benefits its energy storage business is poised to become a pillar of ai in the future. tesla reported that it deployed 9.4 gwh of energy storage products in q2 setting a new record for quarterly deployment more than double the 4 gwh in q1 and the company s energy storage deployments in the first half of the year almost matched the total for last year. morgan stanley analyst adam jonas praised as gen ai acceleration spurs a multigenerational increase in energy demand electricity generation and data center

2024-07-11,2024-07-11 03:31:49,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,nike is a bargain right now nike is a bargain right now [TITLE_END] right now these prices are an absolute fire sale. maybe i missed the part where people are going to stop buying nike worldwide. apparely nike has less going for it than it did in 2018 i mean just look at this chart below that covers 10 years you have a volume read of 129 996 982 on june 28th. right now the markets are highly infactuated with tech stocks and things like tsla or pltr. something boring like nike is far from the excitement anyone is looking for as new ath s are being made every day on qqq or spy. theres nothing sexy about it at all. this is where the best prices can be obtained. no one wants the stock. so few people want the stock that they are willing to actually sell it at prices first seen may 25th 2018. even in 2020 with a full blown pandemic breaking out with unknown consequences only saw nike hang out below this price for a whopping 7 trading days. lil trip down and v shape recovery. even from a pure volume only perspective the following shows some interesting things the lowest volume day is about 15.95m for any day since the big drop. the volume on the day of the big drop is unprecedented. the 2nd highest volume day in the last decade was 12 23 2015. hilariously almost around the same price the high of that day back then was 68.20 and was a new all time high. the difference with large volume down here is its the opposite. large amounts of demand are showing up down here. in the past the big volume was correlated with being near big highs. but nike wasnt even near its high right before it dropped either. so what i would say is that finding a bottom is a matter of flushing people out. you gotta get to that point where even the most committed person who would have a 1 chance of selling pre earnings is now ready to and currently selling. thats probably going on and we couldn t sport such volume down here if there wasn t some equal demand. the price has not moved much. you have a high there of 79.05 and we are down to about 72 now. lets just look at the actual income here over the last 10 years the revenue is only going up. even if the company is faltering so to speak these prices are far from connected to the reality of actual income. check out the p e below even right here you can see that right now nike is sporting a p e that looks to be just over 20. but its actually even lower and this chart is delayed the last time the p e was under 18.30 was nov of 2011... now heres what i do know. alot of fund managers are going to be looking at these beautiful pictures over the coming weeks months they are going to potentially sell some of those wildly running high stocks. then they will be sitting on some cash they need to find another play for. all of a sudden seemingly out of nowhere on your favorite stock channel all the analysts will be upgrading nike. show hosts and guests will be talking about how the stock is too cheap and all that fun fancy stuff they do after they bought the ol dippity skippity. they are going to have to do something with the money. they will see nike. i doubt they will just pass it up. since the fed hasnt cut rates yet theres nothing to really worry about. even when that happens markets should run a good 3 5 further before they tap out from whatever caused the fed to cut in the first place. now lastly what brought me to this trade idea at all adobe. how did adobe lead you to see something in nike i remember 2022. in 2022 there was a big gap down and this brought adobe to prices not 1st achieved since sept of 2018. i passed this one up. i let the fear keep me out of the trade. surely everyone who was selling was correct. obviously thats the crowd that always wins. since we are dealing with panic lets get up close and examine how the panic works the day of panic was mid sept and a bottom was put in over the next two weeks. it did however fight against going higher. you can see that in those micro higher lows leading into mid nov where it said goodbye to those lows permenantly. so quite clearly any attempts to make the stock run in the near term should be expected to be stamped out. espeically if we see a run back up to 78. it will probably have to retest its low whatever it is a couple of times over the coming months. quite clearly those retests whenever they happen should end higher on that day as they did with adobe there. that would be a sign of people buying the dip 10 10. it won t happen overnight but i do think the stock could fill its gap within the next 3 4 months. even if things get bad around the election period nike already got the business. tldr everyone hates nike so you should love it long time. thats all you really need to know.,nike bargain right nike bargain right [TITLE_END] right prices absolute sale. maybe missed people going stop buying nike worldwide. apparely nike going did 2018 mean just look

2024-07-12,2024-07-12 16:42:07,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,how this door handle cost tesla half of my investment how this door handle cost tesla half of my investment [TITLE_END] today i arrived in bangkok with my girlfriend and ordered us to grab to get us to the hotel. i ve heard about byd before and that it s the chinese tesla but i d never expected to be driven in one of those cars for $2.63 through the midst of bangkok traffic for over 30 minutes. if you take a look at the design features and changes tesla s made over the last couple of years the companies beginning and elon musk of course it s obvious that they re trying to revolutionize the electric vehicle market with features like the yoke steering wheel the outer door handles and much much more. however if you look at the company byd how cheap they are producing their vehicles how amazing the design and the quality is in general you won t be able not to be amazed what china s done in that regard as well. one thing that struck me the most is the inner door handle... sounds weird but think about it how either unnatural or unnecessarily cumbersome are the inner handles of car doors either you have to pull the handle with one arm and push the door with the other handle or you bend your fingers in an unnatural angle to the side pulling in a curve to push the door open with your elbow. this might not be one of the most important topics when talking about a car and most people probably never thought of this as a problem or inconvenient but if you ve read the book atomic habits you might know where i m going with this. james clear at one point goes into detail about a racing bike team that improved every single little detail in their lifes to get every little advantage over the competition they could get. needless to say that after dozens of little improvements they became impressively successful making history for their country in this sport. i believe the same to be true for companies their culture their product and their team. and in the case of byd it definitely applies in a bunch of cases just like it did with tesla a couple of years ago . i ve been an investor in tesla since 2016 because i believed in the product and elon musk and made good money owning the stock however with tesla becoming being a blue chip stock not a growth stock anymore the percentage gain is going to be limited compared to byd which is until now rarely represented in the western world compared to tesla. tesla s got a market cap of 839.59 billion vs byd being at 96.16 billion which would mean byd has about an 8x to go until it catches up with tesla. and i m expecting higher prices on tesla too... when i talked to a friend at mercedes a couple of days ago he told me that china s investing so much money into the research of electric vehicles and the development of batteries that many european projects and car companies already gave up as they don t have the funding and resources provided by the chinese government. seeing how china s developed over the last 10 20 years and investments into modern technology they ve already passed by most western countries if they keep that trajectory going they ll be miles ahead 10 years from now. what do you think,door handle cost tesla half investment door handle cost tesla half investment [TITLE_END] today arrived bangkok girlfriend ordered grab hotel. ve heard byd s

2024-07-23,2024-07-23 21:30:29,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,deep dive into match group $mtch deep dive into match group $mtch [TITLE_END] 1.0 introduction match group is a company that continues to benefit from the society in which we live. the best way to introduce it is by sharing the apps brands it owns tinder hinge match meetic plenty of fish pairs azar hakuna and many more. the estimate is it has 50 market share in the u.s. and impressive profitability. here s its revenue and operating margin over time 2019 $2.1b 2020 $2.4b 2021 $3.0b 2022 $3.2b 2023 $3.4b there are two key points 1. this is a resilient business regardless if there s a pandemic or inflation there is always demand for connecting with another human being. 2. the operating margin has decreased at first glance this might seem concerning and you might wonder is this a trend the lower margin is caused by the management s decision to increase the r d expense significantly . this is expected to generate value in the future by introducing new products or new features as part of the existing products. however it is clear that the the current margin decrease is the outcome of a conscious management decision and is not caused by outside pressure. if the additional r d expense isn t adding value the management will reverse it which will bring its old profitability back. with this in mind i don t see any reason why the operating profitability would further decrease. 2.0 the worrisome society 2.1 the world is changing and the internet has a significant impact on how couples meet. based on a survey more than 50 of the couples have met online. this number has doubled over the last decade meaning the number of dating app users has increased . this doesn t come as a surprise but given that the younger generations are tech savvy i don t think we ve reached the peak . 2.2 not only that but the new generations are using more apps . based on match group s investor presentation back in january 2023 the average number of apps used by individuals under 35 was 4.3 . i would not be surprised if this widens further. 2.3 lastly there are fewer marriages meaning the apps are being used for a longer period of time . to summarize we have more users using more dating apps and for much longer . 3.0 the biggest concern competition of course every company has competition. given the market share it seems as if match group is winning this battle by a wide margin. being the biggest fish in the sea it can create the biggest network effect. the more people use an app the higher the value it generates for its users. the biggest concern that many have is meta. as facebook and instagram are dominating worldwide in theory these apps should be able to capture a large portion of the market quickly. however the reality is different 1. facebook dating was launched back in 2019 and it hasn t been a huge success. 2. facebook was founded back in 2004 . it has been two decades and mark zuckerberg has now focused on the metaverse. it is quite clear that targeting this market isn t a priority for meta at this very moment. it doesn t mean it will never be but the chances seem quite slim. 4.0 valuation based on my assumptions the fair value of the company is $14 billion slightly above the current share price of $34. the two key assumptions i have are 1. revenue growth of 54 over the next decade i think this is fairly conservative. the change in demographics combined with price increases makes this easily achievable. 2. operating margin of 26 this is below their historical average and assumes the management continues with the current level of r d. here s how the valuation changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth over the next decade and the operating margin revenue operating margin 26 28 30 cagr 54 $39 $43 $47 4.4 75 $44 $49 $54 5.8 100 $51 $56 $61 7.2 as i m writing this the share price is $34. if the company grows its revenue at 4 cagr the market expects its profitability to decrease below 26 . if the profitability remains at 26 the market expects the revenue to grow below 4 year. based on the analysis above i don t see data that supports any of the two scenarios above. i hope you enjoyed this post feel free to share your thoughts.,deep dive match group $mtch deep dive match group $mtch [TITLE_END] 1.0 introduction match group

hefty ai spending is already paying off [TITLE_END] this is a pretty long article but i think it is an important read since it answers the key question is anyone making significant money from ai right now clearly the answer is yes for meta. for easier reading i tried to bold the parts the discuss ai specifically. source for investors who are skeptical of meta s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon ceo mark zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present. after the company s better than expected second quarter earnings report on wednesday zuckerberg and finance chief susan li rattled off all the ways that ai has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market meta s core business. the ways that it s improving recommendations and helping people find better content as well as making the advertising experiences more effective i think there s a lot of upside there zuckerberg said on the earnings call. those are already products that are at scale . the ai work that we re doing is going to improve that. meta reported revenue growth of 22 from a year earlier to $39.07 billion with 98 of its sales coming from advertising primarily on facebook and instagram. its growth rate was double that of google s ad business which saw sales increase 11 to $64.6 billion alphabet said in its earnings report last week. meanwhile pinterest and spotify which are both significantly smaller than meta reported revenue growth of 21 and 20 respectively in their latest reports. as in previous quarters li said meta s advertising business benefited from online commerce gaming and the media and entertainment sectors and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the asia pacific region. she said the company s improved ad performance helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region. zuckerberg pointed to ai as the foundation behind meta s refreshed online advertising platform which was battered after apple introduced an ios privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the internet. they rebuilt their ad tech stack using ai and they changed their user interface and generated a lot more user engagement because of ai said mark mahaney internet analyst at evercore isi in an interview on cnbc s closing bell overtime on wednesday. it s showing up in the revenue and the profits now said mahaney who recommends buying meta shares. meta shares popped 7 in extended trading after wednesday s earnings report which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter. like the other mega cap tech companies meta is spending billions of dollars on nvidia s graphics processing units which are needed to train ai models and run hefty workloads. some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative ai popularized by openai s chatgpt will lead to big revenue gains in the future. already seen a return meta is showing that while the bet is on major growth down the road the company is reaping rewards today . you ve already seen a return with meta over the last two years mahaney said. angelo zino an analyst at cfra research agreed with mahaney telling cnbc that meta has really navigated some of the concerns and the storms from a couple years ago and is clearly integrating ai across their ecosystem extremely nicely . zino noted that meta s growth rates are nicely outpacing those of its peers . meta isn t finished spending big money on ai and the far flung metaverse which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. li said that meta expects significant capex growth in 2025 as we invest to support our ai research and our product development efforts. for 2024 meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion lifting the low end of that range which had been $35 billion . li says investors should think of meta s ai strategy as a two pronged approach with core ai helping meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that have translated into revenue gains. generative ai is a longer term bet. li said that the company doesn t expect our gen ai products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in 24 but we do expect that they re going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.,cnbc meta s advertising growth proof hefty ai spending

in the s p analyzing the analysts using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the s p [TITLE_END] hello everyone i m a lazy investor and don t like to do much due diligence but i do like to make money. unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as i ve lost money in the past for not doing my dd. as such i continue to be lazy but i try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. one such way that i have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. in essence i try to just have these analysts do the work for me. an idea i had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it s price action and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you ll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy i have a thesis that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. now i know that anyone who has read this far already thinks i m an idiot. many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor i m stupid for following their lead but i would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. as much as i have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates there is still much i don t know as i don t have a finance or economics degree. moreover as bad as you may think an analyst is they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. lastly and most importantly what i am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so i m not relying on a single analyst but several . i think if two dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. so what i did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 s p 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on yahoo finance. i then divided the current stock price by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. then i also listed how many total ratings each company had and how many of them were strong buys and buys . this yielded the following table a b c d e f g h 1 company current price price target percent to target total ratings strong buy ratings buy ratings of ratings that were strong buys 2 aapl 222.08 209.76 105.87 38 11 21 28.95 3 msft 418.35 459.66 91.01 34 14 13 41.18 4 nvda 117.02 125.69 93.10 38 14 15 36.84 5 amzn 186.98 206.43 90.58 47 15 28 31.91 6 meta

analyzing the analysts using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the s p [TITLE_END] hello everyone i m a lazy investor and don t like to do much due diligence but i do like to make money. unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as i ve lost money in the past for not doing my dd. as such i continue to be lazy but i try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. one such way that i have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. in essence i try to just have these analysts do the work for me. an idea i had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it s price action and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you ll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy i have a thesis that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. now i know that anyone who has read this far already thinks i m an idiot. many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor i m stupid for following their lead but i would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. as much as i have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates there is still much i don t know as i don t have a finance or economics degree. moreover as bad as you may think an analyst is they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. lastly and most importantly what i am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so i m not relying on a single analyst but several . i think if two dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. so what i did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 s p 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on yahoo finance. i then divided the current stock price by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. then i also listed how many total ratings each company had and how many of them were strong buys and buys . this yielded the following table a b c d e f g h 1 company current price price target percent to target total ratings strong buy ratings buy ratings of ratings that were strong buys 2 aapl 222.08 209.76 105.87 38 11 21 28.95 3 msft 418.35 459.66 91.01 34 14 13 41.18 4 nvda 117.02 125.69 93.10 38 14 15 36.84 5 amzn 186.98 206.43 90.58 47 15 28 31.91 6 meta

analyzing the analysts using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the s p [TITLE_END] hello everyone i m a lazy investor and don t like to do much due diligence but i do like to make money. unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as i ve lost money in the past for not doing my dd. as such i continue to be lazy but i try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. one such way that i have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. in essence i try to just have these analysts do the work for me. the idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it s price action and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you ll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy i have a thesis that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. now i know that anyone who has read this far already thinks i m an idiot. many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore i m stupid for following their lead but i would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. as much as i have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates there is still much i don t know as i don t have a finance or economics degree. moreover as bad as you may think an analyst is they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. lastly and most importantly what i am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so i m not relying on a single analyst but several . i think if two dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. so what i did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 s p 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on yahoo finance. i then divided the current stock price by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. then i also listed how many total ratings each company had and how many of them were strong buys and buys . this yielded the following table a b c d e f g h 1 company current price price target percent to target total ratings strong buy ratings buy ratings of ratings that were strong buys 2 aapl 222.08 209.76 105.87 38 11 21 28.95 3 msft 418.35 459.66 91.01 34 14 13 41.18 4 nvda 117.02 125.69 93.10 38 14 15 36.84 5 amzn 186.98 206.43 90.58 47 15 28 31.91 6 meta

diligence but i do like to make money. unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as i ve lost money in the past for not doing my dd. as such i continue to be lazy but i try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. one such way that i have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. in essence i try to just have these analysts do the work for me. the idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it s price action and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you ll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy i have a thesis that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. now i know that anyone who has read this far already thinks i m an idiot. many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore i m stupid for following their lead but i would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. as much as i have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates there is still much i don t know as i don t have a finance or economics degree. moreover as bad as you may think an analyst is they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. lastly and most importantly what i am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so i m not relying on a single analyst but several . i think if two dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. so what i did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 s p 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on yahoo finance. i then divided the current stock price by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. then i also listed how many total ratings each company had and how many of them were strong buys and buys . this yielded the following table a b c d e f g h 1 company current price price target percent to target total ratings strong buy ratings buy ratings of ratings that were strong buys 2

and don t like to do much due diligence but i do like to make money. unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as i ve lost money in the past for not doing my dd. as such i continue to be lazy but i try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. one such way that i have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. in essence i try to just have these analysts do the work for me. an idea i had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it s price action and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you ll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy i have a thesis that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. now i know that anyone who has read this far already thinks i m an idiot. many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor i m stupid for following their lead but i would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. as much as i have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates there is still much i don t know as i don t have a finance or economics degree. moreover as bad as you may think an analyst is they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. lastly and most importantly what i am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so i m not relying on a single analyst but several . i think if two dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. so what i did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 s p 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on yahoo finance. i then divided the current stock price by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. then i also listed how many total ratings each company had and how many of them were strong buys and buys . this yielded the following table a b c d e f g h 1 company current price price target percent to target total ratings strong buy ratings buy ratings of ratings that were strong buys 2 aapl 222.08 209.76 105.87 38 11 21 28.95 3 msft 418.35 459.66 91.01 34 14 13 41.18 4 nvda 117.02 125.69 93.10 38 14 15 36.84 5 amzn 186.98 206.43 90.58 47 15 28 31.91 6 meta

like to do much due diligence but i do like to make money. unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as i ve lost money in the past for not doing my dd. as such i continue to be lazy but i try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. one such way that i have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. in essence i try to just have these analysts do the work for me. an idea i had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it s price action and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you ll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy i have a thesis that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. now i know that anyone who has read this far already thinks i m an idiot. many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor i m stupid for following their lead but i would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. as much as i have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates there is still much i don t know as i don t have a finance or economics degree. moreover as bad as you may think an analyst is they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. lastly and most importantly what i am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so i m not relying on a single analyst but several . i think if two dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. so what i did

push for electric vehicles and renewable energy infrastructure significantly boosts copper demand. copper prices have risen approximately 6.54 since the beginning of 2024. analysts predict copper prices could reach $11 000 per metric ton by the end of 2024 driven by increased demand and potential supply constraints. the stock market is facing uncertainty with turbulent days ahead. tesla s recent missed earnings demonstrate how even major players can experience corrections and return to more expected levels. some experts suggest that the market may be undergoing a shift. while the exchanges might be fluctuating it could be wise to take a cautious approach and consider safer investments. however this doesn t mean you should only invest in assets with low potential growth. you might consider exploring small cap but promising companies as well as mining exploration firms with significant potential. these investments could offer opportunities for growth while still managing risk. what commodity should you look after while gold is here and represents one of the safest commodities in the world another one is emerging as a top asset. it is not silver but copper. why copper is essential for the modern world playing a crucial role in various industries due to its excellent electrical conductivity and thermal properties. copper is a critical component in the production of electrical wiring electronics and renewable energy systems including solar panels and wind turbines. as the world transitions to greener energy sources the demand for copper is expected to soar. the push for electric vehicles is another major driver as each ev requires significantly more copper than a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle. additionally the expansion of 5g networks and increasing urbanization are set to further boost copper demand. copper has experienced a notable price increase over the past six months gaining approximately 6.54 since the beginning of 2024. this rise is attributed to growing demand from sectors like electric vehicles renewable energy infrastructure and general electronics all of which heavily rely on copper due to its superior electrical conductivity and thermal properties . looking ahead the outlook for copper remains optimistic. analysts predict that copper prices could continue to climb potentially reaching $11 000 per metric ton by the end of 2024. this anticipated growth is driven by an expected increase in global demand particularly from green energy initiatives and infrastructure projects. additionally potential supply constraints from major copper producing regions like chile and peru could further tighten the market supporting higher prices . introducing world copper world copper ltd. headquartered in vancouver bc is a canadian resource company specializing in the exploration and development of significant copper porphyry projects. the company s primary assets include the zonia project in arizona and the escalones project in chile. world copper also aims to capitalize on these assets by continuing to explore and expand the known mineralization leveraging its experienced team and strategic positioning

iphone. let me be clear at this point apple intelligence isn t that. now it s true that this is just the first beta release and the company will undoubtedly improve it over the next few months. but i suspect that we re seeing a fairly good picture of what apple intelligence will look like when it debuts around october. i found the ability to summarize emails to be useful it provided an excellent distillation of the message s content. this is particularly a perk for message previews which typically just show the first few lines of an email. but the summaries of text message conversations particularly for fast moving group chats were a disappointment and mostly useless. summaries are also helpful in safari for articles but i don t foresee that being a particularly popular feature. the most impressive features so far are writing tools type to siri and phone call recording summaries. the writing tools are essentially a well integrated version of grammarly style features. it works

2024-08-04,2024-08-04 18:52:31,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,my thoughts on meta my thoughts on meta [TITLE_END] i d like to start a dialogue on what investors think about meta please challenge or add onto this discussion. this is a long post so i ve posted the tldr below. given the recent negative non farm jobs report and unemployment prints i think the market is missing a great opportunity in meta stock after a great earnings report. context meta pre earnings was about $470 and post earnings is now $488. they beat earnings by 8 . meta is down from its high of $540. position i have sold some meta puts at lower strike points so yes i am biased and want the company to perform well but will change my mind if there s a compelling argument otherwise. first thoughts on the market the sell off is a correction that gives long term investors an opportunity to buy companies at a less inflated p e ratio. i think recession concerns are overblown given the following absolute levels of unemployment remain very low meeting inflation targets are important for encouraging discretionary spending for lower income populations so that buying power won t be continuously eroded and we can move past this tightening cycle the fed has the ability to reduce interest rates significantly if warranted reduction in mortgage rates will allow existing homeowners to reduce interest burden and increase discretionary spending and stimulate big ticket purchases reduced bond yields means equities become more attractive in comparison. in the short run the carry trade has largely unwinded from its highs in july 2024 and further downside risk is less than before meta specific thoughts earnings just crushed earnings expectations their advertising business continues to run strong with user base growth. they stated that they have seen early benefits from their capex spend on ai . reasonable valuation in the short run currently trading at 25 pe and forward pe is 21 to 24 depending on eps forecasts. for context meta hit its lowest pe of 14 in december 2022 when people thought meta wouldn t exist anymore due to ad spend concerns apple privacy updates and issues with facebook engagement. compared to other tech companies investing in ai meta has one of the lowest p es with a comparable growth rate. relative to its peers its peg ratio is lower as well. however i think some of this difference is explained by its reliance on ad spend which is cyclical and less resilient in downturns. long term bets meta has invested in long term bets in ai and virtual reality which have yet to pay off and are considered a cost burden. for example in their recent earnings call they ve talked about using ai stand in personas to help influencers and small businesses answer questions to followers. if they become the small business or personal ai then they can deepen relationships with users and monetize in ways beyond ads through reoccuring services revenue. reoccuring revenue and proving monetization of ai will give it a boost in eps given investors value this type of revenue more. i believe meta is trying to move away from reliance on ads and provide value to users in ways that cannot be pulled away as easily spending risks capex is large which has a future drag on eps but i think they can scrap their vr initiatives if needed if cost efficiency is required. if ai doesn t work out eps growth will be harmed in the outer years . economic risks short term dependence on ad spend which is cylical and impacted during recessions chinese companies spending a lot on meta for ads this might go away i think given interest rates are coming down hopefully any softness will be alleviated quickly. tldr short term business is reasonably valued and forward valuations aren t priced for explosive ai monetization. this results in upside both from an eps and p e perspective if there is no prolonged economic downturn and especially if new ai products show early chutes of monetization. would appreciate any thoughts challenges to this from other investors.,thoughts meta thoughts meta [TITLE_END] d like start dialogue investors think meta challenge add discussion. long

2024-08-06,2024-08-06 19:05:28,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,possible bullish thesis on hertz possible bullish thesis on hertz [TITLE_END] i know i know investors or traders have gotten the shaft on this ticker but hear me out. hertz ran into more issues post covid travel restrictions when tesla marked down the price of their vehicles and accelerated the depreciation of said assets on their books . there has also been seasonality regarding sales profitability and consumer spending is relatively contractionary for the overall sector. their earnings have obviously been unsatisfactory and there s been leadership and financial restructuring to try get things back on track. idc about any of that really what i care about is the strategic mistake to accelerate the sale of their evs given the low utilization rate of evs by their customers in the hertz fleet. hertz is positioned to have one of the largest robo taxi fleets in the world second to only tesla themselves to my knowledge and tesla can t position fleets everywhere yet . after tesla began seriously teasing investors with the idea companies like lyft and uber corrected hard while hertz reached a bottom $3 share with upside volatility characteristics. hertz is trading at well below book value and the pp e depreciation will decelerate once teslas become a profitable investment . the low utilization rate by hertz s customers will be moot if the fleet is automatically participating robo ridesharing. they will be utilized at least more so than previous reporting periods. if hertz slows or ceases selling their evs for short term liquidity once robo taxi platform rolls out hertz has a new revenue stream with their existing assets. the depreciation will slow or reverse their low utilization rate will subside and their profitability will increase dramatically. there s a lot of ifs in this scenario but if this happens i think hertz will at least trade at book value indicating over 75 upside by the end of this year. if profitability continued to grow from robo taxi fees and if hertz accomplishes higher profitability over the next several years from this while increasing utilization rates their eps will go profitable again which if sustainable we re looking at over $10 20 share in the coming years. what are your thoughts do you see value in this thesis do you have a strong counter argument looking forward to your thoughts. thanks,possible bullish thesis hertz possible bullish thesis hertz [TITLE_END] know know investors traders gotten shaft ticker hear out. hertz ran issues post covid travel restrictions tesla marked price vehicles accelerated depreciation said assets books . seasonality regarding sales profitability consumer spending relatively contractionary overall sector. earnings obviously unsatisfactory s leadership financial restructuring try things track. idc really care strategic mistake accelerate sale evs given low utilization rate evs customers hertz fleet. hertz positioned largest robo taxi fleets world second tesla knowledge tesla t position fleets . tesla began seriously teasing investors idea companies like lyft uber corrected hard hertz reached $3 share upside volatility characteristics. hertz trading book value pp e depreciation decelerate teslas profitable investment . low utilization rate hertz s customers moot fleet automatically participating robo ridesharing. utilized previous reporting periods. hertz slows ceases selling evs short term liquidity robo taxi platform rolls hertz new revenue stream existing assets. depreciation slow reverse low utilization rate subside profitability increase dramatically. s lot ifs scenario happens think hertz trade book value indicating 75 upside end year. profitability continued grow robo taxi fees hertz accomplishes higher profitability years increasing utilization rates eps profitable sustainable looking $10 20 share coming years. thoughts value thesis strong counter argument looking forward thoughts. thanks,0

[TITLE_END] european drugstore giant rossmann announced tuesday it will no longer buy tesla s electric vehicles for its fleet effective immediately citing ceo elon musk s pro trump political support. rossmann based in germany said in a statement that its decision was based on the incompatibility between the statements of tesla ceo elon musk and the values that tesla represents with its products. elon musk makes no secret of his support for donald trump raoul rossmann a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. trump has repeatedly described climate change as a hoax this attitude is in stark contrast to tesla s mission to contribute to environmental protection through the production of electric cars. while rossmann only purchases about 180 electric vehicles a year and only had 38 teslas in its fleet according to bloomberg the company s decision to cut all tesla ev purchases shows that musk s political decisions have begun to impact the automaker well beyond the u.s. musk formally endorsed trump last month and said he was contributing funds to a pro trump group he helped create called america pac. musk is also slated to interview the former president trump announced on tuesday. during a debate with president biden in june former president trump dodged questions about what he would do if anything to combat climate change. and trump has called climate change a hoax. he has also promised to withdraw the u.s. from the paris climate agreement as he did during his presidency if he is re elected in november. according to ongoing research by morning consult republicans in the u.s. began to view musk more favorably following his leveraged buyout of twitter in late 2022. however this has not driven an increase in republican s purchasing consideration of electric vehicles here. according to pew research musk s reputation with left leaning voters has declined even though they are far more likely to purchase an ev. rossman s decision follows a recent survey that found a deterioration in tesla s brand attributed partly to musk s antics and political rants. while tesla s revenue increased 2 during the second quarter automotive revenue dropped 7 to $19.9 billion from $21.27 billion in the same quarter a year ago. tesla opened a factory in 2022 in brandenburg germany and employs thousands in the country. at the end of 2023 the drugstore chain rossmann reported that it had more than 4 700 stores and more than 60 000 employees with about half in germany. tesla has faced protests by environmental activists in germany who took issue with the company s plans to cut down part of a forest and to use water for manufacturing in brandenburg. musk lashed out at protesters there saying on x in march they re either the dumbest eco terrorists on earth or they re puppets of those who don t have good environmental goals. tesla musk and representatives for rossmann did not respond to requests for further details on thursday morning. source,elon musk s support

2024-08-14,2024-08-14 08:37:45,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,the consumer recession of 2023 2024 and the future the consumer recession of 2023 2024 and the future [TITLE_END] alright so this going to be a long post so bear with me. i think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. now you re probably thinking ok but how gdp continues to grow unemployment continues to be stable and the market is higher than ever right now. i am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory. 1. microsoft now you re probably wondering why this is the first company i am bringing up when microsoft grew revenue and income. microsoft grew revenue by 10 and net income by 20 . microsoft does both software and hardware. the software parts of the business like office cloud and services increased substantially. however when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. device revenue decreased 20 . these are things like personal computers accessories and other electronics that microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. gaming revenue decreased by 5 with xbox hardware sales falling 11 . we are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. people are pulling back on items like pcs and gaming consoles. now you re probably thinking yeah random redditor not everybody buys pcs xboxs every year. this means nothing. so now we go to our next company. 2. apple like microsoft apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. if you don t personally use them you know someone who uses their products. if we look at apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. hardware sales were down across the board. macs iphones ipads and wearables all declined. however no what didn t decline services. like microsoft services grew for apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. now you re probably thinking yeah random redditor but apple isn t cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. so that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things. ok let s keep going. 3. nike nike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. like apple if you don t use their products you personally know someone who uses them. they re everywhere. nike reported a decline in revenue by 2 in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10 drop in q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. we saw nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and it s expected to get worse in 2025. the stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides covid these levels haven t been seen since 2018. now you re probably thinking ok random redditor but nike isn t cool anymore and adidas is better and sells more track suits to the eastern europeans. so it makes sense why it s down. ok lets look at more. 4. home depot and lowe s the two home building retailer giants of the us. if you own a home or have done work on your home you re familiar with these 2 companies. these 2 companies are staples to the entire us economy. similar to ups and fedex if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing you re paying attention to these two companies as they re crucial to its health. in 2023 we saw home depots sales decrease by 3 and earnings decrease by 9.5 . we just saw home depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. we saw a similar result for lowe s. they reported a net sales decrease of 11 and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. with expectations being another 2 3 fall in comparable sales. both home depot and lowe s stock are still down from their highs in 2021. home depot is down 16 and lowe s down 10 which was close to 3 years ago. now you re probably thinking ok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about. ok how about another one. 5. target target is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. target is the upperclass walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies i mention they appeal to the middle high class. in 2023 target reported a sales decline of 1.7 and a comparable sales decline of 3.7 . full year revenue decreased by 1.7 . the company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. target stock is currently down 48 from its high with its high being in 2021. i can really keep going with this. here is some more. 1. estee lauder massive stock decline 2. ulta beauty massive stock decline 3. ups massive stock decline 4. lululemon massive stock decline 5. dollar general massive stock decline 6. hershey massive stock decline 7. starbucks massive stock decline now what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about these are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. now we are seeing the middle class consumer pull back on these products. maybe you re not buying the next microsoft pc this year or the new iphone or the new pair of nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas. this is causing the market to price in future bad results and causing the stock price to crash. we are seeing a case where the market is not reflecting the economy. businesses all across various industries are showing declines across the board and it s only expected to get worse. now with all these declines in other industries why is the market so high the answer is tech. companies like nvidia google amazon microsoft apple meta broadcom qualcomm amd etc. are dominating the market. with these stocks continuing to increase and other stocks continuing to decrease it s only getting worse. they have a heavy weight on the indexes and they re causing most of the gains in the index while we are seeing other sectors decline. this has caused tech valuations to soar and other areas of the market to lag. now what does this mean going forward. are we due for a massive decline in the market where we see tech finally come down i personally don t think so. however i think going forward we won t see the returns that tech has given now going forward. i think these stock declines in the market has presented opportunities and we can possibly see a sector rotation. for example the fed cutting rates and alleviating pressure on the consumer. a case where tech lags behind and we see other areas of the market which have fallen start to climb. i could be wrong on this but these are just my thoughts. let me know what you think about this theory.,consumer recession 2023 2024 future consumer recession 2023 2024 future [TITLE_END] alright going long post bear me. think currently consumer recession right now. probably thinking ok gdp continues grow unemployment continues stable market higher right now. going talk companies hopefully support theory. 1. microsoft probably wondering company bringing microsoft grew revenue income. microsoft grew revenue 10 net income 20 . microsoft does software hardware. software parts business like office cloud services increased substantially. look hardware business paints different picture. device revenue decreased 20 . things like personal computers accessories electronics microsoft sells business declined considerably. gaming revenue decreased 5 xbox hardware sales falling 11 . currently seeing similar trend 2024. people pulling items like pcs gaming consoles. probably thinking yeah random redditor everybody buys pcs xboxs year. means nothing. company. 2. apple like microsoft apple big tech company integrated society day consumer. don t personally use know uses products. look apples results 2023 look product sales declined 316.1 billion 298 billion. hardware sales board. macs iphones ipads wearables declined. didn t decline services. like microsoft services grew apple 78.1 billion 85.2 billion. seeing pattern physical products appeal middle class consumer fall. probably thinking yeah random redditor apple isn t cool anymore course products selling. makes sense means grand scheme things. ok let s going. 3. nike nike global fashion biggest world biggest. like apple don t use products personally know uses them. everywhere. nike reported decline revenue 2 2024 currently forecasting 10 drop q1 2025 drop year 2025. saw nike report product declines like shoes 2024 s expected worse 2025. stock currently sitting multi year low covid levels haven t seen 2018. probably

could stymie the ai chipmaker in chief if today s stockmarkets have their version of the great wildebeest migration it is the stampede of the nvidia bulls. wall street is no serengeti and jim cramer s high pitched narration no match for the dulcet tones of sir david attenborough. but in other respects investors headlong rush into the american chipmaker s shares has been every bit as enthralling a spectacle. galloping sales of nvidia s artificial intelligence processors have lifted its market capitalisation from $350bn at the start of 2023 to $1trn then $2trn and then this summer $3trn. in june it overtook microsoft an ai zealous software giant believed to be the biggest buyer of its chips as it proceeded to lose that title and $900bn in value amid the recent stockmarket panic only to claw back most of its losses in the past few weeks. as the firm prepares to report its latest results on august 28th just about everyone expects another blow out quarter. how much money have you made over the years betting against jensen huang mr cramer asked rhetorically on his cnbc show last week referring to nvidia s boss. these days the nvidia bear appears to be an endangered species. or as sir david might whisper not an ursus nvidiaensis in sight. for every hedge fund that trims its stake in the company another seems to do the opposite. of the 74 wall street analysts who cover nvidia and are tracked by bloomberg 66 advise buying more of its shares none suggests selling. their average price target for the stock one year from now implies a market value of around $3.5trn. james anderson a veteran tech investor who was an early backer teases that nvidia could be worth $49trn in a decade a shade more than the total value today of the s p 500 index of large american firms. all it would take is consistent annual sales growth of 60 at current operating margins of 60 or so plus some plausible assumptions about cashflow. investment bankers at jefferies goldman sachs and ubs project that nvidia s yearly revenues will double this year to over $100bn grow by as much as half in 2025 and by double digits until at least 2027. by then its operating profit could exceed $150bn a third more than apple tech s most successful money spinner managed last year. the numbers are getting so big so fast that this alone should give the bulls pause. as they catch their breath they might wish to ruminate on two contradictions lurking in nvidia s long term growth story. the first concerns its main supplier. nvidia but does not produce them. that falls to a taiwanese contract chipmaker that dominates the market for the cutting edge silicon that goes into ai servers. as demand for these has rocketed nvidia has gone from one among many of tsmc s clients to probably its second biggest behind apple. if it is indeed customer b one of two that represent at least 10 of tsmc s revenues and must thus be disclosed in regulatory filings it spent $7.7bn with tsmc last year up from $5.5bn two years earlier. given that most of nvidia s purchase commitments of $19bn for 2025 are likely to end up with tsmc it could soon eclipse the current customer a which handed the taiwanese firm just shy of $18bn in 2023. even as nvidia s and tsmc s fates become more entwined however their product cycles are diverging. earlier this year mr huang vowed to launch a new and improved ai chip every year rather than every couple of years. tsmc is therefore in a mad rush to expand capacity pledging to invest up to $32bn this year and possibly more in 2025. but it still needs at least 18 months to erect a new factory. and because these can cost $20bn a pop careful discussions with clients typically start a year or two in advance. it is unclear how nvidia s accelerated timeline fits in with tsmc s more measured pace of decision making. in an early sign of trouble nvidia has delayed shipments of its latest chips called blackwell by a couple of months owing to technical kinks. nvidia s reliance on tsmc also highlights the second tension in the bulls case. because the manufacturer controls the volume and efficiency of production the only way for nvidia to ensure that it meets investors bullish expectations for sales is to raise prices. a blackwell chip will cost 20 25 more than the earlier generation which was twice the price of the one before. each chip is more powerful than the last so the cost per unit of computing power is probably declining. but not fast enough for customers. in august andy jassy chief executive of amazon whose cloud computing arm is a big user of nvidia chips acknowledged that he had heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance . his company is investing in its own designs. so are google meta microsoft and tesla. a rival chip designer has gone from almost no ai chip sales in 2022 to a forecast $5bn this year. on august 19th it said it would buy zt systems a server maker helping it to compete with nvidia s end to end offering. chinese tech champions such as huawei barred by american sanctions from procuring top end nvidia gear may forge breakthroughs that could do to nvidia s market share what chinese competitors like byd did to tesla s in electric cars. exit pursued by a bear assuming a killer app eventually emerges which it hasn t yet generative ai is unlikely to become widely used unless it gets much cheaper a chatgpt query can cost seven times more to answer than google search. nvidia may soon have to choose between lowering prices to support its growth or maintaining prices to protect its profit margin. for now nvidia bulls think they can have it both ways. the whiff of irrational exuberance may become too overwhelming for u. nvidiaensis to resist.,stop nvdia frenzy stop nvdia frenzy

2024-08-27,2024-08-27 19:20:30,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,what could stop the nvdia frenzy what could stop the nvdia frenzy [TITLE_END] what could stop the nvidia frenzy two contradictions could stymie the ai chipmaker in chief if today s stockmarkets have their version of the great wildebeest migration it is the stampede of the nvidia bulls. wall street is no serengeti and jim cramer s high pitched narration no match for the dulcet tones of sir david attenborough. but in other respects investors headlong rush into the american chipmaker s shares has been every bit as enthralling a spectacle. galloping sales of nvidia s artificial intelligence processors have lifted its market capitalisation from $350bn at the start of 2023 to $1trn then $2trn and then this summer $3trn. in june it overtook microsoft an ai zealous software giant believed to be the biggest buyer of its chips as it proceeded to lose that title and $900bn in value amid the recent stockmarket panic only to claw back most of its losses in the past few weeks. as the firm prepares to report its latest results on august 28th just about everyone expects another blow out quarter. how much money have you made over the years betting against jensen huang mr cramer asked rhetorically on his cnbc show last week referring to nvidia s boss. these days the nvidia bear appears to be an endangered species. or as sir david might whisper not an ursus nvidiaensis in sight. for every hedge fund that trims its stake in the company another seems to do the opposite. of the 74 wall street analysts who cover nvidia and are tracked by bloomberg 66 advise buying more of its shares none suggests selling. their average price target for the stock one year from now implies a market value of around $3.5trn. james anderson a veteran tech investor who was an early backer teases that nvidia could be worth $49trn in a decade a shade more than the total value today of the s p 500 index of large american firms. all it would take is consistent annual sales growth of 60 at current operating margins of 60 or so plus some plausible assumptions about cashflow. investment bankers at jefferies goldman sachs and ubs project that nvidia s yearly revenues will double this year to over $100bn grow by as much as half in 2025 and by double digits until at least 2027. by then its operating profit could exceed $150bn a third more than apple tech s most successful money spinner managed last year. the numbers are getting so big so fast that this alone should give the bulls pause. as they catch their breath they might wish to ruminate on two contradictions lurking in nvidia s long term growth story. the first concerns its main supplier. nvidia but does not produce them. that falls to a taiwanese contract chipmaker that dominates the market for the cutting edge silicon that goes into ai servers. as demand for these has rocketed nvidia has gone from one among many of tsmc s clients to probably its second biggest behind apple. if it is indeed customer b one of two that represent at least 10 of tsmc s revenues and must thus be disclosed in regulatory filings it spent $7.7bn with tsmc last year up from $5.5bn two years earlier. given that most of nvidia s purchase commitments of $19bn for 2025 are likely to end up with tsmc it could soon eclipse the current customer a which handed the taiwanese firm just shy of $18bn in 2023. even as nvidia s and tsmc s fates become more entwined however their product cycles are diverging. earlier this year mr huang vowed to launch a new and improved ai chip every year rather than every couple of years. tsmc is therefore in a mad rush to expand capacity pledging to invest up to $32bn this year and possibly more in 2025. but it still needs at least 18 months to erect a new factory. and because these can cost $20bn a pop careful discussions with clients typically start a year or two in advance. it is unclear how nvidia s accelerated timeline fits in with tsmc s more measured pace of decision making. in an early sign of trouble nvidia has delayed shipments of its latest chips called blackwell by a couple of months owing to technical kinks. nvidia s reliance on tsmc also highlights the second tension in the bulls case. because the manufacturer controls the volume and efficiency of production the only way for nvidia to ensure that it meets investors bullish expectations for sales is to raise prices. a blackwell chip will cost 20 25 more than the earlier generation which was twice the price of the one before. each chip is more powerful than the last so the cost per unit of computing power is probably declining. but not fast enough for customers. in august andy jassy chief executive of amazon whose cloud computing arm is a big user of nvidia chips acknowledged that he had heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance . his company is investing in its own designs. so are google meta microsoft and tesla. a rival chip designer has gone from almost no ai chip sales in 2022 to a forecast $5bn this year. on august 19th it said it would buy zt systems a server maker helping it to compete with nvidia s end to end offering. chinese tech champions such as huawei barred by american sanctions from procuring top end nvidia gear may forge breakthroughs that could do to nvidia s market share what chinese competitors like byd did to tesla s in electric cars. exit pursued by a bear assuming a killer app eventually emerges which it hasn t yet generative ai is unlikely to become widely used unless it gets much cheaper a chatgpt query can cost seven times more to answer than google search. nvidia may soon have to choose between lowering prices to support its growth or maintaining prices to protect its profit margin. for now nvidia bulls think they can have it both ways. the whiff of irrational exuberance may become too overwhelming for u. nvidiaensis to resist.,stop nvdia frenzy stop nvdia frenzy

tests disappoint [TITLE_END] sept 4 intel s contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker broadcom failed three sources familiar with the matter told reuters dealing a blow to the company s turnaround efforts. the tests conducted by broadcom involved sending silicon wafers the foot wide discs on which chips are printed through intel s most advanced manufacturing process known as 18a the sources said. broadcom received the wafers back from intel last month. after its engineers and executives studied the results the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high volume production. reuters could not determine the current relationship between broadcom and intel or whether broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal. intel 18a is powered on healthy and yielding well and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year an intel spokesperson said in a statement. there is a great deal of interest in intel 18a across the industry but as a matter of policy we do not comment on specific customer conversations. a broadcom spokesperson said the company is evaluating the product and service offerings of intel foundry and have not concluded that evaluation. intel s contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of chief executive pat gelsinger s turnaround strategy. broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. it has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware and j.p. morgan analyst harlan sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from ai this year up from $4 billion last year. some of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as alphabet s google and meta platforms to help produce in house ai processors which can include arrangements with a manufacturer such as intel or taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co . crucial setback as part of a disastrous second quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company s market value intel announced a 15 job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid september on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs reuters reported on sunday. intel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the u.s. a crucial part of the company s expansion includes attracting big customers such as nvidia or apple to fill up capacity at all its new sites. intel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027. typically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1 000 separate steps inside a chip factory or fab and takes roughly three months to complete. production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers. broadcom s engineers had concerns with the viability of the process the sources said. typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated. for an advanced manufacturing process used by tsmc the taiwanese giant charges roughly $23 000 per wafer at high volume according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. reuters could not determine intel s wafer pricing. tsmc declined to comment on its wafer pricing. moving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as tsmc to another vendor such as samsung or intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology. betting on a new manufacturing process such as intel s 18a is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have. intel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18a process to other chipmakers over the summer gelsinger said on an earnings call last month. the company plans to be manufacturing ready by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025 gelsinger said. at an investor conference last week he said there are a dozen customers actively engaged with the tool kit.,intel manufacturing business suffers setback broadcom tests disappoint intel manufacturing business suffers setback broadcom tests disappoint

heels of weak manufacturing data. that could put increased importance on the jobless claims data bmo wealth management chief investment officer yung yu ma said on closing bell. that s more of a forward looking indicator. as long as those stay low people have jobs people remain confident in the ability to find jobs or comfortable in the jobs that they have we think that they will continue to spend. so as long as those numbers stay low if we get some blips in the overall monthly jobs report that shows weakness on the edges we re not quite as concerned ma said. the employment data could play a key role in the federal reserve s interest rate decision later this month. ma said he still believes the u.s. economy is on track for a soft landing and that the market rally should eventually broaden out. however he added that there is likely to be continued market turbulence in the near term. we believe in it we just think it s going to be on pause for a few months because this high degree of uncertainty we have right now. there s just too much that needs to resolved over the coming months. it s just very hard for the broadening of the market theme to really gather momentum ma

2024-09-06,2024-09-06 10:33:43,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",trading,research and detailed analysis on high tide inc $hiti research and detailed analysis on high tide inc $hiti [TITLE_END] background how became the leading cannabis retailer in canada the beginning raj grover the founder and ceo who owns 9 of the company and has never sold a single share comes from an entrepreneurial family and had already experienced success with several smaller businesses before establishing during a business trip to india in search of opportunities in fashion accessories or body jewelry raj stumbled upon the potential of cannabis consumption accessories. recognizing the margin arbitrage opportunity he shipped $10 000 worth of consumption accessories from new delhi to canada and sold everything overnight. after replicating this success a few more times raj decided to open a store. this marked the beginning of high tide s story . in 2009 raj opened smokers corner with an initial investment of less than $50 000 and grew it into a multimillion dollar empire. at that time there were only two or three competitors with unappealing stores. raj believed that by creating a differentiated store in a smart location he could easily capture market share and he was right. by leveraging his established roots in indonesia thailand china and india he was able to not only provide a better customer experience but also offer much cheaper products. cannabis legalization in canada always looking to stay ahead raj seized the opportunity when the prime minister of canada announced that recreational cannabis would soon be legalized. with an existing customer base of cannabis users it made perfect sense for raj to expand into selling cannabis itself. he realized that if he only sold accessories he would eventually lose customers to shops that offered both cannabis and accessories. after nine years of focusing on consumption accessories and accumulating nearly $10m in retained earnings raj raised $88.5m for the first time in 2018 and ventured into the equity markets marking the beginning of high tide s journey as a publicly traded company . with easier access to capital when compared to its peers high tide expanded its footprint across canada highlighted by the significant acquisition of its competitor meta in 2020 which increased the number of stores from 37 to 67. the strategy shift that made everything change around the same time with higher margin profiles a pivotal decision for the company . from acquiring several brands in the u.s. such as smoke cartel fabcbd daily high club dankstop and nuleaf holdings to later acquiring blessedcbd in the uk high tide leveraged its market power to enhance margins and diversify its revenue streams. in the summer of 2021 was accepted for listing on the nasdaq marking a significant milestone. later that year a transformative decision was made high tide launched a discount club model for its retail stores in october 2021 . with consolidated margins higher than any competitor due to the previously mentioned cbd related acquisitions high tide could offer cannabis at remarkably low prices attracting loyal members and rapidly gaining market share . although this discount model initially involved selling cannabis at a loss the move proved to be incredibly successful . high tide s market share increased from less than 4 to over 10 in less than three years despite representing less than 5 of the total cannabis retail store count. today the discount model program has more than 1.5m members and continues to grow each quarter . being the first of its kind discount model was the key differentiating factor that propelled high tide to become the leading cannabis retailer in canada. no competitor could match their prices and raj targeted cannabis users who consumed regularly and were highly price sensitive. when i first started investing in high tide one of its closest competitors was fire flower holdings which ultimately went bankrupt following this price war. there are many more examples of competitors that went bankrupt following this showing how strong has become in the sector. and the consolidation of the market in canada is just starting. this strategy also significantly diminished the illicit market further strengthening high tide s market share. after capturing market share it was time to turn profitable while raj sacrificed margins to achieve this economies of scale and several initiatives aimed at improving margins allowed as well as positive net income in the most recent quarterly results with a consolidated leadership position stronger than ever. overall high tide took a calculated risk to become the leader in the country and it proved to be incredibly successful. this success was only possible due to the ceo s extensive experience in the sector and deep understanding of the cannabis consumer surpassing that of any other management team. what s next for the best is yet to come. while the focus on becoming fcf led to a notable deceleration in revenue growth is now returning to its high growth strategy . despite cannabis being legal for over five years there s still significant market potential to capture in canada. a recent regulatory change in ontario now allows one company to operate up to 150 recreational cannabis stores doubling the previous cap of 75. this change is benefiting large retail chains like capitalizing on the opportunity and targeting the high presence of the illicit market in the region. moreover the canadian market is experiencing significant consolidation allowing high tide to expand its market share organically and through acquisitions at depressed multiples. for example high tide recently acquired a store for 1.5x last quarter s annualized adj. ebitda. the ceo mentioned in the last earnings call that he s in negotiations with a sizable player to acquire additional stores aiming to accelerate its footprint expansion and surpass this year s initial target. every month there are dozens of cannabis stores closing in canada because they simply can t compete with over the next two years high tide is expected to reach a 15 market share up from 10.9 today. it s worth mentioning that raj and his team have always been methodical in selecting store locations ensuring each one yields significant returns which is why the annual revenue per store at surpasses the industry average by a wide margin. over the next three to five years there s potential to reach an annual revenue of $1b in canada alone . is one of the very few cannabis companies that does not depend on any new legislation to keep growing and improving its bottom line numbers. ongoing developments in the u.s. might give the green light to expand there. significant changes are on the horizon for the u.s. cannabis sector. the potential rescheduling of cannabis from schedule i to schedule iii could open doors for u.s. cannabis companies to list on major exchanges like nasdaq or nyse making it easier for institutional investors to get involved. the only reason high tide hasn t entered the u.s. market yet is to avoid compromising its nasdaq listing so this would finally open doors for the canadian leader. note for those who don t know u.s. cannabis companies can t be listed on the nyse or nasdaq only on the otc markets. since there s no issue. this is also one of the reasons why institutional ownership in the sector is so low. high tide with its vast e commerce base of over 3m u.s. customers and profitable operations is poised to leverage these developments. raj grover s strategic approach as a second mover allows him to avoid pitfalls and strategically open stores in key states. the company is ready to capitalize on its strong foundation and scale efficiently aiming to secure significant market share with well chosen locations and a clear expansion strategy. most u.s. operators struggle to turn a profit even with gross margins in the 40 50 range while is both fcf and net income profitable with a gross margin below 30 . while the company doesn t depend on the u.s. market to continue growing this presents an additional catalyst for its upcoming growth trajectory. regardless of whether this expansion happens quickly or not these developments will attract a wave of new investors to the sector and contribute to an overall expansion in multiples. high tide is becoming the costco of cannabis after the success of its free discount model which gathered over 1.5m members in under three years launched elite a paid membership with even better offers . the rollout began slowly but membership is now growing at a record pace 226 yoy and 38 qoq last quarter. it s worth noting that this growth is happening while the subscription price is being raised. although the absolute number is still relatively small at 46 000 the conversion rate of regular club members to elite ones is getting better every quarter. you only need to make a small purchase for the membership price to pay for itself it s exactly like the long term vision is for high tide to be the of cannabis driving strong and predictable cash flows and strengthening high tide s competitive edge . i believe this is one of the catalysts that will help further improve bottom line margins. despite being a retailer with relatively low margins have room to grow . cannabis prices in canada are just starting to stabilize and is waiting for full market stabilization before aggressively launching white labels. while many independents are closing and the market is consolidating isn t raising prices yet to avoid aiding competitors. the long term strategy is to leverage pricing power gradually . when i asked the ceo if fcf margins are nearing a peak the response was clear no there are still many growth opportunities . as the market consolidates and market share increases they anticipate further improvements in both gross and fcf margins plus new areas to explore with scale and other initiatives. valuation is the most superior cannabis business yet the cheapest. retail investors in canada alone have lost over $130b since the 2017 bubble popped so i understand why everyone is wary of this sector. but i have demonstrated how is different from the most well known cannabis companies like and others. high tide generates strong fcf and has a track record of consistently impressive execution . most importantly it has a highly aligned management team that cares about shareholders which is rare in the sector. the fact that this sector is at its peak of pessimism is what makes it possible for us to buy at such a cheap valuation. it s also worth mentioning that unlike the other names mentioned high tide went public late in the game and was not part of the bubble in 2017 2018. that s why it is so underfollowed and why most people don t even know about it.let s check the numbers. generated cad $22.7m in fcf over the last 12 months so it is currently trading at 10x ltm fcf. it s worth noting that this was the first full year of fcf profitability so this number should improve further from here. but since most cannabis companies are not fcf positive let s use ev ebitda as a proxy. is trading at 5x its ntm adj. ebitda while the average for is 7 8x. importantly its adj. ebitda from these last 12 months increased 82.7 from the previous year. it s mind blowing that it can trade at such a low multiple. the disparity is even larger when we look at other nasdaq listed cannabis stocks. for instance is trading at almost 20x at the same and isn t even ebitda positive. is the best performing cannabis company and one of the very few that is already generating both fcf and net income yet it remains the cheapest . faster growth better margins a superior management team a winning business model the lowest valuation a complete bargain at least in my view. while most investors are avoiding this sector due to the well known companies that destroy shareholder value i m taking advantage of this opportunity by investing in what i consider a hidden gem. the recent acquisition of nova cannabis by at a low valuation multiple might have highlighted how undervalued is. nova cannabis was one of the few competitors to high tide but under ownership it has lost direction. this acquisition occurred at an ev ttm revenue multiple of 0.55 0.6 while a more established and superior business was trading at 0.4x. similarly ev ttm gross profit multiple of 1.4x contrasts sharply with nova s 2.4x. this disparity indicates that is undervalued and the market is beginning to recognize this. 2nd following the news that the dea has scheduled a hearing on the marijuana rescheduling proposal after the u.s. election causing the entire cannabis sector to drop significantly performance remained strong. despite the sector wide double digit decline has maintained a notably higher value compared to its pre news levels. this resilience suggests that is too cheap to ignore and the market is catching on. before finishing i d like to highlight this has less than 10 institutional ownership while over 75 of the market is owned by institutions. peter lynch often talks about this . if you want to achieve multibagger returns find a hidden gem before the institutions do. $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti

2024-09-06,2024-09-06 17:18:42,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,sen. elizabeth warren writes a letter backing the doj investigation into nvidia antitrust allegations sen. elizabeth warren writes a letter backing the doj investigation into nvidia antitrust allegations [TITLE_END] september 5 2024 dear assistant attorney general kanter. competition is key to a thriving u.s. economy and faster economic growth. this is particularly true in the semiconductor market which will drive future advances in artificial intelligence and other tech breakthroughs the reason congress provided $52.7 billion in support for the industry in the chips and science act. this is why i welcome the reports that the department of justice has opened an antitrust investigation into nvidia whose blockbuster growth has made it one of the world s largest companies. while this growth has been primarily driven by the recent ai boom it has been supercharged by nvidia s use of anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation. i am pleased that the doj has joined authorities in other countries such as the united kingdom and the european union in investigating nvidia s conduct. until recently nvidia was a relatively niche provider of gaming chips but as a prime beneficiary of the al frenzy it has seen its market capitalization increase by 250 between november 2021 and may 2024. the money involved is vast and big tech is spending most of it microsoft and meta spent a combined $9 billion on nvidia s chips last year alone. amazon purchased as many as 50 000 chips in 2023. and google plans to pour nearly $40 billion into ai this year much of it on nvidia s products and services. as a result of this spending nvidia now controls an estimated 90 of the market for high end ai chips and 98 of the lucrative and growing data center graphics processing units market. its hardware has been the underpinning of almost every ai milestone including the development and deployment of openal s chatgpt 4 and other models. market power like that means the company decides who gets chips from its limited supply and how much they pay with some experts theorizing that nvidia has been making a 1000 profit through the retail price of some of its chips. this has effectively made nvidia the gatekeeper for the world s ai future. but in carrying out this responsibility nvidia has shown that it is not committed to fair play. the company locks customers in by bundling products software and services a practice that has already triggered antitrust scrutiny in france resulting in nvidia s own programming software being the only system that is fully compatible with its chips. in a move that was ultimately blocked by the federal trade commission nvidia has attempted to further raise barriers to entry by acquiring arm limited the developer of essential chip architecture. if the deal had gone through experts say nvidia would have gained control over a software architecture that most of the industry relies on. as nvidia cements its dominance venture funders are investing less in companies attempting to build competing chips. indeed the number of u.s. venture funding deals for al chips fell approximately 80 between 2022 and 2023. the insatiable hunger of gargantuan big tech companies for nvidia chips along with the company s opaque and preferential allocation of them are starving startup companies of the infrastructure they need to do business and crowding academic ai researchers out of the field. allowing a single company so much influence over ai research development and monetization poses dire economic risks. competition powers a virtuous cycle of rapid innovation by impelling each market participant to create the best products. it creates jobs and generates tax revenue. it reduces the need for regulation by giving the market a role in keeping aspiring monopolists in check. it reduces costs for companies by giving them a choice of suppliers. without the intervention of u.s. regulators the prospects of restoring competition in the semiconductor market are bleak. they will only grow bleaker as nvidia approaches 100 ownership of the market and as it begins pouring money into lobbying alongside the conventional big tech players to shape the contours of ai regulation and lock in its advantage. i thank you for your leadership and support efforts to undertake a comprehensive and fair investigation into nvidia. sincerely elizabeth warren united states senator,sen. elizabeth warren writes letter backing doj investigation nvidia antitrust

[TITLE_END] uber announced friday it is expanding its partnership with alphabet s waymo to offer robotaxi rides in austin texas and atlanta beginning in early 2025. shares of uber jumped 5 on the news while alphabet rose about 1 . uber riders in those cities can be matched with a driverless waymo car for some trips according to the companies. the rides will only be available through uber s app unlike in san francisco and los angeles where riders book through the waymo app. a waymo spokesperson said it had no plans to partner with uber in san francisco and los angeles. the expansion comes as uber faces investor pressure to step up its autonomous vehicle strategy especially ahead of tesla s planned robotaxi event slated for oct. 10. shares of uber have fallen 9 since the tesla event was announced and are off 17 from their 52 week highs. it may also slow waymo encroachment into uber s market share. an analysis from bernstein estimated that as of may 2024 waymo s 50 000 weekly paid rides made up approximately 2 of ride sharing usage in san francisco. since then waymo has doubled its paid robotaxi trips to 100 000 a week the company announced. we re thrilled to build on our successful partnership with waymo which has already powered fully autonomous trips for tens of thousands of riders in phoenix uber ceo dara khosrowshahi said in a release. uber s initial agreement with waymo in phoenix also included autonomous uber eats deliveries in the city. the expansion into austin and atlanta won t include uber eats at first according to the waymo spokesperson but they re exploring that possibility for the future. waymo co ceo tekedra mawakana said we ve been delighted at the positive feedback from our waymo one riders to date and we can t wait to bring the comfort convenience and safety of the waymo driver to these cities in partnership with uber. the expansion into two more cities is another step in uber s advancement into the robotaxi space after struggling to get a foothold and selling off its own self driving division in 2020 now relying on partnerships with companies including waymo gm s cruise and the softbank backed u.k. startup wayve to gain ground. uber shares dipped in august after the company announced a multiyear partnership with cruise to offer autonomous rides through its app next year. wells fargo analyst ken gawrelski cited cruise s previous safety challenges as a part of the investor skepticism along with now fulfilled hopes for a partnership with waymo instead. waymo has rapidly made strides in the self driving race. it currently offers robotaxi services to the public in san francisco los angeles and phoenix. it has logged more than 22 million miles through june of this year and last week it released a report that argued its vehicles are safer than human drivers. it began testing driverless cars on bay area freeways with google employees in august. some analysts were more hopeful for a potential uber and waymo expansion into san francisco. but atlanta and austin where waymo has already begun testing may still help sentiment. source,uber waymo offer driverless ride sharing trips austin atlanta uber waymo

2024-09-14,2024-09-14 11:36:31,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",pennystocks,research and detailed analysis on high tide inc $hiti research and detailed analysis on high tide inc $hiti [TITLE_END] background how became the leading cannabis retailer in canada the beginning raj grover the founder and ceo who owns 9 of the company and has never sold a single share comes from an entrepreneurial family and had already experienced success with several smaller businesses before establishing during a business trip to india in search of opportunities in fashion accessories or body jewelry raj stumbled upon the potential of cannabis consumption accessories. recognizing the margin arbitrage opportunity he shipped $10 000 worth of consumption accessories from new delhi to canada and sold everything overnight. after replicating this success a few more times raj decided to open a store. this marked the beginning of high tide s story . in 2009 raj opened smokers corner with an initial investment of less than $50 000 and grew it into a multimillion dollar empire. at that time there were only two or three competitors with unappealing stores. raj believed that by creating a differentiated store in a smart location he could easily capture market share and he was right. by leveraging his established roots in indonesia thailand china and india he was able to not only provide a better customer experience but also offer much cheaper products. cannabis legalization in canada always looking to stay ahead raj seized the opportunity when the prime minister of canada announced that recreational cannabis would soon be legalized. with an existing customer base of cannabis users it made perfect sense for raj to expand into selling cannabis itself. he realized that if he only sold accessories he would eventually lose customers to shops that offered both cannabis and accessories. after nine years of focusing on consumption accessories and accumulating nearly $10m in retained earnings raj raised $88.5m for the first time in 2018 and ventured into the equity markets marking the beginning of high tide s journey as a publicly traded company . with easier access to capital when compared to its peers high tide expanded its footprint across canada highlighted by the significant acquisition of its competitor meta in 2020 which increased the number of stores from 37 to 67. the strategy shift that made everything change around the same time with higher margin profiles a pivotal decision for the company . from acquiring several brands in the u.s. such as smoke cartel fabcbd daily high club dankstop and nuleaf holdings to later acquiring blessedcbd in the uk high tide leveraged its market power to enhance margins and diversify its revenue streams. in the summer of 2021 was accepted for listing on the nasdaq marking a significant milestone. later that year a transformative decision was made high tide launched a discount club model for its retail stores in october 2021 . with consolidated margins higher than any competitor due to the previously mentioned cbd related acquisitions high tide could offer cannabis at remarkably low prices attracting loyal members and rapidly gaining market share . although this discount model initially involved selling cannabis at a loss the move proved to be incredibly successful . high tide s market share increased from less than 4 to over 10 in less than three years despite representing less than 5 of the total cannabis retail store count. today the discount model program has more than 1.5m members and continues to grow each quarter . being the first of its kind discount model was the key differentiating factor that propelled high tide to become the leading cannabis retailer in canada. no competitor could match their prices and raj targeted cannabis users who consumed regularly and were highly price sensitive. when i first started investing in high tide one of its closest competitors was fire flower holdings which ultimately went bankrupt following this price war. there are many more examples of competitors that went bankrupt following this showing how strong has become in the sector. and the consolidation of the market in canada is just starting. this strategy also significantly diminished the illicit market further strengthening high tide s market share. after capturing market share it was time to turn profitable while raj sacrificed margins to achieve this economies of scale and several initiatives aimed at improving margins allowed as well as positive net income in the most recent quarterly results with a consolidated leadership position stronger than ever. overall high tide took a calculated risk to become the leader in the country and it proved to be incredibly successful. this success was only possible due to the ceo s extensive experience in the sector and deep understanding of the cannabis consumer surpassing that of any other management team. what s next for the best is yet to come. while the focus on becoming fcf led to a notable deceleration in revenue growth is now returning to its high growth strategy . despite cannabis being legal for over five years there s still significant market potential to capture in canada. a recent regulatory change in ontario now allows one company to operate up to 150 recreational cannabis stores doubling the previous cap of 75. this change is benefiting large retail chains like capitalizing on the opportunity and targeting the high presence of the illicit market in the region. moreover the canadian market is experiencing significant consolidation allowing high tide to expand its market share organically and through acquisitions at depressed multiples. for example high tide recently acquired a store for 1.5x last quarter s annualized adj. ebitda. the ceo mentioned in the last earnings call that he s in negotiations with a sizable player to acquire additional stores aiming to accelerate its footprint expansion and surpass this year s initial target. every month there are dozens of cannabis stores closing in canada because they simply can t compete with over the next two years high tide is expected to reach a 15 market share up from 10.9 today. it s worth mentioning that raj and his team have always been methodical in selecting store locations ensuring each one yields significant returns which is why the annual revenue per store at surpasses the industry average by a wide margin. over the next three to five years there s potential to reach an annual revenue of $1b in canada alone . is one of the very few cannabis companies that does not depend on any new legislation to keep growing and improving its bottom line numbers. ongoing developments in the u.s. might give the green light to expand there. significant changes are on the horizon for the u.s. cannabis sector. the potential rescheduling of cannabis from schedule i to schedule iii could open doors for u.s. cannabis companies to list on major exchanges like nasdaq or nyse making it easier for institutional investors to get involved. the only reason high tide hasn t entered the u.s. market yet is to avoid compromising its nasdaq listing so this would finally open doors for the canadian leader. note for those who don t know u.s. cannabis companies can t be listed on the nyse or nasdaq only on the otc markets. since there s no issue. this is also one of the reasons why institutional ownership in the sector is so low. high tide with its vast e commerce base of over 3m u.s. customers and profitable operations is poised to leverage these developments. raj grover s strategic approach as a second mover allows him to avoid pitfalls and strategically open stores in key states. the company is ready to capitalize on its strong foundation and scale efficiently aiming to secure significant market share with well chosen locations and a clear expansion strategy. most u.s. operators struggle to turn a profit even with gross margins in the 40 50 range while is both fcf and net income profitable with a gross margin below 30 . while the company doesn t depend on the u.s. market to continue growing this presents an additional catalyst for its upcoming growth trajectory. regardless of whether this expansion happens quickly or not these developments will attract a wave of new investors to the sector and contribute to an overall expansion in multiples. high tide is becoming the costco of cannabis after the success of its free discount model which gathered over 1.5m members in under three years launched elite a paid membership with even better offers . the rollout began slowly but membership is now growing at a record pace 226 yoy and 38 qoq last quarter. it s worth noting that this growth is happening while the subscription price is being raised. although the absolute number is still relatively small at 46 000 the conversion rate of regular club members to elite ones is getting better every quarter. you only need to make a small purchase for the membership price to pay for itself it s exactly like the long term vision is for high tide to be the of cannabis driving strong and predictable cash flows and strengthening high tide s competitive edge . i believe this is one of the catalysts that will help further improve bottom line margins. despite being a retailer with relatively low margins have room to grow . cannabis prices in canada are just starting to stabilize and is waiting for full market stabilization before aggressively launching white labels. while many independents are closing and the market is consolidating isn t raising prices yet to avoid aiding competitors. the long term strategy is to leverage pricing power gradually . when i asked the ceo if fcf margins are nearing a peak the response was clear no there are still many growth opportunities . as the market consolidates and market share increases they anticipate further improvements in both gross and fcf margins plus new areas to explore with scale and other initiatives. valuation is the most superior cannabis business yet the cheapest. retail investors in canada alone have lost over $130b since the 2017 bubble popped so i understand why everyone is wary of this sector. but i have demonstrated how is different from the most well known cannabis companies like and others. high tide generates strong fcf and has a track record of consistently impressive execution . most importantly it has a highly aligned management team that cares about shareholders which is rare in the sector. the fact that this sector is at its peak of pessimism is what makes it possible for us to buy at such a cheap valuation. it s also worth mentioning that unlike the other names mentioned high tide went public late in the game and was not part of the bubble in 2017 2018. that s why it is so underfollowed and why most people don t even know about it.let s check the numbers. generated cad $22.7m in fcf over the last 12 months so it is currently trading at 10x ltm fcf. it s worth noting that this was the first full year of fcf profitability so this number should improve further from here. but since most cannabis companies are not fcf positive let s use ev ebitda as a proxy. is trading at 5x its ntm adj. ebitda while the average for is 7 8x. importantly its adj. ebitda from these last 12 months increased 82.7 from the previous year. it s mind blowing that it can trade at such a low multiple. the disparity is even larger when we look at other nasdaq listed cannabis stocks. for instance is trading at almost 20x at the same and isn t even ebitda positive. is the best performing cannabis company and one of the very few that is already generating both fcf and net income yet it remains the cheapest . faster growth better margins a superior management team a winning business model the lowest valuation a complete bargain at least in my view. while most investors are avoiding this sector due to the well known companies that destroy shareholder value i m taking advantage of this opportunity by investing in what i consider a hidden gem. the recent acquisition of nova cannabis by at a low valuation multiple might have highlighted how undervalued is. nova cannabis was one of the few competitors to high tide but under ownership it has lost direction. this acquisition occurred at an ev ttm revenue multiple of 0.55 0.6 while a more established and superior business was trading at 0.4x. similarly ev ttm gross profit multiple of 1.4x contrasts sharply with nova s 2.4x. this disparity indicates that is undervalued and the market is beginning to recognize this. 2nd following the news that the dea has scheduled a hearing on the marijuana rescheduling proposal after the u.s. election causing the entire cannabis sector to drop significantly performance remained strong. despite the sector wide double digit decline has maintained a notably higher value compared to its pre news levels. this resilience suggests that is too cheap to ignore and the market is catching on. before finishing i d like to highlight this has less than 10 institutional ownership while over 75 of the market is owned by institutions. peter lynch often talks about this . if you want to achieve multibagger returns find a hidden gem before the institutions do. for greater understanding look at the company presentation since images are not

2024-09-25,2024-09-25 21:42:22,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,meta unveils $299 quest 3s vr headset orion ar glasses prototype meta unveils $299 quest 3s vr headset orion ar glasses prototype [TITLE_END] meta announced the quest 3s the latest virtual reality headset to come out of the company s reality labs division and a cheaper offering than its predecessor. the device will go on sale on oct. 15 and it ll retail starting at $299 down from the $499 starting price for 2023 s quest 3. the device can be used to watch movies as well as run vr fitness apps and gaming meta said wednesday at its connect event in menlo park california. the company positioned the headset as a multitasking computer putting it in competition with apple s $3 499 vision pro headset that launched in february. in addition to the quest 3s meta on wednesday also showcased its latest prototype of augmented reality smart glasses and announced a flurry of new features for its meta ai chatbot. meta s previous quest devices are the bestselling vr headsets with millions shipped thanks to heavy marketing and a lower price than many competitors but those efforts have yet to spark a cultural phenomenon or a mainstream software ecosystem around vr. including its acquisition of oculus in 2014 meta has poured more than $65 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts. meta ceo mark zuckerberg has defended the company s spending as a strategic initiative to prevent apple from controlling future hardware platforms. although there was hope among vr developers that apple s entry into the market would spur a wave of new apps and users apple hasn t revealed sales for its headset and reports suggest that sales have been in small volumes under 1 million units partially due to its high price. what it does a meta representative said the s in quest 3s stands for start as in getting started with vr. many of the new meta features that the company discussed for the $299 quest 3s have counterparts on apple s vision pro including a mode that allows for the device to be used on an airplane and another that simulates a large movie theater inside the headset. meta highlighted improved passthrough the term used to described when a vr headset uses cameras and sensors on the outside of the device to display live real time video inside the headset. that function is intended to make users feel like they are looking through a display and allows them to interact with the real world while keeping the headset on. for the quest 3s meta added a dedicated button to turn on passthrough. the company has emphasized the ability of the quest 3s to multitask and run apps positioning it as a computing device instead of a game console. all the things you can do with a general purpose computer quest is the full package zuckerberg said. in demos provided tuesday meta showcased the device running as many as four apps at one time on floating screens inside the headset including a youtube video a browser amazon music and meta s app store. meta says the headset can handle six windows. but the demo experience was not smooth. the amazon music app crashed window controls would disappear and meta s controllers would fall asleep after a few minutes if the user wasn t pressing buttons. besides the quest 3s meta also announced a price cut for last s year quest 3 bringing the price of the 512gb version down from $649 to $499. the quest 3 has more advanced lenses and a superior screen with a higher resolution than the quest 3s. additionally meta said it will discontinue the quest pro its $999 headset launched in 2022 that never gained much momentum and the older quest 2 headset. eventually glasses zuckerberg s justification for spending so much on vr and ar is his belief that the technology will eventually end up in lightweight transparent glasses that overlay computer graphics and information onto the real world. investing in vr software and hardware are early steps toward those glasses which could take as much as a decade to develop zuckerberg previously said. zuckerberg showed off an early concept of what those glasses could look like on wednesday. the thick black framed prototype called orion won t be sold to consumers but meta says they will be used internally as the company continues working toward the consumer glasses it hopes to one day sell. this is where we are going zuckerberg said. meta hopes the next version of orion will be available to consumers as the company s first full ar glasses zuckerberg said without giving a timetable for when that may be. orion is meta s first fully functioning prototype ar glasses zuckerberg said and the device is tethered wirelessly to a small puck. the prototype uses a wristband component to pick up on users neural signals and let them control the orion glasses using their brains. that technology stems from the company s 2019 acquisition of ctrl labs. orion enables users to play games multi task with multiple windows and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar zuckerberg said. meta s orion prototype comes a week after snap announced its fifth generation spectacles ar glasses. those thick framed glasses will only be made available to developers who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build ar apps for the device. this isn t the first time meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where vr and ar technology is headed. the orion glasses are an improvement on project nazare prototype smart glasses that zuckerberg announced in 2021 when the company changed its name from facebook. meta does sell a pair of glasses with a built in camera in partnership with essilorluxottica called ray ban meta which start at $299 and were announced in 2023. while these glasses don t have any displays they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with meta ai the company s voice assistant. as part of wednesday s event meta announced new meta ai features for its ray ban smart glasses. for example the ray ban meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in spanish and if asked can translate in the user s ear a new improvement meta said. the camera can scan qr codes and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes. another new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked. li chen miller the vice president of product in charge of ray ban meta glasses told cnbc that when she travels she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door and later she asks meta ai to recall the number. those features will become available later this year the company said. the ray ban meta smart glasses have sold more than 730 000 units in their first three quarters according to market researcher idc. in july zuckerberg told investors that they were a bigger hit sooner than expected. last week essilorluxottica and meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses. ai that speaks zuckerberg also introduced improvements to its meta ai chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice in addition to written prompts. with voice users will be able to have oral conversations with meta ai which is accessed through meta s apps. users will be able to perform actions using their voice such as telling meta ai to take a photo by talking to their smartphone. for meta ai s new feature the company is using computer generated voices from celebrities including awkwafina judi dench john cena keegan michael key and kristen bell. the new siri like meta ai voice feature will be available over the next month for u.s. canadian australian and new zealand users of whatsapp instagram facebook and messenger. the meta ai announcement comes a day after rival openai the maker of chatgpt announced an advanced voice feature for people who pay for its premium service. meta s new chatbot features are based on the company s ai model llama. meta on wednesday announced a newer version of llama called llama 3.2. this updated model can understand both images and text an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people s written prompts. source,meta

2024-09-26,2024-09-26 20:24:45,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",pennystocks,3 penny stocks that may bring you to the promised land stocksy s weekly dd 3 penny stocks that may bring you to the promised land stocksy s weekly dd [TITLE_END] hey everyone here are some notes from companies that i have been looking at this week. good lord kraken has been climbinggg. zomd and bolt both new mentions for me but they both look super solid. hope this can be of value to anyone. please feel free to comment any tickers you would like me to checkout cheers zomd technologies $zomd.v market cap 40m company overview zoomd technologies provides digital marketing solutions focused on user acquisition primarily in the mobile space. the company operates beyond the usual google and meta channels offering clients access to a range of media sources. this gives advertisers flexibility and allows them to diversify their marketing efforts all managed from one platform. highlights zoomd s q2 2024 results showed impressive growth with revenue jumping by 58 compared to the same quarter last year. they brought in $13.98m in q2 2024 up from $8.82m in q2 2023. what stands out most is their net profit of $2.15m a clear turnaround from the $785k loss they reported in the same period last year. this also makes it their fifth quarter in a row of profitability which shows that their recent efforts to refocus the business are working. cost control has been a big part of the story. they cut operating expenses by 21 which helped boost their adjusted ebitda to $3.03m nearly 700 higher than last year. the company s move to discontinue less profitable products and concentrate on core services has paid off. what caught my eye about zoomd is how they ve set themselves apart from the typical google and meta reliance. they give advertisers the flexibility to use a wider range of channels like sdk networks and programmatic ads which opens up more options and control for their clients. this is why i see a lot of room for zoomd to grow. as more advertisers look for ways to diversify and spread their marketing dollars beyond the big players zoomd is well positioned to benefit from that shift on the client side retention is solid. over 90 of their top customers have stuck around for more than three years which obviously shows that once companies start working with zoomd they see enough value to stay on board long term. kraken robotics inc. $krknf $png.v market cap 400m company overview kraken robotics is a canadian marine technology company specializing in advanced sonar and optical sensors subsea batteries and robotics for unmanned underwater vehicles. they serve both military and commercial sectors offering solutions that include high resolution imaging for defence offshore energy and subsea infrastructure monitoring. highlights kraken s q2 2024 results were impressive with revenue climbing 67 to $22.8m compared to $13.7m in q2 2023. the bulk of this growth came from product sales which jumped 83 thanks to continued demand for key offerings like their subsea batteries and katfish system. kraken ended q2 with $20.4m in cash boosted by a $20m equity financing and $45m in new credit facilities. this solid financial foundation supports kraken s ambitious growth plans including ramping up production and expanding into new markets with projected 2024 revenue of $90m $100m and ebitda of $18m $24m. kraken has been steadily building an impressive pipeline of contracts. they ve recently secured more than $8m in subsea battery orders along with an $8m acoustic corer project and a $3.7m katfish related order. these deals are part of a broader pipeline kraken estimates to be worth over $900m in identified opportunities. kraken has locked in some big multi year deals with major clients like nato navies and the canadian navy. their ability to keep key customers coming back including large players in offshore energy really shows how much trust there is in kraken s technology and the value they consistently deliver in both defence and commercial markets. kraken just seems like a solid bet at this point. some may find it a bit expensive but if they hit their projected revenue of 90m 100m that would be their fourth year in a row of nearly doubling their revenue. the company is just firing on all cylinders. bolt metals corp. $pcrcf $bolt.cn market cap 4m company overview bolt metals corp. is a canadian exploration company focused on securing and advancing key metals projects in north america. their portfolio is centred on critical metals like antimony and copper. highlights what i like about bolt is that they have some super promising projects that are largely unexplored despite strong historical results. the new britain antimony and gold project in british columbia for example spans over 2 400 hectares and has already shown high grade samples including 10.4 antimony 9.7 g t gold and 2 358 g t silver. these numbers are impressive but what s even more intriguing is that the site remains mostly untouched when it comes to modern exploration. for those of you who have no idea what antimony is don t worry i didn t either. but it turns out that this critical metal has been experiencing a supply crunch and the price has nearly doubled in 2024. china which controls the majority of the world s antimony production has tightened exports which has driven prices up dramatically. with barely any domestic companies exploring for antimony this only scarcity boosts bolt metals position. soap gulch is their other promising asset in bolt s portfolio with great potential for copper and zinc. historical drilling has already delivered copper grades as high as 4.7 along with solid results in zinc and gold. what makes this project even more exciting is the opportunity bolt has to leverage existing data. they ve got 5 000 meters of historical drill core that has never been sampled for copper. this is a huge advantage as they can analyze this core without having to launch an expensive new drilling program potentially saving them around cad $3.4 million. on top of that a 2018 airborne geophysics survey identified several untested anomalies which are essentially indicators of subsurface structures that might contain additional mineral deposits. these anomalies suggest that there could be even more copper and zinc hidden beneath the surface adding to the project s untapped potential. if bolt can confirm what the historical data hints at soap gulch could become a valuable copper play in a strong market. plus it looks like bolt metals is about to add another promising project to their portfolio with the silver switchback property. early surface sampling has shown impressive results with 1 975 g t silver 17.01 copper and 0.48 g t gold. the property has never been drilled but the existing permit is valid until 2027 making it drill ready too. management is excited about this one and sees it as a key part of their growth plan with a solid exploration program in the works to uncover more silver and copper. it could definitely be a strong addition to their portfolio. all of this while still maintaining a strong cap structure. bolt has a tight share structure with only 8.9m shares fully diluted and 42 insider ownership. if you made it this far thanks for reading keep in mind that none of this is financial advice and i highly suggest doing your own research before chucking your hard earned money into a stock you saw through a random dude on reddit. $zomd $krknf $png $pcrcf $bolt,3 penny stocks bring promised land stocksy s

the fsd technology alone. with just two weeks to go for tesla inc. s tsla robotaxi unveil event an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company s self driving technology. what happened tesla s fsd which is now promoted as fully supervised fsd is a safety disaster and galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition said glj research s gordon johnson in a note. tesla s competitors in this arena are alphabet inc. s googl goog waymo and general motors corp. s gm cruise. with tesla eyeing the rollout of its fully supervised fsd in china the elon musk led company would be up against domestic player baidu inc. s bidu apollo go. johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. independent lab amci testing which tried the technology said the overall performance of tesla s camera enabled autonomous driving software is suspect. in a report released on tuesday the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. in fact our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation an average of once every 13 miles it said. while the fsd 12.5.1 was impressive it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with fsd to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels it said. the most critical moments of fsd miscalculation are split second events that even professional drivers operating with a test mindset must focus on catching it added. johnson also referred to data from which aggregates tsla fsd driving experiences data in real time from users which shows that the latest iteration of fsd has a critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city. data reported by competitors to the california department of motor vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows waymo 17 311 miles amazon inc. s amzn zoox 177 602 miles 17 077 miles weride 21 191 miles the metric for tesla is 13 miles based on amci s statistics johnson said although tesla doesn t yet report data to california dmv given its fsd tech is only level 2. why it s important johnson noted that many sell side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for tesla s fsd technology. in real time the value is close to zero he said adding that it could be negative given the liability of putting something this dangerous on roads. according to ark s valuation model by 2029 robotaxis which has fsd as its core technology would account for 63 of tesla s revenue and 86 of ebitda. future fund llc managing partner gary black a tesla bull said in a

2024-09-30,2024-09-30 21:54:40,TSLA,Tesla,pennystocks,the race for u.s. lithium independence in the ev revolution the race for u.s. lithium independence in the ev revolution [TITLE_END] lithium demand is projected to quadruple by 2030 driven by the electric vehicle boom and increasing global energy storage needs. li ft power has strengthened its lithium portfolio through key projects in canada including its recent acquisition of 9 681 hectares in the little nahanni pegmatite district. with a price target of $9.25 cad and a potential upside of 240 li ft power offers a strong investment opportunity in the growing lithium market. the electric vehicle boom led by companies like tesla nio and stellantis has brought global attention to lithium a vital resource for the ev industry. governments and corporations are racing to secure it for future energy needs. despite having its own lithium reserves the united states currently produces only 1 of the global supply making it heavily dependent on foreign sources especially china. to safeguard its energy future and reduce reliance on geopolitical rivals the u.s. must ramp up domestic lithium production significantly. lithium abundance vs. production concentration though lithium is widely distributed across the globe its production is dominated by a handful of countries. australia chile china and argentina produce over 95 of the world s lithium. however the united states holds significant untapped reserves particularly in nevada north carolina and california. these states are estimated to contain about 4 of the world s lithium deposits making the u.s. home to some of the largest reserves outside the lithium triangle in south america. despite this u.s. production remains limited compared to global leaders. as the electric vehicle industry accelerates lithium demand is projected to surge. benchmark mineral intelligence forecasts that by 2030 annual lithium demand will hit 2.4 million tons four times the expected production for 2024. to support this growing need the inflation reduction act introduces $370 billion in incentives for domestic ev and battery production aiming to reduce reliance on imports. additionally earlier in 2023 the department of energy committed $3 billion to boost the u.s. ev supply chain following the bipartisan infrastructure law s passage which further emphasizes localizing production and bolstering the clean energy industry. this initiative is going to coordinate the effort across the federal government and work closely with the private sector labor unions tribes community organizations and our partners and allies abroad it s going to secure america s electric vehicle battery supply chain and clean energy future president joe biden china s strategic control over the lithium supply chain china s dominance over the global lithium supply chain is a result of strategic investments and policies aimed at controlling critical minerals. according to a 2021 white house report between 2009 and 2019 china funneled $100 billion in subsidies rebates and tax exemptions to its companies and consumers to capture the lithium refining market before demand skyrocketed. this gave china a powerful position as both the largest consumer of unrefined lithium and the leading producer of refined lithium. china has employed anti competitive tactics such as subsidizing production even when demand was low and dumping products at below market prices to outcompete international players. chinese companies have also invested heavily in lithium mines around the world ensuring their access to the supply. this strategy mirrors china s actions in controlling other critical minerals like cobalt graphite and nickel further entrenching its global mineral dominance. america must reduce its reliance on china and other adversaries for critical minerals our nation s dependence on foreign sources for these materials creates a serious threat to our national and economic security senator gary peters my stock pick li ft power for america s independency the reason why i am mentioning li ft power is because the company focuses on acquiring exploring and developing high potential lithium pegmatite projects in canada. its flagship asset the yellowknife lithium project in the northwest territories is key covering a large portion of the yellowknife pegmatite province known for significant lithium pegmatite formations. along with this li ft holds three promising early stage exploration properties in quebec and is advancing the cali project in the little nahanni pegmatite group further strengthening its position in the lithium market. on september 3 2024 li ft power announced a significant expansion of its operational area in the little nahanni pegmatite district located in the northwest territories canada. the company acquired an additional 9 681 hectares at its cali project which includes outcropping spodumene pegmatites a crucial lithium bearing mineral linked to the broader cali dyke swarm that the company has been actively mapping. this expansion was made possible following the n ts hch oh amendments to the saht land use plan in june 2024 which provided new opportunities for staking claims in the region. these amendments were expected after receiving endorsement from the saht secretariat incorporated and the government of the northwest territories back in 2019. as of september 20 2024 li ft power s stock is trading at $2.72 cad with a market capitalization of $107.24 million cad. in terms of future projections analysts have set a 12 month price target of $9.25 cad representing a potential upside of 240.07 with estimates ranging from a low of $8.50 cad to a high of $10.00 cad. the company s share structure includes 42.7 million outstanding shares and an additional 1.07 million options for a fully diluted total of 43.8 million shares. ownership remains concentrated with 55 held by founders 17 by institutional investors 25 by retail investors and 3 by management and directors. top institutional shareholders include commodity capital ag extract capital and tribeca investment partners. conclusion lithium is becoming an increasingly vital resource as the demand for electric vehicles surges yet production remains concentrated in a few countries like australia chile china and argentina. while the u.s. holds significant untapped reserves production has not kept pace with global leaders. to address this the inflation reduction act and bipartisan infrastructure law provide substantial funding to boost domestic lithium production and reduce reliance on china which dominates the lithium refining market. companies like li ft power are poised to benefit from these trends with their strategic lithium projects in canada. recent expansions in the northwest territories position li ft to capitalize on rising demand. with analysts projecting a 240 stock price increase li ft offers strong growth

2024-10-01,2024-10-01 17:23:05,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,the crash of the stock market has arrived. price earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire s p 500. the crash of the stock market has arrived. price earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire s p 500. [TITLE_END] almost 90 days ago i made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why i believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. i have included that entire post below and all of these reasons still remain relevant... moreso than ever with the news from the middle east today. obviously the port strike is expediting things today. nonetheless i think the post is super relevant and for some reason the moderators of wsb deleted the post after 6 hours despite it receiving over 2.2 million views and over 1100 shares. the ride the market has been on quite simply has been insane. according to generally accepted wisdom by investing in the s p 500 you can anticipate to double your money on average every 6.5 years. i m not 100 certain as to why that s the accepted figure as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64 . below is a chart of the average price rate of return of gspc over the last 14 cycles.. i couldn t easily find data prior to this.. year gspc price 6.5 year return on investment 1933.5 10.91 1940 12.05 10.44 1946.5 18.43 52.95 1953 26.38 43.13 1959.5 58.68 122 1966 92.88 58 1972.5 107.14 15 1979 99.93 7.22 1985.5 191.85 91.90 1992 408.78 113 1998.5 1133.84 177 2005 1181.27 4.10 2011.5 1320.64 11.70 2018 2471.65 87.10 2024.5 5525.29 123 while the last two cycles don t necessarily ring any alarm bells we have just more than doubled twice looking at the last two cycles there is one massive bloated shit filled elephant in the room... price to earnings ratio. historically the price to earnings ratio for the s p has sat just under 20 . the median value has it under 18x and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at 10x. currently the p e ratio sits at 28.71 roughly 150 of what is normal. in the history of the s p the p e ratio has hit this level only 3 times... immediately preceding and then during the dot com bubble . immediately preceding and then during the global financial crisis . the quarter after covid hit. . images aren t allowed in this subreddit but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday 09 30 at a p e of 30.07 historically what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark in all three scenarios by the time we crossed a p e of 30 the dam had already started to break. during the dot com bubble the s p 500 was already down 19 from its highs and would fall another 34 before finally starting to recover. by the the time the bleeding stopped it had lost 47 of its value. during the global financial crisis an almost identical story can be told. the s p had lost 18 of its value by time p e broke 30 and when it finally bottomed out in february of 2009 it lost 53 of its total value. covid obviously was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32 and had bounced back in less than 6 months time . okay so maybe we have a price to earnings ratio problem but you re still not sold. what else do we have going on outside of the fact that i firmly believe that the market is overvalued today i think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment and while i could write a diatribe for each for purposes of succinctness i ll simply outline them via bullet points below. credit card debt is at an all time high and outside of a brief period after covid checks arrived has been rising since 2013. younger americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. as boomers continue to retire it will be the working class most disproportionately affected. credit card delinquency rates are the highest they ve been since 2011. auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they ve been at any point in history. auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they ve been since 2010. the stock market is insanely top heavy right now. the magnificent 7 amazon apple meta microsoft nvidia and tesla now account for 45 of the entire value of the nasdaq. they account for roughly 30 of the entire stock market combined. as of today they are trading at a combined p e of 42x. a correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole. we are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. furthermore i do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. i think many of the jobs added over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences. many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. while this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst some of the largest banks including bank of america charles schwab and usaa have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50 of their equity capital. regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of us treasury notes they hold that were bought during covid. in short nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. banks flush with cash took said money and bought us t notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. this was at a time when interest rates were very low. now that interest rates are high demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. if any sort of bank run starts these banks will be forced to liquidate said t bills and they will have to sell them at a loss. if too many people do this simultaneously the bank will become insolvent like what we saw happen with silicon valley bank signature bank and first republic bank. . the us government still has a spending problem. our deficit has grown by $500 million since i started writing this an hour ago. global tensions are high and rising. massive protests are erupting all over europe. the us is involved in two proxy wars that don t appear as if they will abate any time soon. the political division in the us is as dramatic as i ve seen it at any point in my existence. perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here but it seems most are resorting to tribal identity politics split down party lines. commercial real estate is starting to buckle. covid brought about work from home and with many offices retaining those practices or allowing partial work from home office space supply far outpaces demand. this problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. when that balloon is bout to come due the owner of that property will refinance the loan restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020 during covid when rates bottomed out are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. however with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago and vacancy rates skyrocketing many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. commercial real estate foreclosures jumped 117 in march alone. housing has become increasingly less affordable for many americans. for 2022 the most recent year i could find data a family earning the median us household income renting a median priced us home was spending 40 of their income on rent. countries are abandoning the us dollar in droves. i believe some of these issues on their own are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. bundled together i don t see how we aren t in for a very rude awakening. this economic downturn may be severe. in the three times this has happened before the action or lake thereof varied dramatically. during scenario one the dot com bubble the government largely just let the companies fail. while i was only 11 at the time my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies unlike scenario two. during the gfc shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the us financial system. while i won t get into partisan politics i m of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary and more importantly for this post the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic. bailouts on any level whether to companies banks or directly to citizens will inevitably increase inflation. i don t think they are on the table for this correction. people have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... and while supply chain issues didn t help i think the bigger issue by far was the sheer amount of money we printed. you cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn t going to suddenly become worth less money. we just lived through this reality after the covid printing. this will largely tie the feds hands. print more money we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates. what happens from here i don t know. don t listen to me. i m an idiot. stock market will probably just continue to go up. i m probably wrong about 100 of this. the prediction in bold below is what i posted 90 days ago. i now believe the top is officially in that we won t see another ath for a long

1959.5 58.68 122 1966 92.88 58 1972.5 107.14 15 1979 99.93 7.22 1985.5 191.85 91.90 1992 408.78 113 1998.5 1133.84 177 2005 1181.27 4.10 2011.5 1320.64 11.70 2018 2471.65 87.10 2024.5 5525.29 123 while the last two cycles don t necessarily ring any alarm bells we have just more than doubled twice looking at the last two cycles there is one massive bloated shit filled elephant in the room... price to earnings ratio. historically the price to earnings ratio for the s p has sat just under 20 . the median value has it under 18x and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at 10x. currently the p e ratio sits at 28.71 roughly 150 of what is normal. in the history of the s p the p e ratio has hit this level only 3 times... immediately preceding and then during the dot com bubble . immediately preceding and then during the global financial crisis . the quarter after covid hit. . images aren t allowed in this subreddit but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday 09 30 at a p e of 30.07 historically what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark in all three scenarios by the time we crossed a p e of 30 the dam had already started to break. during the dot com bubble the s p 500 was already down 19 from its highs and would fall another 34 before finally starting to recover. by the the time the bleeding stopped it had lost 47 of its value. during the global financial crisis an almost identical story can be told. the s p had lost 18 of its value by time p e broke 30 and when it finally bottomed out in february of 2009 it lost 53 of its total value. covid obviously was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32 and had bounced back in less than 6 months time . okay so maybe we have a price to earnings ratio problem but you re still not sold. what else do we have going on outside of the fact that i firmly believe that the market is overvalued today i think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment and while i could write a diatribe for each for purposes of succinctness i ll simply outline them via bullet points below. credit card debt is at an all time high and outside of a brief period after covid checks arrived has been rising since 2013. younger americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. as boomers continue to retire it will be the working class most disproportionately affected. credit card delinquency rates are the highest they ve been since 2011. auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they ve been at any point in history. auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they ve been since 2010. the stock market is insanely top heavy right now. the magnificent 7 amazon apple meta microsoft nvidia and tesla now account for 45 of the entire value of the nasdaq. they account for roughly 30 of the entire stock market combined. as of today they are trading at a combined p e of 42x. a correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole. we are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. furthermore i do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. i think many of the jobs added over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences. many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. while this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst some of the largest banks including bank of america charles schwab and usaa have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50 of their equity capital. regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of us treasury notes they hold that were bought during covid. in short nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. banks flush with cash took said money and bought us t notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. this was at a time when interest rates were very low. now that interest rates are high demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. if any sort of bank run starts these banks will be forced to liquidate said t bills and they will have to sell them at a loss. if too many people do this simultaneously the bank will become insolvent like what we saw happen with silicon valley bank signature bank and first republic bank. . the us government still has a spending problem. our deficit has grown by $500 million since i started writing this an hour ago. global tensions are high and rising. massive protests are erupting all over europe. the us is involved in two proxy wars that don t appear as if they will abate any time soon. the political division in the us is as dramatic as i ve seen it at any point in my existence. perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here but it seems most are resorting to tribal identity politics split down party lines. commercial real estate is starting to buckle. covid brought about work from home and with many offices retaining those practices or allowing partial work from home office space supply far outpaces demand. this problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. when that balloon is bout to come due the owner of that property will refinance the loan restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020 during covid when rates bottomed out are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. however with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago and vacancy rates skyrocketing many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. commercial real estate foreclosures jumped 117 in march alone. housing has become increasingly less affordable for many americans. for 2022 the most recent year i could find data a family earning the median us household income renting a median priced us home was spending 40 of their income on rent. countries are abandoning the us dollar in droves. i believe some of these issues on their own are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. bundled together i don t see how we aren t in for a very rude awakening. this economic downturn may be severe. in the three times this has happened before the action or lake thereof varied dramatically. during scenario one the dot com bubble the government largely just let the companies fail. while i was only 11 at the time my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies unlike scenario two. during the gfc shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the us financial system. while i won t get into partisan politics i m of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary and more importantly for this post the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic. bailouts on any level whether to companies banks or directly to citizens will inevitably increase inflation. i don t think they are on the table for this correction. people have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... and while supply chain issues didn t help i think the bigger issue by far was the sheer amount of money we printed. you cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn t going to suddenly become worth less money. we just lived through this reality after the covid printing. this will largely tie the feds hands. print more money we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates. what happens from here i don t know. don t listen to me. i m an idiot. stock market will probably just continue to go up. i m probably wrong about 100 of this. the prediction in bold below is what i posted 90 days ago. i now believe the top is officially in that we won t see another ath for a long

2024-10-02,2024-10-02 15:10:06,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,tesla stock slips after it reports 462 890 total deliveries during the third quarter tesla stock slips after it reports 462 890 total deliveries during the third quarter [TITLE_END] tesla posted its third quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on wednesday. the stock fell about 2 in premarket trading after the report. here are the key numbers total deliveries q3 2024 462 890 total production q3 2024 469 796 analysts were expecting deliveries of 463 310 in the period ending sept. 30 according to estimates compiled by factset streetaccount. deliveries are not defined in tesla s financial disclosures but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. it s one of the most closely watched metrics on wall street. in the year ago period tesla reported 435 059 deliveries and production of 430 488 evs. last quarter the company reported 443 956 deliveries and production of 410 831 vehicles. tesla is facing increased competitive pressure especially in china from companies like byd and geely along with a new generation of automakers including li auto and nio. in the u.s. ev competitors like rivian are maturing while legacy automakers ford and general motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification. gm this week reported a roughly 60 increase in ev sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. still its electric business is tiny compared to tesla s with just 32 100 units sold in the latest period accounting for 4.9 of the company s total sales. ford plans to report results on wednesday. tesla hasn t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle the angular stainless steel cybertruck to their lineup. the company also said on wednesday that it deployed 6.9 gwh of energy storage products in the quarter. shares of tesla climbed 32 in the third quarter erasing their loss for the year in the process. the stock is now up almost 4 in 2024 trailing the nasdaq which has gained 19 . tesla s brand has been under pressure in the u.s. due in part to the antics of ceo elon musk who in addition to endorsing former president donald trump has shared what the white house called racist hate and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on x his social media app. but tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the u.s. than any other automaker with hyundai a distant second. in its third quarter earnings report later this month investors will be particularly focused on profit margins. tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in china as well as in the u.s. prior to earnings tesla will host a marketing event on oct. 10 and is expected to show off the design of dedicated robotaxi. musk has promised tesla self driving cars for years but the company has yet to deliver. meanwhile competitors like waymo and pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services. source,tesla stock slips

to impress [TITLE_END] shares of electric vehicle maker tesla tumbled friday after the company s long awaited robotaxi event where ceo elon musk unveiled the firm s cybercab self driving concept car failed to impress investors. tesla stock was down 5.8 as of 6 33 a.m. et in premarket trading on friday. musk revealed tesla s cybercab concept vehicle a low silver two seater has no steering wheels or pedals on thursday night. the plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches. the tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the cybercab before 2027 but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. he said consumers would be able to buy a tesla cybercab for a price tag under $30 000. he also said he expects tesla to have unsupervised fsd up and running in texas and california next year in the company s model 3 and model y electric vehicles. fsd which stands for full self driving is tesla s premium driver assistance system available today in a supervised version for tesla electric vehicles. the technology still requires a human driver at the wheel ready to steer or brake at any time. in reaction to the thursday event analysts at barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near term opportunities for tesla instead prioritizing musk s vision for a fully autonomous driving future. as expected like prior tesla product unveils the event was light on the details and instead emphasized the vision underpinning tesla s growth endeavors in ai av barclays u.s. autos mobility team wrote in the note early on friday. yet there were no updates indicating near term opportunities. tesla didn t show its low cost model planned for 1h 25 production they added. we also didn t get any near term updates on fsd progress or data reflecting improvement in the system. piper sandler analysts said in a separate friday note that most trading oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo taxi unveiling. we wouldn t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks as pre event momentum fizzles the investment bank s analysts said in the note. morgan stanley meanwhile suggested that musk failed to make the case that tesla is an ai company during the event. the bank s analysts noted that musk didn t mention any details on improvements to tesla s fsd system nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie up between tesla and xai musk s ai company. musk has previously denied such reports. the event overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas a lack of data regarding rate of change on fsd tech ride share economics and go to market strategy morgan stanley s analysts wrote in a note friday. we were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. as such we anticipate tsla to be under pressure following the event they added. it is expected to take some years still before self driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles. among the few companies that have successfully launched self driving cars on public roads is google s waymo which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since june.,tesla shares drop 6 premarket cybercab robotaxi reveal fails impress tesla shares drop 6 premarket cybercab robotaxi reveal fails

[TITLE_END] seeing a lot of focus on the temu boston dynamics bot but not a lot of discussion on the robo taxi. how this thing is built tells me how out of touch and unprepared tesla is to seriously compete in ride servicing. first off this thing has two seats that alone is such a dumb design decision. it had to be elon that said to keep it as two seats so it looks futuristic and aesthetic. what if i want to travel with a small group of people i m not using the lax shuttle van at that point i m immediately turning to a competitor. haven t really seen anyone comment on how out of touch and unnecessary that was. one other concern i have is how tesla primarily uses cameras. what if there are sirens and a fire truck ambulance or police car is blowing through an intersection. other autonomous vehicles incorporate sound i m not too sure tesla does. if not it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. beyond this there s the ridiculous price tag he put on it which it ll probably be nowhere close to. what are other people s thoughts on this did anything with this robotaxi actually look like a feasible product to you it looks like an aesthetic toy but not an actual product that can compete in the space. based on my understanding of a typical car design cycle redesigning this to add four instead of just 2 seats would take probably another 2 4 years at least. to me it seems like they really just showed they lost on their biggest bet in the near future. edit alright read through the comments and still think the 2 seat no steering wheel design is stupid. people are saying this is meant to also be a personal commuter car. so my choices are to buy a 30k robotaxi and then also get a model 3 or model y to drive around my family for another 40k when i can just get one model 3 or any other self driving car no robotaxi and do everything i need how is that budget friendly at all and if there s a nicer car with a steering wheel that self drives why would i buy something without the option of a steering wheel still a toy. also if it s for personal use how does this know where to park at my office or how to get past a security gate to private property if i live in a condo building with a garage how does it know how to get out of the parking garage and where my parking space is it makes no sense as a personal car for a lot of people. and even if the majority of taxi rides are 1 2 people why not just use a model 3 that s 10k more already exists and can service that additional 15 20 of your taxi market . you also save on all the costs that it took to make a stupid 2 seater when it came to expanding production lines capacity testing and designing the pointless thing. my opinion doesn t change this thing shouldn t exist and it s out of touch with what most people need. total waste of time when they could ve focused on actually competing with growing competition in the normal car space where they re losing their competitive advantage. there s a reason why uber and the ex waymo ceo were not impressed.,tesla completely touch needs taxi services. tesla completely touch needs taxi services.

by percentages. i m looking for valuable input feedback and discussion around it. and if it happens to be helpful to anyone even better. i do want to clarify a few things i m focused on ai bitcoin and space. investment vehicles or not i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise are poised for massive growth and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let s just call this a frontier tech portfolio to give it a name i can reference. i m not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think ai is all hype or you are anti bitcoin and think it s a ponzi scheme or you think space is a waste of resources or anything along these lines that s ok i respect that perspective but i d like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things and you won t convince me i m simply wrong. i am looking for feedback on blind spots poor missing assumptions overconfidence things i m not considering or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i m not just looking for people to agree with me i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes i m missing some key areas of what many would call frontier tech biotech green nuclear energy cybersecurity to name a few but i just don t have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i m most confident and able to stay up to date. i m trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who s less familiar with one or any of the spaces categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting sexy but that i don t know enough about . i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and or admire. ok with that out of the way let s dive in 30 ai 10 nvda 5 soxq 15 balanced mixed of now msft aapl googl meta amzn high level to me this category is absolutely going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. ai s potential is not chatgpt or smarter versions of it. it s far beyond what we re seeing from llms today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the ai space listen to not what they believe is gonna happen but to what they know is coming because they ve already used the tech usually 1 2 years before the public even sees it these people are overwhelmed amazed terrified enchanted bewildered. to me that s just very interesting. i believe what some others do that we re in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i m not bothered much that ai isn t monetizing in demonstrable repeatable ways. i think there s been and continues to be enough fundamental increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks i ll do a quick dive here. to be clear i don t think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but seems useful to give my favorite things about each 10 nvda these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it s not just gpu blackwell demand. it s their cuda programming language and universe and stickiness of it. it s the long term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5 10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it s ceo jensen pushing them and already looking for the next big thing. just a lot of confidence here. 5 soxq i like this semiconductor etf a little more than smh because it s more diverse and it s got a low expense ratio . i love this exposure because the ai industry is driven by these companies . 15 mix of these... now excellent leadership and integrated heavily with nvda tech will benefit hugely from ai boom with ai driven automation meta founder run and with a clear vision demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building ai models meeting consumer needs being pioneers in tech at large aapl will probably benefit the most from consumer facing ai products and implementation strong

revolution with its investment in openai ai integration into azure and microsoft 365 excellent leadership googl ai pioneer with deepmind brain they still own search have enormous amount of data questionable leadership but i m holding for now no tsla no. i just don t trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company s leadership for me to invest in its stock. there s a big chance i m missing out but i m able to sleep ok with that. i m also missing plenty of other ai picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30 bitcoin 25 bitcoin itself 5 mstr high level why bitcoin books have been written about it but to shortly summarize my perspective it s quite volatile and risky short term and quite growth oriented and safe long term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology math code based and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that s only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days it s hard to justify not putting more into this one but for now i m convinced that diversification is the better long term play. 20 bitcoin many would argue that holding actual bitcoin ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for fbtc or ibit . i do some cold storage and some fbtc . either way just bitcoin. it s the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5 mstr this is a leveraged bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces btc growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some mstr profits to bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4 1 btc mstr ratio. 30 space 10 asts 10 rklb 5 lunr high level the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that s been talked about for decades and decades. for a while space x really proved this out almost single handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here s why 10 asts you should read the kook report for a true deep dive but to hit my high level points they are pre revenue but with the potential for massive growth. effectively their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5 years ahead of what many think will be a winner takes most race. their partners already include at t verizon vodafone rakuten american tower bell canada and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky ish play as they have tons to still accomplish but the potential growth is enormous. 10 rklb effectively a space x competitor on smaller rockets with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom defense and general research spending expands to space economy rklb is positioned very very well. 5 lunr i ve spent less time researching them than the other two but my confidence level in the risk reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential good amount of risks ahead. 10 cash ...to buy them juicy dips. ok that s my frontier tech portfolio summary. to repeat this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better than average returns over the next 10 years. i recognize that this discussion didn t even really touch share price eps p e profitability revenue or other key details. this just isn t the place where i m getting into that. i can say that i m comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding

2024-10-15,2024-10-15 19:01:21,TSLA,Tesla,investing,frontier tech portfolio frontier tech portfolio [TITLE_END] hey all sharing what i m calling my frontier tech portfolio broken down by percentages. i m looking for valuable input feedback and discussion around it. and if it happens to be helpful to anyone even better. i do want to clarify a few things i m focused on ai bitcoin and space. investment vehicles or not i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise are poised for massive growth and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let s just call this a frontier tech portfolio to give it a name i can reference. i m not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think ai is all hype or you are anti bitcoin and think it s a ponzi scheme or you think space is a waste of resources or anything along these lines that s ok i respect that perspective but i d like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things and you won t convince me i m simply wrong. i am looking for feedback on blind spots poor missing assumptions overconfidence things i m not considering or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i m not just looking for people to agree with me i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes i m missing some key areas of what many would call frontier tech biotech green nuclear energy cybersecurity to name a few but i just don t have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i m most confident and able to stay up to date. i m trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who s less familiar with one or any of the spaces categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting sexy but that i don t know enough about . i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and or admire. ok with that out of the way let s dive in 30 ai 10 nvda 5 soxq 15 balanced mixed of now msft aapl googl meta amzn high level to me this category is absolutely going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. ai s potential is not chatgpt or smarter versions of it. it s far beyond what we re seeing from llms today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the ai space listen to not what they believe is gonna happen but to what they know is coming because they ve already used the tech usually 1 2 years before the public even sees it these people are overwhelmed amazed terrified enchanted bewildered. to me that s just very interesting. i believe what some others do that we re in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i m not bothered much that ai isn t monetizing in demonstrable repeatable ways. i think there s been and continues to be enough fundamental increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks i ll do a quick dive here. to be clear i don t think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but seems useful to give my favorite things about each 10 nvda these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it s not just gpu blackwell demand. it s their cuda programming language and universe and stickiness of it. it s the long term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5 10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it s ceo jensen pushing them and already looking for the next big thing. just a lot of confidence here. 5 soxq i like this semiconductor etf a little more than smh because it s more diverse and it s got a low expense ratio . i love this exposure because the ai industry is driven by these companies . 15 mix of these... now excellent leadership and integrated heavily with nvda tech will benefit hugely from ai boom with ai driven automation meta founder run and with a clear vision demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building ai models meeting consumer needs being pioneers in tech at large aapl will probably benefit the most from consumer facing ai products and implementation strong

2024-10-18,2024-10-18 07:03:01,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,large cap tech nvidia and by extension us index funds are likely to crash small cap value international to outperform. here s why large cap tech nvidia and by extension us index funds are likely to crash small cap value international to outperform. here s why [TITLE_END] if you look at the story of how the s p500 has performed so well over the past decade the answer is high return on invested capital from tech companies. by hiring top engineers to build innovative products and scaling the product globally these companies to achieved rapid growth at little cost resulting in impressive returns to shareholders. historically hardware costs were very cheap to scale compared to the revenue it brings in. you could spend a few thousand per month in hosting costs and bring in millions in profits. however this is changing. 7 out of 10 of the top holdings in the s p500 are gambling huge on ai they have laid off tens of thousands of the talented engineers that drove their earnings growth in order to fund expensive acquisitions of ai hardware. tech can no longer be seen as an industry with low capital costs because ai is tremendously expensive to deploy and maintain. for example microsoft expects to spend $100 billion on ai datacenters through fiscal 2027. that s 40 more than their entire profit in 2023. because ai hardware is so expensive and the electricity usage is so tremendous these future applications are no longer cheap to deploy and maintain. chatgpt is perhaps the best example of this. despite being tremendously successful from a growth perspective it has been tremendously unprofitable from an operating standpoint and relies on continued bailouts from large companies like microsoft nvidia and softbank to stay afloat. the economics of tech companies is quickly changing with companies in an arms race to acquire as many nvidia chips as possible to build the best genai applications they are hurting their margins and operating profitability. the impact of these investments has been quite lousy so far other than some round tripping transactions to create fake revenue and balance sheet growth these ai investments while tremendously expensive have not paid off microsoft s copilot has been a complete failure consumers are not buying copilot pcs and the copilot app has a 2.3 star rating on the windows store. they are also facing regulatory pressure in europe over recall. google s ai is providing dangerous and potentially deadly misinformation to users of its search engine such as incorrect advice about prescriptions. amazon s go stores were supposed to use ml ai to handle checkouts when in reality the ai failed to handle most of the work and the remainder was just outsourced to human operators in india which struggled to keep up with the workload. tesla has still failed to implement full self driving and during its robotaxi event had human actors control the robots to fake them being ai controlled. google s waymo is very impressive from a technology standpoint but its hardware costs and regulatory barriers make it unlikely to achieve profitability even as it expands. despite the poor results of ai investments so far all of the top 10 holdings in the s p500 other than berkshire hathaway trade at very high p e ratio suggesting that very high earnings growth is priced in. even if ai will have a significant impact on the economy and society the economics of it are not favorable to investors due to the high capex costs involved. tech is no longer an industry where a team of 10 20 engineers can build a product that brings in billions in revenue with minimal hosting costs. it is now an industry where billions of capital expenditures are needed just to build a model and margins on the finished product are very poor. of course tech ceos realize this which is why microsoft openai and google are all working to replace nvidia hardware which sells at a huge markup with their own in house chips. this is a tremendous threat to nvidia s long term prospects. given the high expectations implied by elevated price to earnings ratios and the poor financial performance of ai applications it does seem quite unlikely that large caps will continue to outperform. small cap value and international stocks are almost certainly a better investment if ai does drive significant productivity improvements then labor heavy businesses will benefit from improved margins from using these products that large tech companies are offering. looking at small cap value funds like avuv and international stock indexes there are a tremendous amount of labor intensive businesses with low margins in these funds that would benefit from ai ml. net margins going from 3 to 10 due to improved productivity would mean earnings more than tripling. this has historically been the case with technical revolutions. for example railroads revolutionized our economy and drove tremendous economic growth but they provided terrible returns to shareholders.,large cap tech nvidia extension index funds likely crash small cap value international outperform. s large cap tech nvidia extension index funds likely crash small cap value international outperform. s [TITLE_END] look story s p500 performed past decade answer high return invested capital tech companies. hiring engineers build innovative products scaling product globally companies achieved rapid growth little cost resulting impressive returns shareholders. historically hardware costs cheap scale compared revenue brings in. spend thousand month hosting costs bring millions profits. changing. 7 10 holdings s p500 gambling huge ai laid tens thousands talented engineers drove earnings growth order fund expensive

tremendously unprofitable operating standpoint relies continued bailouts large companies like microsoft nvidia softbank stay afloat. economics tech companies quickly changing companies arms race acquire nvidia chips possible build best genai applications hurting margins operating profitability. impact investments quite lousy far round tripping transactions create fake revenue balance sheet

google s ai providing dangerous potentially deadly misinformation users search engine incorrect advice prescriptions. amazon s stores supposed use ml ai handle checkouts reality ai failed handle work remainder just outsourced human operators india struggled workload. tesla failed implement self driving robotaxi event human actors control robots fake ai controlled. google s waymo impressive technology standpoint hardware costs regulatory barriers make unlikely achieve profitability expands. despite poor results ai investments far 10 holdings s p500 berkshire hathaway trade high p e ratio suggesting high earnings growth priced in. ai significant impact economy society economics favorable investors high capex costs involved. tech longer industry team 10 20 engineers build product brings billions revenue minimal hosting costs. industry billions capital expenditures needed just build model margins finished product poor. course tech ceos realize microsoft openai google working replace nvidia hardware sells huge markup house chips. tremendous threat nvidia s long term prospects. given high expectations implied elevated price earnings ratios poor financial performance ai applications does quite unlikely large caps continue outperform. small cap value international stocks certainly better investment ai does drive significant productivity improvements labor heavy businesses benefit improved margins using products large tech companies offering. looking small cap value funds like avuv international stock indexes tremendous labor intensive businesses low margins funds benefit ai

2024-10-23,2024-10-23 14:35:32,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,alphabet to $7 trillion by 2025 alphabet to $7 trillion by 2025 [TITLE_END] we believe alphabet is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2 trillion figure now potentially becoming the world s most valuable company by a huge margin as its often overlooked waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. this would take the stock to over $500 a share. here s why. fact waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10 000 to over 100 000 in the last 12 months. it went from 50 000 weekly rides to 100 000 just in the last six months. the growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive case in point uber does more than 200 million rides each week. let s let that sink in. so if autonomous rides can capture even half that market that would mean 100 million rides per week. that s about 1 000 times where waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. at $30 per ride we re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year. but wait there is more to the growth story if waymo is already delivering over 100 000 driverless rides how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles the shift could be massive. for each person hailing a cab there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat streaming netflix while they re stuck behind the wheel. in fact early data backs this up. according to earnest analytics waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride hailing services like uber or lyft. people enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. safety could also be another attraction. waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85 reduction in injury causing crashes compared to national rates for human operated cars. investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride hailing market has substantial growth potential it could easily expand by 2 3x. a $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn t out of the question. this growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like tesla which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies. but wait aren t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving yes but not all of them are making the same progress. waymo has a head start in the market. its main competitor general motor s backed cruise lost its driverless permits in california after a serious accident making waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in san francisco. uber exited its self driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with waymo to bring its services to the uber app in some cities. while electric vehicle behemoth tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self driving space given its large base of vehicles it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its robotaxi vehicle earlier this month. waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. it uses a fleet equipped with high resolution cameras lidar and radar systems creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. and don t forget google s got a secret weapon. it crowdsources annotated data such as captcha codes from its massive user base using that to train its machine learning models. that s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments. the best part these are self driving cars no human drivers no unions no employee or contractor issues and no human cost. while there will be other expenses such as software development and battery costs the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. margins of 50 aren t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride hailing models. if waymo can capture about one third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. with a 50 margin that s a neat $150 billion in profits. what s that worth at a 30x earnings multiple that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for alphabet. considering that alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently this could take the company s market cap to over $6.5 trillion or over $500 per share. to be sure building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time quite different from signing up for say a google or netflix account. however investors will need to look well out into the future. think 2030 maybe even more. the point is not to get stuck if you re concerned look even further out say 2035 the bottom line alphabet is growing waymo quickly has the technology and competitive edge and is addressing a potentially massive market making this high valuation within reach. source alphabet to $7 trillion by 2025,alphabet $7 trillion 2025 alphabet $7 trillion 2025 [TITLE_END] believe alphabet positioned grow valuation 3x huge $2 trillion

[TITLE_END] tesla shares soared 22 to close at $260.48 on thursday the stock s best day since 2013 following the company s better than expected earnings report. the company late wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion which came in just under analysts expectations of $25.37 billion but was up 8 compared with a year earlier. tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents. we expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in tesla shares thursday given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company analysts at jpmorgan wrote in a note. tesla s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits which the jpmorgan analysts noted were a potentially unsustainable driver of earnings and cash flow. automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year and if they can t meet the target they can buy credits from other companies. tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles. tesla earnings also got a boost from fsd the company s full self driving supervised system. cfo vaibhav taneja said on the earnings call that fsd contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after tesla made it available for use in the cybertruck and added a feature called actually smart summon. ceo elon musk said on the call that his best guess is that vehicle growth will reach 20 to 30 next year citing lower cost vehicles and the advent of autonomy. analysts surveyed by factset were expecting delivery growth of about 15 for 2025. even bullish deutsche bank analysts doubted musk s forecast and wrote in a note following the earnings report our view remains more reserved at 10 15 and assumes tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its model y at a price under $30 000 after subsidies and other variants of the small suv. analysts at morgan stanley who also recommend buying the stock called musk s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a maybe. they set their estimate at 14 . it clearly depends on the company s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model introduction financing offers and improved features the morgan stanley analysts wrote in a note thursday. a grain of salt musk said on the wednesday call that tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled cybercab a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals by the end of 2026. he also said tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in california and texas next year in its existing cars which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time. bernstein analysts who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of tesla wrote in a note out thursday the tone of tesla s conference call was ebullient and filled with musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors and was more akin to a pep rally with the company only taking two questions from sell siders. musk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn teslas into robotaxis. that hasn t happened yet. musk has also promised a refreshed version of the tesla roadster since 2017. the design of the vehicle is not yet complete. the bernstein analysts wrote we continue to struggle to see tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis and believe fully unsupervised fsd could be years away. they pointed to musk s long history of being overly optimistic about fsd and said crowdsourced research that shows tesla continues to lag well behind competitors on robotaxis. the share rally thursday was the sharpest since a 24 gain in may 2013. the jump erased tesla s loss for the year and left the stock up 3 in 2024 though it still trails the 22 gain for the nasdaq. source,tesla stock best day decade musk s 2025 growth projection

capital expenditures surge 81 [TITLE_END] amazon ceo andy jassy is trying to reassure investors who may be worried about the future payoff of the company s massive investments in generative artificial intelligence. on a conference call with analysts following the company s third quarter earnings report on thursday jassy pointed to the success of amazon s cloud computing business amazon web services which has become a crucial profit engine despite the extreme costs associated with building data centers. i think we ve proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business jassy said. we expect the same thing will happen here with generative ai. amazon spent $22.6 billion on property and equipment during the quarter up 81 from the year before. jassy said amazon plans to spend $75 billion on capex in 2024 and expects an even higher number in 2025. the jump in spending is primarily being driven by generative ai investments jassy said. the company is rushing to invest in data centers networking gear and hardware to meet vast demand for the technology which has exploded in popularity since openai released its chatgpt assistant almost two years ago. it is a really unusually large maybe once in a lifetime type of opportunity jassy said. and i think our customers the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long term that we re aggressively pursuing it. ai spending was a big topic on tech earnings calls this week. meta on wednesday raised its capital expenditures guidance and ceo mark zuckerberg said he was quite happy with the team s execution. meanwhile microsoft s investment in openai weighed on its fiscal first quarter earnings released on wednesday and the company said capital spending would continue to rise. a day earlier alphabet cfo anat ashkenazi warned the company expects capital spending to grow in 2025. amazon has said its cloud unit has picked up more business from companies that need infrastructure to deploy generative ai models. it s also launched several ai products for enterprises third party sellers on its marketplace and advertisers in recent months. the company is expected to announce a souped up version of its alexa voice assistant that incorporates generative ai something jassy said will arrive in the near future. amazon hasn t disclosed its revenue from generative ai but jassy said thursday it s become a multi billion dollar revenue run rate business within aws that continues to grow at a triple digit year over year percentage. it s growing more than three times faster at this stage of its evolution as aws itself grew and we felt like aws grew pretty quickly he added. source,amazon ceo pledges ai investments pay

company. still just waiting on these glm drill results and i just like zomd s growth prospects. hope this dd can be of value to anyone. please feel free to recommend any tickers you would like me to check out cheers mccoy global $mccrf $mcb.to market cap 99m company overview mccoy global develops equipment and technology for the energy and industrial sectors especially oil and gas. their lineup includes tools like hydraulic power tongs and digital solutions like smarthub and virtual thread rep which are designed to streamline operations and bring data insights to drilling sites. highlights mccoy s last quarter was pretty solid. they pulled in $19.9m in revenue up 23 from last year . earnings had a major boost too. net income shot up by 119 landing at $3.1m compared to $1.4m last year. one big reason mccoy s doing well is their fms tool. this tool makes the process of handling pipes a lot easier and safer. instead of needing extra manual tools the fms has replaceable parts that grip and release pipes quickly which means fewer crew members are needed on the job. this setup saves both time and money for operators which is why field crews are starting to rely on it especially in tough conditions where efficiency and safety are key. simply put the fms is solving real problems and that s why it s boosting mccoy s sales. mccoy s growth is also coming from a big push into international markets especially in the eastern hemisphere. they used to be focused mainly on north america but now around 60 of their revenue is coming from overseas. this matters because it makes them less dependent on any one region. their tools like the fms are catching on with companies abroad who are focused on efficiency. by spreading their business across more markets they set themselves up with a more reliable revenue stream even if one area slows down. also they got $9 million in cash and no debt giving them the flexibility to keep growing without needing outside financing zoomd technologies ltd. $zmdtf $zomd.v market cap 52m company overview zoomd operates in the digital ad tech space specializing in mobile focused kpi driven advertising solutions. their tech helps brands navigate advertising channels outside major platforms like google and meta providing a unified service for customer acquisition across various media types. zoomd s platform allows clients to efficiently manage and optimize ad campaigns on multiple channels from social media to programmatic ad networks all while maintaining clear kpi based results. highlights zoomd brought in $22.7 million in revenue in the first half of 2024 up 30 from last year. by focusing in on their core high performing products they ve made a strong turnaround with net income hitting $2.1 million in q2 2024 compared to previous losses. they cut operating expenses by 21 which helped drive adjusted ebitda to $3.03m nearly 700 higher than last year. this shift toward core services and discontinuing less profitable products is clearly doing well for them. zoomd s approach is a big plus for brands aiming to grow internationally. their platform makes reaching audiences across regions like north america and europe easier by offering a range of media options so brands aren t limited by regional ad restrictions. this flexibility gives companies the reach they need to effectively connect with global markets. another strength for zoomd is their client retention. their top 10 clients have stayed with them for over three years on average which speaks to strong client satisfaction and effective campaign management. with this high retention and a diverse client base zoomd is building a steady stream of recurring revenue as they continue to expand globally. golden lake exploration $golxf $glm.cn market cap 6m company overview golden lake exploration is a junior mining company focused on the jewel ridge property in nevada s battle mountain eureka gold trend a prolific gold producing area. highlights jewel ridge is in a great location within the battle mountain eureka trend an area that has produced over 40 million ounces of gold historically. this site is surrounded by major projects like i 80 gold s ruby hill which has over 7.73 million ounces of gold and mcewen mining s gold bar project. historical drilling at jewel ridge has shown promising results. notable intercepts include 56.39 meters of 1.24 g t gold and 10.67 meters of 4.79 g t gold. the eureka tunnel target is another highlight yielding 3.23 meters of 57.16 g t gold 452.03 g t silver 7.23 lead and 11.99 zinc . this intercept resulted in eric sprott building a position in the company as one of the top shareholders. i m mentioning glm in this post because they just recently started drilling and have some very promising targets. one of the key areas is magnet ridge which spans an 800 meter long anomaly in a well known gold corridor. this anomaly was identified through geophysical surveys and shows a strong chargeability response hinting at the potential for sulphide minerals which are associated with precious metals. i m expecting these drill results to be released in the next few weeks. earlier drilling nearby hit 5.13 g t gold over 5.43 meters near the surface. now they re going deeper into the core of the anomaly where the chargeability is 10x stronger making it a much more interesting target. with promising geology and high priority drill spots this setup looks pretty solid. i just think there is a decent chance for some good finds and the current risk to reward isn t bad at all considering if they hit anything like they did in the past it could run hard in this market. plus that is only the target i am most optimistic about they have some other solid ones as well. thank you

2024-11-05,2024-11-05 15:05:41,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,musk now says it s pointless to build a $25 000 tesla for human drivers musk now says it s pointless to build a $25 000 tesla for human drivers [TITLE_END] so will there be any new car model for tesla in 2025 x200b musk now says it s pointless to build a $25 000 tesla for human drivers x200b when reuters reported in april that tesla had scrapped plans for a long promised next generation $25 000 electric vehicle the automaker s stock plunged. chief executive elon musk rushed to respond on x his social media network. reuters is lying he posted without elaborating. tesla s stock recovered some of its losses. six months later musk appears to have backed into an admission that tesla dropped its plans for a human driven $25 000 car. he said in an oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable ev would be pointless unless the car was fully autonomous. his latest remarks came in response to an investor asking when can we expect tesla to give us the $25 000 non robotaxi regular car model musk responded we re not making a non robo before he was interrupted by another tesla executive. musk later added basically i think having a regular $25k model is pointless. it would be silly. the april 5 reuters article reported that tesla had abandoned plans for an all new affordable mass market ev but still planned a self driving robotaxi. since then musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles. tesla and musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story. on the october earnings call musk said that tesla does plan a $25k car its cybercab a two door two seat fully autonomous vehicle. musk unveiled a prototype at a hollywood style event on oct. 10. musk says tesla will start production of the cybercab in 2026 after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current model 3 and model y vehicles in texas and california next year. the automaker faces steep technological regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on musk s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles which echo others dating back about a decade. an all new affordable tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of tesla s strategy to become the world s biggest automaker. for several years tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030 more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of toyota the current global sales leader. in may tesla dropped the 20 million goal from its latest impact report on progress toward sustainability goals. as recently as january of this year musk confirmed the plan for an all new affordable ev in an earnings call. he said the next generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major growth wave following the first wave with the release of its model 3 and model y vehicles in 2017 and 2020 respectively. investors and tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a model 2 slotting in below the model 3 currently the least expensive tesla starting at $42 490. in january musk described the all new model as requiring new revolutionary manufacturing technology. but in april after reuters reported tesla had scrapped the model 2 musk outlined a plan for more affordable models that could be produced on the same manufacturing lines as current teslas. seth goldstein a morningstar research services analyst said he believes these less expensive vehicles will be built on current tesla platforms and priced in the mid $30 000s. it was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more affordable vehicle on a new platform he told reuters. i think tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their chinese ev peers so they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle. after the april 5 reuters report that tesla had killed the model 2 musk posted that day on x saying tesla planned a robotaxi unveil in august. the event delayed until october and held on a movie set near los angeles underwhelmed wall street and drove a 9 drop in tesla shares the following day. some investors viewed musk s comments on the cybercab along with displays of an autonomous robovan concept and humanoid robots as short on concrete details about the products. tesla hasn t said whether the cybercab will feature new self driving technology beyond the company s full self driving feature in its current vehicles. its existing models can t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention. the target market for the cybercab isn t clear. the cybercab s sports car looks and two door two seat configuration a nearly extinct layout in the wider u.s. auto market puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage. musk in the october earnings call said the concept vehicle s design was optimized for autonomy and would also deliver affordability. it will cost roughly 25k so it is a 25k car musk said. it just won t have a steering wheel and pedals.,musk says s pointless build $25 000 tesla human drivers musk says s pointless build $25 000 tesla human

due to this news. members of president elect donald trump s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self driving vehicles one of the transportation department s priorities according to people familiar with the matter. if new rules enable cars without human controls that would directly benefit elon musk the tesla inc. chief executive officer and trump mega donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president elect s inner circle. he has bet the future of the ev maker on self driving technology and artificial intelligence. current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities which tesla plans to do. the trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self driving vehicles according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they weren t authorized to speak publicly. while the transportation department through the national highway traffic safety administration can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles an act of congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self driving cars. a bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around avs two of the people said. one candidate under consideration for transportation secretary is emil michael a former uber technologies inc. executive who has spoken with trump s team and potential staffers they said. the work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined they said. republican representatives sam graves of missouri and garret graves of louisiana have also been considered to lead the department the people said. the transition team didn t respond to requests for comment. musk in october announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. current us regulations pose significant hurdles to musk s plans for the so called cybercab including a cap limiting their deployment. he supported federal rules for autonomy on tesla s third quarter earnings call saying he d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. the pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of uber and rival lyft inc. trump has since named musk and entrepreneur vivek ramaswamy to lead a new department of government efficiency initiative to dismantle government bureaucracy and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome. past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled. nhtsa currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2 500 self driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100 000 have repeatedly failed. a bill to do that sailed through the house several years ago during trump s first term but the measure has been bogged down in the senate. an attempt during the first year of the biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class action cases.,trump team seeking ease rules self driving cars trump team seeking ease rules self

2024-11-19,2024-11-19 21:04:07,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power multiples and enterprise value palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power multiples and enterprise value [TITLE_END] hello friends. i hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. this is a long analysis with a position at the end. i will discuss palantir and its recent explosion in share price as well as their current earnings multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. i recognize that this is r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone s risk profile. i hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir. so here s something you may have read somewhere palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy . since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. i m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o business segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. they showed strong revenue growth increasing margins and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. it is obviously a company that for the right price you want to be a part of. key phrase for the right price . i am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. but i would like to make a case for palantir being overvalued. in fact the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated palantir s stock is. for starters let s take into consideration palantir s enterprise value. despite the stock price rising roughly 50 versus its 2021 peak palantir s enterprise value has ballooned much more. 2021 peak enterprise value $60b at around $37 per share 17 11 2024 enterprise value $146b at around $64 per share this is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. in december 2020 palantir had 978m shares outstanding. this has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. while palantirs growth has certainly been impressive it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. their revenue per share metrics have been the following. end of 2020 $1.12 2021 $0.80 2022 $0.92 2 023 $1.04 ltm $1.19 palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue per share number that it had by the end of 2020. this is not necessarily a bad thing but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived growth stock. yes revenue is increasing but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. as a shareholder your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth. likewise their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. if it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture you better believe karp co will do so. many of palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non gaap numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag but one of the most overlooked aspects i found is that of interest income. palantir has a massive cash balance that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. this is of course nothing new lots of companies do this. but consider this. in their last blowout quarter palantir gained $0.06 of gaap eps. this amounts to roughly $150m of net income or about 1 1000th of their enterprise value. of this number $52m or more than one third was interest income. this is not a small footnote. only $100m of their last quarterly earnings was actual non adjusted no nonsense operating income. furthermore they also paid only $7.8m of taxes on their income. this number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. and then there is the valuation. palantir trades at 55x ev sales. this means that if all of palantir s revenue was after tax profits and paid out as dividends it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. their current ebit margin is a little over 13 . that 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require a incredible and sustained growth in revenue b a steadily increasing margin and c an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time we all remember stock mcnealy s iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble at 10 times revenues to give you a 10 year payback i have to pay you 100 of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. that assumes i can get that by my shareholders. that assumes i have zero cost of goods sold which is very hard for a computer company. that assumes zero expenses which is really hard with 39 000 employees. that assumes i pay no taxes which is very hard. and that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal. and that assumes with zero r d for the next 10 years i can maintain the current revenue run rate. now having done that would any of you like to buy my stock at $64 do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are you don t need any transparency. you don t need any footnotes. what were you thinking this is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. remember you still need upside it s not just about justifying the current stock price it s about penciling out enough upside in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. on friday the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. tesla bitcoin and palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. palantir added 11 and with this move added another five years of revenue to its elephant sized market cap. this shows pretty clearly that palantir is associated with meme like risk assets. who knows when the current market cap will reverse. it s a game of liquidity. musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. but one thing is clear their current ev ebitda is nearly 400x . the amount of retail shareholders i see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. my question is why based on what sure it shoots up 5 a day and this leads everyone to believe it s an amazing company. but long term this company has enormous shoes to fill. it is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. and unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40 annually for a decade and increase their margins to nvidia levels there is only one way this ride will end. as it stands now all of palantir s equity is in the $5b cash position that they gained through dilution. last quarter the company earned $0.06 of gaap eps of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. aside from the $2 of equity per share all of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. in the future growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1 3rd of gaap eps in interest income. their taxes will also go up in the future. if this is not a dotcom level valuation i do not know what is. if you currently buy a 10 year bond you will net roughly 4.5 in interest annually. palantirs stock nets you 1 8 in revenue all of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. thus i am short for now using graniteshares 3x palantir . the leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. thus i will look to acquire long dated puts this week. could get smoked some more but that s what makes a market. happy investing,palantir short thesis analysis current earnings power multiples enterprise

billion in pc chip sales by 2029 as company gets traction beyond smartphones [TITLE_END] qualcomm said on tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029. of that amount roughly $4 billion will come from pc chips qualcomm said at its investor day on tuesday. the chipmaker just introduced pc processors earlier this year when it released snapdragon x for windows devices. the latest forecast marks an important milestone for qualcomm ceo cristiano amon who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. in fiscal 2024 qualcomm s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales about 75 of its entire chip business. qualcomm also said on tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175 by 2029 to $8 billion of which 80 is tied to contracts that have already been secured. we have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile amon said at the investor event. another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets a category qualcomm calls xr. about $4 billion of the forecast is a catch all for other chip sales like those for wireless headphones and tablets. qualcomm shares are up 16 this year trailing the nasdaq which has gained 26 . qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high end smartphones especially those running google android. qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to apple for its iphones. but the company has warned investors that apple could choose to stop buying qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. qualcomm said on tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from apple. qualcomm s strategy under amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips like modems processors and ai accelerators in new markets including cars pcs and virtual reality. the investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion. we put a strategy in 21 and we re not changing our strategy amon said. laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by intel which has over 70 percent of the market according to mercury research. intel reported $29 billion in pc chip sales in its 2023. the competitive landscape changed between the windows and macs amon said referring to apple s move in 2020 to switch from intel to its own processors. we saw that as an opportunity especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution. the forecast for xr headsets also hints at the growth potential of the vr market over the next five years. qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers including meta for its quest and ray bans products. when it comes to artificial intelligence qualcomm calls itself an edge ai company in contrast to cloud based ai that s typically powered by nvidia processors. company officials didn t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with cnbc. qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced ai that s restricted to large server farms today an indication that that company may benefit from the ai boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient. what you can run on the cloud last year you can run on the

2024-11-27,2024-11-27 11:20:49,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,deep dive into kering from timber to gucci a legacy of acquisitions deep dive into kering from timber to gucci a legacy of acquisitions [TITLE_END] 1.0 introduction let s start with a fun fact. kering the company that owns brands like gucci yves saint laurent balenciaga bottega veneta and alexander mcqueen started as a timber trading company . although it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry its dna and management style haven t changed much. as i m writing this its share price is down over 70 from its peak back in august 2021 that was elevated due to the covid 19 pandemic. 2.0 the journey from timber to luxury 2.1 the timber period the company was founded in france by fran ois pinault back in 1962 with a 100 000 francs loan from the bank. the business grew rapidly by acquiring many failing local timber traders in france especially in the 1980s. by 1988 it owned 180 companies and 33 factories. 2.2 the switch from timber to retail to luxury in 1988 it was listed on the paris stock exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started it merged with cfao acquired conforama acquired printemps acquired 54 of la redoute acquired finac the transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42 of gucci group 100 of boucheron and 100 of yves saint laurent. today gucci accounts for 47 of its revenue. fran ois henri pinault the son of the founder fran ois pinault became general manager of the company in 2003 and ceo in 2005. under his leadership the acquisitions in the luxury space continued. it is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions . its portfolio is quite diversified and includes high end clothing footwear handbags and leather goods sunglasses and eyewear scarves other fashion accessories jewelry fragrances cosmetics watches it is also geographically diversified apac 32 of revenue western europe 28 of revenue north america 23 of revenue japan 8 of revenue rest of the world 9 of revenue 3.0 historical financial performance its revenue increased from 15.9 billion in 2019 to 20.4 billion in 2022 and has contracted back to 18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. kering s gross margin is stable at 75 meaning the direct costs are well controlled. however its operating margin is down below 20 . the explanation is simple. reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job. when there s less traffic in the physical stores the operating expenses remain the same. the company still needs to pay the lease payment its employees the utility bills etc. in fact these expenses grow over time as there s the impact of inflation. scaling down by closing locations is also not a free option. not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location. the company is generating substantial cash flows but i ll argue the capital allocation is poor. all numbers in m cash 1.837 operating cash flow 21.541 capex acquisitions debt 4.887 share buyback dividends other 25 cash 3.696 between 2019 and h1 2024 the company generated over 21.5 billion in operating cash flow or a bit less than 14 billion after capex. close to 60 of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends and an additional 15 through share buybacks. what s left of the free cash flow together with additional debt was used for acquisitions. why do i think the capital allocation is poor two main reasons 1. almost 80 of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022 the years when the share price was the highest . a good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares. 2. its net debt position more than doubled from 7.1 billion in 2019 to 15.4 billion as of june 30th 2024. this is equal to 60 of its market cap. the interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75 to 5 and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate it could significantly reduce its profit margins. 4.0 what can be expected based on the latest investor presentation there are three capital allocation priorities organic growth shareholder return and fuel high potential adjacent businesses. all of it while having a healthy financial situation and fcf generation. this is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. i find this slide a bit odd for three reasons 1. on one side they want to return capital to the shareholders which would position them as a company with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends . on the other side its history is full of acquisitions which is the opposite of preserving capital. 2. the center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and fcf generation while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years . 3. innovation is not a focus at all. roughly 2 months ago essilorluxottica and meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. i see a lot of potential in this area that isn t utilized . growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the dna of the company and likely what one should expect going forward. 5.0 dividends the dividend per share has been steadily increasing from 4 back in 2015 to 14 in 2024. the current dividend yield is 6 . if the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option. 6.0 high employee turnover at the end of 2023 the company had 48 964 employees. during the year there were 13 403 new hires and 11 275 employees departed. at first glance this is no doubt a high turnover. this sounds bad at first but it is really difficult to decipher. in theory any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees during peak seasons. therefore the increase and subsequently decrease of employees is normal. this is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive . in addition 59 of the employees are gen y a generation that is known for seeking career growth which could lead to more job hopping than average. given the reviews on indeed glassdoor and comparably there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue. 7.0 the concerns 7.1 balenciaga advertising scandal back in 2022 balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. one of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage inspired outfits. this was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate. this brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing. in addition given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands scandals of this kind could have a significant impact. 7.2 preliminary investigation by the european commission in april 2023 the european commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. one of the inspections took place at the italian premises of gucci. an investigation of this kind does not imply guilt but if a company is found in breach of eu antitrust rules there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros. the investigation is still ongoing and no conclusions have been reached. 8.0 valuation this is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. therefore here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing kering revenue the industry is cyclical in nature so there will be good and bad times. based on the past i do not feel confident that kering can take market share so i expect its growth to normalize at 3 per year which is in line with the inflation rate. operating margin the luxury market is getting more crowded and as argued earlier reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. once the demand is somewhat stable i expect the operating margin to increase to 21 . based on those assumptions the fair value of the company is 27 billion which is very close to the current price of 224 share . this offers an irr of 9 which is slightly below the historical return of the s p500. 8.1 the bull case those who are betting on kering are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following revitalization of balenciaga rebuilding its reputation after the controversies sustained growth in gucci and expansion of secondary brands like bottega veneta saint laurent the success of its newly launched beauty division capturing market share from rivals like lvmh and estee lauder positive macro tailwinds utilizing pricing power integration of recent acquisitions reducing operating costs if the management can pull this off then the value per share could be 2x from today s share price. 8.2 the bear case those who are betting against kering are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following brand mismanagement more scandals inability to revitalize balenciaga inability to innovate around its primary brands failure to integrate its acquisitions further poor m a acquisitions negative macro tailwinds inability to innovate around e commerce supply chain issues competitive pressure increase in corporate tax by the french authorities in this scenario the fair value per share could be below 100 share. i hope you enjoyed this post feel free to share your thoughts.,deep dive kering timber gucci legacy acquisitions deep dive kering timber gucci legacy acquisitions [TITLE_END]

commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into microsoft including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses a source familiar with the matter said on wednesday. the probe was approved by ftc chair lina khan ahead of her likely departure in january. the election of donald trump as u.s. president and the expectation he will appoint a fellow republican with a softer approach toward business leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air. the ftc is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its azure cloud service to other competitive platforms sources confirmed earlier this month. the ftc is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products the source said on wednesday. microsoft declined to comment on wednesday. the ftc fielded complaints about microsoft last

earlier on wednesday. until now microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to u.s. antitrust regulators recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at big tech companies. facebook owner meta platforms apple and amazon.com inc. have all been accused by the u.s. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies. alphabet s google is facing two lawsuits including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines. microsoft ceo satya nadella testified at google s trial saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence. it is unclear whether trump will ease up on big tech whose first administration launched several big tech probes. jd vance the incoming vice president has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse. still microsoft has benefited from trump policies in the past. in 2019 the pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that amazon had widely been expected to win. amazon later alleged that trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its amazon web services

background how became the leading cannabis retailer in canada the beginning raj grover the founder and ceo who owns 9 of the company and has never sold a single share comes from an entrepreneurial family and had already experienced success with several smaller businesses before establishing during a business trip to india in search of opportunities in fashion accessories or body jewelry raj stumbled upon the potential of cannabis consumption accessories. recognizing the margin arbitrage opportunity he shipped $10 000 worth of consumption accessories from new delhi to canada and sold everything overnight. after replicating this success a few more times raj decided to open a store. this marked the beginning of high tide s story . in 2009 raj opened smokers corner with an initial investment of less than $50 000 and grew it into a multimillion dollar empire. at that time there were only two or three competitors with unappealing stores. raj believed that by creating a differentiated store in a smart location he could easily capture market share and he was right. by leveraging his established roots in indonesia thailand china and india he was able to not only provide a better customer experience but also offer much cheaper products. cannabis legalization in canada always looking to stay ahead raj seized the opportunity when the prime minister of canada announced that recreational cannabis would soon be legalized. with an existing customer base of cannabis users it made perfect sense for raj to expand into selling cannabis itself. he realized that if he only sold accessories he would eventually lose customers to shops that offered both cannabis and accessories. after nine years of focusing on consumption accessories and accumulating nearly $10m in retained earnings raj raised $88.5m for the first time in 2018 and ventured into the equity markets marking the beginning of high tide s journey as a publicly traded company . with easier access to capital when compared to its peers high tide expanded its footprint across canada highlighted by the significant acquisition of its competitor meta in 2020 which increased the number of stores from 37 to 67. the strategy shift that made everything change around the same time with higher margin profiles a pivotal decision for the company . from acquiring several brands in the u.s. such as smoke cartel fabcbd daily high club dankstop and nuleaf holdings to later acquiring blessedcbd in the uk high tide leveraged its market power to enhance margins and diversify its revenue streams. in the summer of 2021 was accepted for listing on the nasdaq marking a significant milestone. later that year a transformative decision was made high tide launched a discount club model for its retail stores in october 2021 . with consolidated margins higher than any competitor due to the previously mentioned cbd related acquisitions high tide could offer cannabis at remarkably low prices attracting loyal members and rapidly gaining market share . although this discount model initially involved selling cannabis at a loss the move proved to be incredibly successful . high tide s market share increased from less than 4 to over 10 in less than three years despite representing less than 5 of the total cannabis retail store count. today the discount model program has more than 1.5m members and continues to grow each quarter . being the first of its kind discount model was the key differentiating factor that propelled high tide to become the leading cannabis retailer in canada. no competitor could match their prices and raj targeted cannabis users who consumed regularly and were highly price sensitive. when i first started investing in high tide one of its closest competitors was fire flower holdings which ultimately went bankrupt following this price war. there are many more examples of competitors that went bankrupt following this showing how strong has become in the sector. and the consolidation of the market in canada is just starting. this strategy also significantly diminished the illicit market further strengthening high tide s market share. after capturing market share it was time to turn profitable while raj sacrificed margins to achieve this economies of scale and several initiatives aimed at improving margins allowed as well as positive net income in the most recent quarterly results with a consolidated leadership position stronger than ever. overall high tide took a calculated risk to become the leader in the country and it proved to be incredibly successful. this success was only possible due to the ceo s extensive experience in the sector and deep understanding of the cannabis consumer surpassing that of any other management team. what s next for the best is yet to come. while the focus on becoming fcf led to a notable deceleration in revenue growth is now returning to its high growth strategy . despite cannabis being legal for over five years there s still significant market potential to capture in canada. a recent regulatory change in ontario now allows one company to operate up to 150 recreational cannabis stores doubling the previous cap of 75. this change is benefiting large retail chains like capitalizing on the opportunity and targeting the high presence of the illicit market in the region. moreover the canadian market is experiencing significant consolidation allowing high tide to expand its market share organically and through acquisitions at depressed multiples. for example high tide recently acquired a store for 1.5x last quarter s annualized adj. ebitda. the ceo mentioned in the last earnings call that he s in negotiations with a sizable player to acquire additional stores aiming to accelerate its footprint expansion and surpass this year s initial target. every month there are dozens of cannabis stores closing in canada because they simply can t compete with over the next two years high tide is expected to reach a 15 market share up from 12 today. it s worth mentioning that raj and his team have always been methodical in selecting store locations ensuring each one yields significant returns which is why the annual revenue per store at surpasses the industry average by a wide margin. over the next three to five years there s potential to reach an annual revenue of $1b in canada alone . is one of the very few cannabis companies that does not depend on any new legislation to keep growing and improving its bottom line numbers. ongoing developments in the u.s. might give the green light to expand there. high tide with its vast e commerce base of over 3m u.s. customers and profitable operations is poised to leverage these developments. raj grover s strategic approach as a second mover allows him to avoid pitfalls and strategically open stores in key states. the company is ready to capitalize on its strong foundation and scale efficiently aiming to secure significant market share with well chosen locations and a clear expansion strategy. most u.s. operators struggle to turn a profit even with gross margins in the 40 50 range while is both fcf and net income profitable with a gross margin below 30 . while the company doesn t depend on the u.s. market to continue growing this presents an additional catalyst for its upcoming growth trajectory. regardless of whether this expansion happens quickly or not these developments will attract a wave of new investors to the sector and contribute to an overall expansion in multiples. high tide is becoming the costco of cannabis after the success of its free discount model which gathered over 1.5m members in under three years launched elite a paid membership with even better offers . the rollout began slowly but membership is now growing at a record pace 226 yoy and 38 qoq last quarter. it s worth noting that this growth is happening while the subscription price is being raised. although the absolute number is still relatively small at 46 000 the conversion rate of regular club members to elite ones is getting better every quarter. you only need to make a small purchase for the membership price to pay for itself it s exactly like the long term vision is for high tide to be the of cannabis driving strong and predictable cash flows and strengthening high tide s competitive edge . i believe this is one of the catalysts that will help further improve bottom line margins. despite being a retailer with relatively low margins have room to grow . cannabis prices in canada are just starting to stabilize and is waiting for full market stabilization before aggressively launching white labels. while many independents are closing and the market is consolidating isn t raising prices yet to avoid aiding competitors. the long term strategy is to leverage pricing power gradually . when i asked the ceo if fcf margins are nearing a peak the response was clear no there are still many growth opportunities . as the market consolidates and market share increases they anticipate further improvements in both gross and fcf margins plus new areas to explore with scale and other initiatives. valuation is the most superior cannabis business yet the cheapest. retail investors in canada alone have lost over $130b since the 2017 bubble popped so i understand why everyone is wary of this sector. but i have demonstrated how is different from the most well known cannabis companies like and others. high tide generates strong fcf and has a track record of consistently impressive execution . most importantly it has a highly aligned management team that cares about shareholders which is rare in the sector. the fact that this sector is at its peak of pessimism is what makes it possible for us to buy at such a cheap valuation. it s also worth mentioning that unlike the other names mentioned high tide went public late in the game and was not part of the bubble in 2017 2018. that s why it is so underfollowed and why most people don t even know about it.let s check the numbers. generated cad $22.7m in fcf over the last 12 months so it is currently trading at 10x ltm fcf. it s worth noting that this was the first full year of fcf profitability so this number should improve further from here. is the best performing retail cannabis company and one of the very few that is already generating both fcf and net income yet it remains the cheapest . faster growth better margins a superior management team a winning business model the lowest valuation a complete bargain at least in my view. while most investors are avoiding this sector due to the well known companies that destroy shareholder value i m taking advantage of this opportunity by investing in what i consider a hidden gem. before finishing i d like to highlight this has less than 10 institutional ownership while over 75 of the market is owned by institutions. peter lynch often talks about this . if you want to achieve multibagger returns find a hidden gem before the institutions do. for greater understanding look at the company presentation since images are not allowed in the presentation they better

is different. this year i am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. the remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income i usually manage to write off completely as i invest it back into the business. my main expense is rent and utilities other than that i have no other debt aside from small credit card bills current accounts and savings personal checking account $3k keep this empty for monthly expenses only. zero interest. i view this as a pass through account salary in bills out. business checking account $20k this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow i usually try to keep it around $20k thinking i could should move at least 50 into an account that accrues some interest. sep ira 25k i max out the contribution yearly 25 of my w2 income i divide that

[TITLE_END] waymo is setting its sights on its next location the sunshine state. the alphabet owned company announced thursday that it will be hitting the roads in miami. waymo said it will first begin cruising through the florida city with human safety drivers in 2025 before opening doors to riders for its robotaxi service through its waymo one app in 2026. the expansion into miami is indicative of waymo s growing confidence in operating its self driving vehicles in harsher weather conditions in large metropolitan areas in the u.s. waymo first tested in miami in 2019 which the company said helped improve the ability of its self driving vehicles to navigate in wet and rainy conditions. we deepened our learning and understanding of the waymo driver s performance in adverse weather conditions a company spokesperson said. waymo will use what it learned when it returns to the city with its all electric jaguar i paces next year. the company said its initial territory in florida will include some parts of miami s larger metropolitan area which has a population of more than 6 million people. waymo has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding. in november the company announced it was removing its waitlist of about 300 000 people in los angeles so anyone would be able to use waymo one to hail a self driving robotaxi throughout the nearly 80 square miles of los angeles county. the company s ride hailing service also operates citywide in phoenix and san francisco. and in september waymo announced a partnership with uber in austin and atlanta. through that deal uber riders will be able to access waymo s robotaxis through the uber app starting in early 2025 and uber will be responsible for fleet management and operations of the waymo vehicles including maintenance and infrastructure such as vehicle charging cleaning and repairs. additionally waymo on thursday announced that it will partner with mobility company moove to manage its fleet operations facilities and charging infrastructure in both miami and phoenix. moove will begin managing waymo s phoenix fleet in early 2025 a waymo spokesperson said. waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in october to expand its robotaxi service across the u.s. the autonomous vehicle venture s parent company alphabet which also owns google led the funding round alongside earlier backers including andreessen horowitz fidelity perry creek silver lake tiger global and t. rowe price. the robotaxi company said it now sees more than 150 000 paid rides per week via the waymo one app across san francisco phoenix and los angeles. waymo is the only autonomous vehicle developer that currently operates a commercial robotaxi service in several major metro areas across the u.s. but competitors are looming. gm owned cruise is working on bringing its autonomous vehicles back into use on public roads after discontinuing its services following an accident where one of its self driving cars injured a pedestrian in san francisco. tesla meanwhile showed off design concepts for a self driving cybercab and robovan at an event in october. however tesla still classifies the autopilot and full self driving software in its vehicles as partially automated driving systems which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. in an october earnings call tesla ceo elon musk said the company will launch a self driving ride hailing service in california and texas as early as 2025. softbank funded wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in san francisco and amazon owned zoox is also testing its self driving cars which do not feature steering wheels in several u.s. cities. source,waymo expand miami aims launch robotaxi service 2026 waymo

sleeping giant. so kulr just announced they re taking their excess treasury cash and putting it into bitcoin. naturally people are out here talking trash saying things like speculative penny stock dipping into another speculative asset big risk to that i say exactly. this isn t a reckless gamble it s a brilliant strategy for exponential growth. here s why 1 btc as a strategic reserve we ve already seen big players like microstrategy and tesla add bitcoin to their treasuries. why because it s an asymmetric bet on long term value. for a company like $kulr with cutting edge tech in thermal energy management and battery safety this move signals they re not just trying to survive they re playing offense. 2 insane risk reward let s be real we re not buying penny stocks for their blue chip stability. we re here for moonshots. the combo of kulr s strong business fundamentals and a btc kicker could supercharge the stock. the downside is limited but the upside a potential market cap of $5b or more. that s a minimum target imo. 3 ignore the haters people whining about speculation need to get a grip. kulr s tech is already in high demand they re working with nasa the military and ev manufacturers. adding bitcoin to their balance sheet doesn t weaken their core it adds a high risk high reward asset to amplify shareholder returns. 4 perfect timing with bitcoin showing signs of another bull cycle this move could significantly increase their liquidity. think of bitcoin as the ultimate asymmetric hedge it s speculative sure but the rewards far outweigh the risks for a growth stage company like kulr. in summary this isn t some pump and dump vaporware. kulr has legit tech real clients and a bold strategy to maximize growth. the bitcoin play is a cherry on top a calculated move to leverage speculative growth alongside their core business. risk is the name of the game with penny stocks and this one is worth it. my price target $10 short term $30 long term. if their bitcoin gamble pays off this stock could go parabolic. don t miss the boat. thoughts critics let s discuss. edit holy shit look at the numbers 71.8k views in just 6 hours and 6.6k in the past hour alone clearly this is catching fire and for good reason. kulr s decision to allocate up to 90 of their cash reserves into bitcoin isn t just a bold move it s a game changer. not many companies especially at this level are thinking like this. while others are playing it safe and hoarding cash kulr is taking a strategic risk to position themselves as a forward thinking innovator. this isn t just about bitcoin it s about showing they re willing to think outside the box and embrace growth opportunities that most companies are too hesitant to touch. this level of attention proves people are starting to recognize the significance of this move. whether you re bullish or skeptical you can t deny that kulr is making waves. huge moves like this don t happen every day in penny stocks. keep watching this could be the start of something massive. $kulr $kulr,kulr future strategic bitcoin play make penny stock multi bagger kulr future strategic bitcoin play make penny stock multi bagger

2024-12-08,2024-12-08 13:47:50,TSLA,Tesla,investing,i m bullish on rivian and here is why. i m bullish on rivian and here is why. [TITLE_END] currently holding 65 shares looking to round that out to 100 next pay period. i am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. i am simply sharing my thoughts. these are the things i will be watching this year to continue to add to my position or to see if i should reconsider my bullish sentiment. 1. nearing profitability. rivian has recently re affirmed that by q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. they are expected to deliver just over 50 000 vehicles for the year. that is a combination of mostly r1s and r1t with some of the amazon delivery vans. if there guidance is correct and they either meet or beat q4 24 earnings it is a bullish sign. 2. $6 billion loan from uncle sam. now the new administration does create a bit of tension here. the new doge agency is going to be cutting gov. spending across the board. there is some concern they will take away this loan that the biden administration had given to rivian. while this is certainly a possibility i do not think it is going to happen. i think it would be a very bad look politically and would give strength to the argument musk will us his gov. connections to attack his competitors. because of that i think this money is safely staying with rivian. if it turns out doge is going to back down from this threat that is another bullish sign. 3. vw rivian joint venture. vw na is about to change they are getting a new ceo kjell gruner who previously was the president and ceo of porsche cars of north america and then moved to rivian to be there chief commercial officer president business growth . vw desperatley needs software expertise and rivian delivers that in spades. that combined with vws massive buying and production power is a strong match. this is a bullish sign right now and what i think has been pushing to stock upwards. vw has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits. the introduction of the old new scout brand that looks mighty similar to rivians r2 concepts. as well as confirming the deal with rivian it looks like they re finally going to start to take serious steps to rebuilding their reputation especially in na. 4. rivians customers are happy and according to a recent consumer reports survey 86 of owners say they would buy a rivian again better than tesla. if they are happy with their purchase they will talk to their other wealthy friends about their rivian word of mouth is very powerful. 5. the inevitable tesla comparison. rivian is not tesla. now obviously tesla the company in 2024 is very different to tesla the company in 2015. back in 2015 it was the 3rd year of model s production and the first of model x. in 2015 tesla sold just over 50 000 model s. now in 2023 just two years after the rivian r1t debuted rivian sold just over 47 000 vehicles. i think tesla in 2015 is more of a fair comparison to rivian now in 2024 but tesla now in 2024 is not so comparable to rivian now in 2024. i think rivian makes a fantastic product and there s a bright future ahead for them.,m bullish rivian why. m bullish rivian why.

2024-12-09,2024-12-09 16:46:43,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,qubt is about to crash hard qubt is about to crash hard [TITLE_END] context quantum computing is having its moment. it s risky but could massively disrupt industries in areas like computing finance and cyber security. but stock market bubbles are forming. quantum computing is probably the most technically difficult industry for analysts to assess. few people are equipped with an adequate understanding of quantum technologies which is leading to massive mispricing. qubt is junk quantum computing inc. has many problems. iceberg research s recent short report covers some of them. they note that the firm has run from one fad to another and failed at each. they list several misleading claims that qubt has made and withdrawn. the report is damning and raises serious questions about the future of the company i encourage you all to read it. however iceberg does not go far enough. qubt lacks talent. successful quantum innovations requires strong technical knowledge that you really can only come by in either leading universities or megacap firms like google. i went through the linkedin profiles of each of qubt s employees and compared them with their small cap competitors. i tallied up the share of employees that went to an edu rank top 100 world universities for quantum physics qubt ranks incredibly poorly among it s peers less than a fifth of employees . this is robust to different ranking metrics. counting only ivy leagues qubt comes out much worse. but look not all employees are on linkedin. maybe qubt is the next big underdog no. a large share of qubt s talent comes from the steven s institute of technology an unremarkable university in new jersey the company s chief quantum officer is yuping huang. on first glance he appears to have a prolific publishing history however most papers receive low citations and or he is third fourth or fifth author. huang was previously sued by shareholders for breaching fiduciary duties when he merged his previous company qphoton with qubt. notably he is both a qubt director and employee which is a big corporate governance redflag . there is only one independent director with a background in quantum physics to provide checks and balance on huang dr javad shabani. he is not up to the task. his publishing history is mediocre. looking deeper the chief technology officer yong meng sua has an even more mediocre publishing history. and has only risen to an assistant professor role at steven s. he spends much of his time discussing esoteric computing questions tangential to his work and finally the director of the company s chip foundry . dr milan begliarbekov after finishing high school enrolled in a bachelor s degree in english literature at steven s graduated then immediately enrolled in a physics phd at steven s. either he is a savant polymath who is able to pick up grad school physics level math or a phd from steven s is worthless. his publishing career is very mediocre. these scientists will not crack the major problems stopping widespread commercialization of quantum tech. simply compare their publishing records to the founder at ion q or leading quantum scientists at google alongside the significant and verifiable technological advancements these companies have made. another clue that something is amiss is headcount. rigetti has three fold the number of employees as qubt. qbts has six fold. all have similar market cap. what s driving value we ve established that it s not human capital. iceberg s research reveals it s not intellectual property or physical capital either. so why has it done so well qubt s high valuation is driven by regarded retail investors. only 3.3 of qubt is held by institutional investors . compared with 40 for ionq 30 for rgti and 47 for qbts. the lack of institutional investment in qubt while institutional investors are simultaneously clamouring to load up on quantum stocks is a massive red flag that something is up with qubt. in fact no wall street analysts track qubt. so what happens next qubt s 800 rise in one month is going to attract short selling interest as people realise it s junk. the stock will fall back below $1. risk if you want to short buy puts you can rest assured that the company is not going to suddenly become profitable. the main risk comes from why qubt has done so well despite having little revenue expertise or innovation to show for it. qubt is literally called quantum computing incorporated. if you re a full regard wanting to invest in quantum computing are you going to invest in ionq rigetti or a company conveniently called quantum computing it s a regard trap. it s like being interested in electric cars and passing on tesla because you wanted to invest in a stock called electric car co. my positions 1000 put contracts to sell $4.50 cost average 0.11 expiring dec 20. if this doesn t work i m going to buy puts again and

compared to $51.9 billion for console gaming and $40 billion for pc gaming. as of 2024 a significant portion of vr apps in the apple store are likely created using unity with estimates suggesting that over 60 of ar vr content across platforms is made with unity. unity s stock have been doing poorly ever since the great 2022 bear market the john riccitiello fee incident and the dreadful ironsource purchase under his tenure. they have since fired him in 2023 and appointed matthew bromberg as unity s new chief executive officer president and a member of the unity board of directors effective may 15 2024. bromberg has since replaced all the c suites with competent people. they did a reset on their portfolio to put their focus on their core business which they refer to as their strategic portfolio the engine cloud and monetization. the strategic portfolio consists of two main segments create solutions this segment encompasses unity s game development platform and tools. in q3 2024 create solutions revenue grew 5 year over year driven by subscription growth. the create segment includes 1. unity game engine and development tools 2. unity 6 the latest version of the engine with over 500 000 downloads 3. expansion into non gaming industries which grew 59 year over year and represents 18 of create revenue grow solutions this segment includes advertising and monetization tools. in q3 2024 grow solutions revenue declined by 5 . it focuses on 1. advertising technology 2. monetization services for game developers 3. development of a new advertising model set to launch in 2025 let s talk about the mobile gaming monetization and advertising space and their competitor applovin . applovin wanted to buy unity for $20b back in 2022 to form a monopoly but got rejected. unity has since failed to keep up with applovin who is now the third largest mobile gaming in app advertising network after google and meta. unity ironsource platform just can t compete with applovin s superior algos and platform but things are about to change because the new ceo hired jim payne to join the company as chief product officer for advertising effective august 12 2024. payne co founded mopub the world s largest mobile in app ad server and exchange and max advertising systems a mobile header bidding platform . in their latest earning s call bromberg said they have a new machine learning model in their new neural network that is being tested on their live data that will be ready to launch when it s ready . app s current mcap is $111b while unity is at $10.78b if their new ml model is competitive the stock can easily 5x from here just from the grow solutions business . this is why some people are looking to short applovin and long unity. on the create solution side unity recently announced on oct 30 2024 they hired ex king cto and havok co founder steve collins as cto which will add key technical leadership to accelerate product innovation quality and stability. in 2023 havok products were used in twelve of the top twenty best selling video games in the united states. here are a you probably heard of that used havok physics dark souls 1 3 bloodborne bioshock series cs go

dod the department of defense primarily uses the unity engine to create realistic immersive virtual training simulations for military personnel allowing them to practice complex scenarios in a safe

awarded two significant contracts related to the u.s. department of defense multiple award indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract. this contract has a maximum value of $12 billion and will provide a broad range of it related services to the entire dod for up to 12 years. caci contract unity signed a multi million dollar contract with enterprise technology firm caci to become the preferred real time 3d platform for u.s. government defense projects. i don t think even the palantards know this offering is built with unity s 3d engine. now let s rewind it back to 2015 when access to the platform. one of the possible reasons the acquisition fell through is antitrust concerns because meta would be a monopoly in vr ar if they own unity. i believe the future is xr and that xr will be next major computing platform after mobile. i believe meta will become the largest company in the world within the next 10 20 years which is why i m highly optimistic about unity given its

[TITLE_END] tesla shares jumped to an all time high on wednesday surpassing their prior record reached in 2021 sparked by a post election rally and wall street s increased enthusiasm for elon musk s electric vehicle company. the stock rose to an intraday high of $415 which is 50 cents above its previous peak and was on pace to close ahead of its highest finish which was $409.97 on nov. 4 2021. tesla s market value has swelled by about 66 this year with almost all of those gains coming since donald trump s election victory early last month. the stock s 38 rally in november marked its best monthly performance since january of 2023 and its 10th best on record. musk poured $277 million into a pro trump campaign effort according to federal election commission filings and turned his support for the republican nominee into another full time job ahead of the election funding a swing state operation to register voters and using his social media platform x to constantly tout his preferred candidate frequently with misinformation. the world s richest person who s seen his net worth swell to over $360 billion is set to lead the trump administration s department of government efficiency alongside onetime republican presidential candidate vivek ramaswamy. his new role could give musk power over federal agencies budgets staffing and the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. musk said during a tesla earnings call in october that he intended to use his sway with trump to establish a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles. currently approvals happen at the state level. the stock is responding to the trump bump craig irwin an analyst at roth mkm told cnbc s squawk on the street last week. irwin had just increased his price target to $380 from $85 writing in a report that musk s authentic support for trump likely doubled tesla s pool of enthusiasts and lifted credibility for a demand inflection. on wednesday analysts at goldman sachs boosted their price target on tesla joining a parade of firms that have lifted their price expectation or their rating on the stock. the goldman analysts wrote that the market is taking a more forward looking approach to tesla including with respect to its ai opportunity. analysts at morgan stanley and bank of america have also issued bullish reports of late. since trump s victory musk has been accompanying the president elect in meetings with world leaders and began advising him and members of congress as to which federal agencies regulations and budget items the billionaire would like to eliminate or greatly reduce. tesla s surge to a record marks a dramatic turn from its performance to start the year. the company s shares plunged 29 in the first three months of 2024 the worst quarter for the stock since the end of 2022 and the third worst since tesla went public in 2010. at the time investors were concerned about tesla s core business which reported declining revenue in the first quarter in part due to increased competition from china. in its third quarter earnings report in october tesla reported a year over year revenue increase of 8 which fell just shy of estimates. however the company reported better than expected profit and musk said on the earnings call that his best guess is that vehicle growth will reach 20 to 30 next year due to lower cost vehicles and the advent of autonomy. that forecast was ahead of analysts predictions. source,tesla shares climb record boosted 64 pop trump election victory tesla shares climb record boosted 64 pop

the stock that might just be the most murica thing since bald eagles on monster energy cans. ondas holdings inc. is here to ride the wave of border walls drones and some ai wizardry. with trump back in office and an inevitable boost in defense spending onds could be the sleeper pick of the year. let s break it down in terms even your ape brains can understand. what s the play onds isn t your basic drone company. it s got four killer verticals that make it the ultimate bet on maga era defense infrastructure and tech spending 1. autonomous drones products optimus systems these drones basically never sleep. they re like your ex but useful doing 24 7 surveillance for infrastructure border patrol and even dubai police. scout system a drone in a box setup for industrial monitoring. think of it as big brother for factories. why this matters now trump loves big beautiful walls and surveillance tech to guard the homeland. onds drones can patrol borders autonomously. imagine a giant drone wall that never stops. 2. mission critical networks products a fancy 900 mhz network made for railroads utilities and public safety. it s not just wi fi it s industrial grade super secure and built to last. deployed with metra and big rail players like union pacific. if the train system gets upgraded onds wins. why this matters now the trump admin is all about america first and that means beefing up critical infrastructure. think railroads power grids and public safety networks. onds has the goods to cash in on this spending spree. 3. counter drone solutions products iron drone raider this bad boy literally catches rogue drones. it s like pok mon go for homeland security. why this matters now increased focus on securing airspace. airports military bases and critical infrastructure don t need karen s amazon drone snooping around. the pentagon might be writing ondas a fat check soon. 4. artificial intelligence products ai to make all the above smarter. think autonomous decision making for drones and optimizing mission critical networks. why this matters now uncle sam loves ai. ondas ai enhanced tech fits perfectly into defense strategies for smarter surveillance and threat detection. show me the tendies onds is still in its early innings but let s look at the numbers. q3 revenue $1.48m. it s not tesla numbers but they ve got contracts rolling in from railroads and homeland security deals. they won $14.4m of contracts in q3 $9m of which was for the iron drone. cash update after a convertible noteholder pumped in $4m recently onds has a total cash war chest of $6.9m . not great not terrible but enough to push the business forward until more deals hit. why trump s win makes onds a buy border security drones patrolling the wall perfect synergy. defense spending counter drone tech mission critical networks and ai systems are top priorities for securing the homeland. infrastructure ondas railroad tech plays into the maga promise of fixing america s crumbling infrastructure. we re talking $$$ contracts for upgrades. drones are hot just look at what happened with rcat over the last month. this sector is just getting started and the upside potential on this is huge. but what could go wrong 1. cashflow problems $6.9m is better than $2.9m but they ll still need more funding to grow. not a biggie if they keep closing deals though. 2. competition the drone market is heating up. onds has niche tech but staying ahead of the pack won t be easy. 3. execution risks scaling hardware software tech isn t simple. they ve gotta deliver. my bullish thesis ondas is the perfect storm of defense tech and maga era spending priorities. the trump administration is a literal gold mine for this kind of tech. drones on the border check. counter drone systems for homeland security check. rail upgrades for maga s infrastructure promises check. onds isn t just a bet on drones. it s a bet on murica . final thoughts onds is a high risk high reward play. they ve got the tech the partnerships and the perfect timing with trump s focus on defense and infrastructure. if this stock doesn t moon by q2 2025 i ll eat my portfolio . buy the dip

adopted. but first briefly the story of my initial failure. when i started managing my portfolio i quickly learned about the s p 500 but was convinced i was smart enough to outperform the market. arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall. in 2019 i flirted with bitcoin which initially delivered great returns. encouraged by the hype i also invested heavily in paysafe shortly after its ipo believing in its potential because everyone said it was going to be great. at the same time i was doing a lot of day trading. looking back i realize i wasn t trading rationally. i d look at graphs and invest simply because i felt the price would go up. i was taking desirable outcomes for granted. although i made a few conservative and reasonable investments their success couldn t offset the losses caused by bitcoin s decline paysafe s terrible performance and my risky trading. after 18 months my portfolio was down 40 . the arrogance i started with made the loss feel devastating. i abandoned my investment account for several years. when i returned to it a year ago i discovered that the growth of my conservative investments along with bitcoin s recovery had boosted my portfolio to 20 growth from my initial investment. i sold everything and bought into the s p 500 feeling that i wasn t capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund. this turned out to be a good action as the s p 500 performed very well this year. now i feel i ve learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again. to avoid repeating the same mistakes i ve set specific rules to guide me 1. i avoid speculative investments i now steer clear of speculative assets like crypto ipo stocks or companies like tesla. i want to be a disciplined investor keeping my greed under control. 2. i reject market timing i no longer believe in timing the market but instead focus on time in the market. i avoid trying to buy low today and sell high tomorrow because it s too easy to confuse wishful thinking with reality. paying attention to micro events can help to take advantage of daily fluctuations but it requires too much time and still offers uncertain outcomes. more often than not it doesn t pay off. 3. focus on debt to equity in the past i ignored the debt to equity ratio. now i prioritize companies with consistent net income and manageable debt levels. 4. limit individual stock exposure i cap my individual stock picks at 5 of my total portfolio. previously this rule would have forced me to find 20 or more stocks to invest in leading to choosing assets that were just okay rather than ones i genuinely liked. thankfully with most of my portfolio now in the s p 500 individual stock picks act as a good supplement rather than a replacement for the index. 5. invest in goods and services i value my approach to stock selection has shifted. i now look for companies whose products and services i personally interact with and consider them of great value. if the companies also demonstrate strong financial performance and maintain a reasonable debt to equity ratio they become my choice. i hope these rules will help me sleep well at night keep me from obsessing over financial news and generate decent returns that complement the s p 500.,returning active stock portfolio management returning active stock portfolio management [TITLE_END] recently

s weekly dd [TITLE_END] hey everyone here are some of the stocks i have been liking most as of late. zomd has been mentioned a lot lately by me but they are just doing very well so pls allow it. mate is a new play that looks slightly like a no brainer at these levels and sbbc has been one i ve liked for a while. i hope these notes can be of value to anyone please feel free to comment any tickers you would like me to check out i have found a lot of solid picks from past commenters cheers blockmate ventures inc. $mate.v $matef market cap $13m company overview blockmate is a blockchain focused company with its main asset being hivello. hivello is a decentralized platform where users can share their computing resources for things like ai modelling storage and vpn services. in return they get paid in tokens. blockmate owns more than 50 of hivello and is targeting growth in regions like africa and asia where this kind of income could really take off. highlights right now the big story with blockmate is hivello. the platform makes it easy for people to earn passive income anywhere from $20 to $300 a month by running nodes. for users in developing countries this extra money could go a long way and the potential to scale quickly in these markets is a huge opportunity. hivello recently raised $3.5m at a $30m usd valuation. blockmate s stake alone is worth over $0.20 cad per share which is double the stock s current price . once the financing closes it could bring even more attention to the company. the hivello token launch planned for q1 2025 is another big catalyst. if the token takes off it could create a cycle where more users join the token value rises and the platform gains even more traction. early beta testing has been looking promising and the company plans to grow the user base quickly with partnerships and rental programs for people who don t already own equipment. financially blockmate is in a good spot. recent warrant exercises added to their cash reserves and the company is keeping its operations lean. domenic carosa the president owns 20m shares so he s clearly invested in the company s success. i just like this play because obviously crypto is hot right now and of all the different narratives and use cases for blockchain tech depin is one of the most promising imo. zoomd technologies ltd. $zmdtf $zomd.v market cap 74m company overview

2024-12-16,2024-12-16 09:23:04,TSLA,Tesla,wallstreetbets,tesla bull and bear case the great ai and liability gamble tesla bull and bear case the great ai and liability gamble [TITLE_END] tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently nearly doubling to $1.4t market cap in just three months. the catalyst is trump s victory and elon musk s instrumental role in it. investors expect elon s influence to relax regulations clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout a potential game changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole. tesla is trading like an ai startup and for good reason its full self driving system is at the heart of the valuation. but investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look. the bull case tesla s data volume tesla has a massive data advantage. with over 4 million vehicles on the road each equipped with a suite of cameras tesla s fleet constantly collects real world driving data. this data acts as a shadow trainer for its ai gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. meanwhile fsd subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the ai providing tesla with even more labeled data. behind the scenes tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases rare and tricky driving scenarios. tesla combines supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its ai. more importantly tesla s massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume which usually means better machine learning.on top of this tesla s vision only approach using cameras without lidar makes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. the result a system that could be deployed anywhere in the world not just pre mapped areas. the bear case quantity vs. quality more data is not always better and it s possible that tesla might reach a plateau. teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments where edge cases are relatively rare while waymo trains their ai in dense chaotic urban areas. the result is a more diverse dataset that s constantly evolving. waymo is owned by alphabet and has been operating fully autonomous l4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. it uses both cameras and lidar. combining 2d and 3d data in this way is something tesla initially set out but failed to do. elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of since it often conflicted with the vision data. but waymo has somehow managed to make it work. this means that its data is much richer in quality. the urban focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than tesla s suburban heavy dataset giving its ai a potentially richer training environment. the geofencing that tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for waymo. by limiting its operations to pre mapped areas waymo minimizes liability and achieves level 4 autonomy with real world deployments today. tesla by comparison is still at level 2 which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. moving from l2 to l4 isn t just an incremental step it s an order of magnitude leap in complexity. tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. waymo trains its ai in the most chaotic environments places like san francisco and new york city. tesla s fsd by contrast collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. cities provide more edge cases such as jaywalking pedestrians aggressive lane merges and unexpected construction detours. as the saying goes if you can make it here you can make it anywhere. if waymo s ai can survive the chaos of manhattan or downtown la it s far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. in contrast tesla s suburban data might create a same shit different day scenario where the ai becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare high stakes scenarios. regulatory relaxation is a double edged sword if musk succeeds in relaxing regulations tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. in theory this could limit tesla s liability especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. however accidents involving unsuspecting third parties remain a significant risk. under current frameworks manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles meaning tesla could face infinite exposure even for a small number of accidents. even if musk changes the regulatory framework courts ultimately determine liability and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best complicity at worst. tesla s data suggests fsd already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics which is very impressive. however publishing accident rates also acknowledges that fsd causes accidents. they currently get away with it because again l2 puts the onus on the driver. but it s a different story if they deploy robotaxis as l3 or l4. in that case any accident caused by fsd is the onus of tesla exposing them to unlimited liability. the scalability myth tesla bulls often criticize waymo s reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable but this argument doesn t hold weight for two reasons. first lidar is becoming much cheaper and with volume production costs could approach tesla s camera only system. ironically elon s first principles philosophy should be applied here just because something was a certain way before doesn t mean it has to be that way. secondly the market for taxis in general is urban. when was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed giving it a more focused path to profitability. tesla vs. waymo is really tesla vs. google waymo uses millions of ai generated simulations to train its system. it s ai teaching ai similar to how alphago and alphazero were trained. tesla may also use simulations but waymo s superior compute power means it s clearly dominant in this regard. tesla bulls often cite elon s dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of tesla s superior approach. but they overlook google s hegemony in ai. they were in the game before anyone. they delivered alphago alphafold and many other paradigm shifting world changing products backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. tesla s dojo may be promising but it s still a newbie. tl dr tesla s $1.4t valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving which is to say its lead in ai. if tesla dominates ai the stock might still be undervalued. but the data quantity vs. data quality liability risks and waymo

2024-12-17,2024-12-17 01:24:17,TSLA,Tesla,investing,ponzi spotting a laymen s guide to differentiating investments from ponzi schemes ponzi spotting a laymen s guide to differentiating investments from ponzi schemes [TITLE_END] i often see things being called ponzi schemes on reddit that are very much not ponzi schemes. usually it always stems from the criticism that a particular investment only goes up in price because someone newer is paying a higher price for it. hence it must be a ponzi. i m going to blow your minds a little bit. almost all investments require new investors willing to pay a higher price for older investors to cash out a profit. most investable objects regardless of what underlies the object trade at a price on a market. this means at the margin some percentage of the total available supply of the object is trading hands. the trade is priced typically in your local fiat currency but this does not necessarily have to be the case. prices are determined by supply and demand. when an investable object goes up in price on a market it means there were no sellers of the object at the lower price and price goes up until the next marginal seller decides they are willing to part with that object at the higher price. the use of the term investable object is intentionally left extremely broad. it essentially means anything quantifiable that can be owned and traded. this includes contracts stocks bonds physical objects digital objects etc. example 1. you bought a 1st edition charizard for 20 dollars when it came out in the 1990 s. since it was relatively abundant and pokemon was relatively new at the time the supply was high and the demand was low. fast forward 30 years pokemon is super popular and there are very few 1st edition charizards remaining . you now are able to sell the charizard for 10 000 dollars to a guy that just got into pokemon card collecting. congratulations you bought low and sold high was what you participated in a ponzi scheme because you made a profit by selling to a new investor i really hope your answer to this is no. if you think the answer is yes you can stop reading here because i don t think anything i m going to say beyond this point is going to help you. the next step in logic is realizing this charizard example is essentially how all investment returns are made when the investable object at hand is not providing a direct flow of cash. this is true for non dividend stocks derivatives physical collectibles like pet rocks beanie babies tulip bulbs and digital collectibles like in game skins nfts cryptocurrencies etc. examples of cash flowing investments would be dividend stocks direct ownership of small businesses such that net profits are available to you or rental properties. it is important to note while ultimately supply and demand determine if a price for an investable object goes up over time the underlying reason an investable object has demand at all can be wildly different from object to object. the reason some people want first edition charizards is usually a very different reason people want to own a stock of a company. it is within the eye of the investor to decide if the reason is a good reason and hopefully a reason that leads to increased demand in the future. so what is a ponzi according to chatgpt a ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment scam that promises high returns with little or no risk to investors. the scheme relies on using the funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors rather than generating legitimate profit from actual investments or business activities. eventually the scheme collapses when it becomes impossible to recruit enough new investors or when too many existing investors try to withdraw their money at the same time. that seems like a pretty good definition to me the part that everyone focuses on when thinking about a ponzi is this part the scheme relies on using funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors. this sounds extremely similar to my charizard example yet i hope you have the intellectual honesty to accept that a real ponzi scheme is different from buying low and selling high. the part that is extremely important in addition to old investor returns being funded by new investors is that the scheme promises a return. the reality is that many ponzi schemes do not start off as ponzi schemes. there are sometimes investment funds that partake briefly in ponzi like behavior to paper over potential insolvency during a downturn and then return to legitimate investment activities when the market improves. doing this is quite risky and is still illegal because if you aren t able to essentially over deliver on future returns to even things out you re essentially stuck in an endless cycle of repaying old investors who cash out with newer investor money turning your once legitimate investment fund into a ponzi scheme. the right move is to always be open and honest about what returns you re able to achieve for your investors to avoid being stuck in the ponzi loop i described. another attribute of ponzi schemes is that ponzi s almost always violently collapse once the perceived value of the fund goes down. this is because once a ponzi stops attracting new money it becomes apparent very quickly that the liabilities of the fund far outstrip the assets. example 2. imagine a hypothetical ponzi scheme. the ponzi fund initially accepted $1 000 dollars from 10 eager investors in a local town. the fund manager promises a 10 annual yield so that in 1 year s time any of the original investors can withdraw $1 100 if they so please. unfortunately our manager really sucks at operating this ponzi and after 1 year obtains exactly zero new clients. his liabilities at the end of the year are now $11 000 but he only has $10 000 of cash on hand. even more unfortunately for him taylor swift is announced to be coming to town and tickets are on sale now and the tickets incidentally cost $1 100. all his investors want to cash out immediately so they ask for their money back. the first 9 that come to him are able to get their money back . when the 10th person comes back he realizes there s only $100 for him not the $1 100 he was promised the fund not only has basically no money left it owes $1000. the 10th person notifies the police and our unfortunate fund manager is arrested for fraud. i will note that in this example this scheme required 90 of the investors to withdraw for the scheme to collapse but examples in history tend to be much more skewed where even a small withdrawal of 1 5 of investors can completely collapse the scheme. returning to the investable object definition once a ponzi runs out of new investors to pay prior investors the investable object completely disappears because the fund you thought was flush with desirable investable objects actually had a negative cash balance the entire time behind the curtain there actually was no object at all. this is in contrast to our buy low sell high example with the charizard card. the charizard market could hypothetically collapse tomorrow such that the market price drops from $10 000 to $1. maybe everyone collectively realizes pokemon is super lame and that yugioh is the superior card game. at the end of the day there are two truths you still own the investable object aka the charizard and no one promised you a return for owning it. you can always wait it out hoping that people become interested in charizards again. i hope this somewhat lengthy piece was helpful in elucidating ponzi schemes for anyone that read this far. i often see clearly non ponzi investable objects being echo chambered as ponzi s on reddit when it really stems from a misunderstanding of the investable object or the mechanics of investment itself. if your investable object trades on an open market and nominal gains are made through price increases due to supply and demand dynamics it is almost certainly not a ponzi. if nobody is promising you a return it also probably isn t a ponzi. this does not mean your investable object itself is not a scam or a bubble. that determination should be made with your best judgment of the fundamentals that underlie the object itself. i will leave you with 2 final examples to illustrate this. example 3. tesla stock is neither a ponzi nor a scam . it might be a bubble if you think the company s market cap is too high for what its future profits will be. example 4. nikola stock is not a ponzi but it was a scam. the ceo lied to investors about how functional the cars were and how many they sold .,ponzi spotting laymen s guide differentiating investments ponzi schemes ponzi spotting laymen s guide differentiating investments ponzi schemes [TITLE_END] things called ponzi schemes reddit ponzi schemes. usually stems criticism particular investment goes price newer paying higher price it. ponzi. m going blow minds little bit. investments require new investors willing pay higher price older investors cash profit. investable objects regardless underlies object trade price market. means margin percentage total available supply object trading hands. trade priced typically local fiat currency does necessarily case. prices determined supply demand. investable object goes price market means sellers object lower price price goes marginal seller decides willing object higher price. use term investable object intentionally left extremely broad. essentially means quantifiable owned traded. includes contracts stocks bonds physical objects digital objects etc. example 1. bought 1st edition charizard 20 dollars came 1990 s. relatively abundant pokemon relatively new time supply high demand low. fast forward 30 years pokemon super popular 1st edition charizards remaining . able sell charizard 10 000 dollars guy just got pokemon card collecting. congratulations bought low sold high participated ponzi scheme profit selling new investor really hope answer no. think answer yes stop reading don t think m going say point going help you. step logic realizing charizard example essentially investment returns investable object hand providing direct flow cash. true non dividend stocks derivatives physical collectibles like pet rocks beanie babies tulip bulbs digital collectibles like game skins nfts cryptocurrencies etc. examples cash flowing investments dividend stocks direct ownership small businesses net profits available rental properties. important note ultimately supply demand determine price investable object goes time underlying reason investable object demand wildly different object object. reason people want edition charizards usually different reason people want stock company. eye investor decide reason good reason hopefully reason leads increased demand future. ponzi according chatgpt ponzi scheme fraudulent investment scam promises high returns little risk investors. scheme relies using funds new investors pay returns earlier investors generating legitimate profit actual investments business activities. eventually scheme collapses impossible recruit new investors existing investors try withdraw money time. like pretty good definition focuses thinking ponzi scheme relies using funds new investors pay returns earlier investors. sounds extremely similar charizard example hope intellectual honesty accept real ponzi scheme different buying low selling high. extremely important addition old investor returns funded new investors scheme promises return. reality ponzi schemes start ponzi schemes. investment funds partake briefly ponzi like behavior paper potential insolvency downturn return legitimate investment activities market improves. doing quite risky illegal aren t able essentially deliver future returns things essentially stuck endless cycle repaying old investors cash newer investor money turning legitimate investment fund ponzi scheme. right open honest returns able achieve investors avoid stuck ponzi loop described. attribute ponzi schemes ponzi s violently collapse perceived value fund goes down. ponzi stops attracting new money apparent quickly liabilities fund far outstrip assets. example 2. imagine hypothetical ponzi scheme. ponzi fund initially accepted $1 000 dollars 10 eager investors

able money . 10th person comes realizes s $100 $1 100 promised fund basically money left owes $1000. 10th person notifies police unfortunate fund manager arrested fraud. note example scheme required 90 investors withdraw scheme collapse examples history tend skewed small withdrawal 1 5 investors completely collapse scheme. returning investable object definition ponzi runs new investors pay prior investors investable object completely disappears fund thought flush desirable investable objects actually negative cash balance entire time curtain actually object all. contrast buy low sell high example charizard card. charizard market hypothetically collapse tomorrow market price drops $10 000 $1. maybe collectively realizes pokemon super lame yugioh superior card game. end day truths investable object aka charizard promised return owning it. wait hoping people interested charizards again. hope somewhat lengthy piece helpful elucidating ponzi schemes read far. clearly non ponzi investable objects echo chambered ponzi s reddit really stems misunderstanding investable object mechanics investment itself. investable object trades open market nominal gains price increases supply demand dynamics certainly ponzi. promising return probably isn t ponzi. does mean investable object scam bubble. determination best judgment fundamentals underlie object itself. leave 2 final examples

2024-12-18,2024-12-18 08:50:26,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,nvidia s recent decline and opportunities for a new rally nvidia s recent decline and opportunities for a new rally [TITLE_END] nvidia fell nearly 4 today before narrowing the loss to 1.22 . since hitting a record closing high of $148.88 in early november the ai chip maker s stock has dropped over 10 . so what is causing nvidia s decline 1. supply chain issues and challenges nvidia faces multiple challenges in its supply chain a significant factor in its stock decline. first according to the latest data the order volume and schedules for the gb200 and gb300 have been adjusted. particularly the mass production and shipment of gb series products have been postponed until after the lunar new year in february increasing market uncertainty. additionally the small scale production plans for gb300 face tight deadlines putting pressure on gb200 s mass production. specific supply chain issues include cowos l packaging technology heating problems copper cable connections and leakage issues. these not only affect product yield rates but also increase system integration time costs. consequently nvidia has suggested customers purchase the b200 8 card hgx as a transitional solution and clients like microsoft are considering switching their orders. these supply chain issues affect nvidia s product delivery capabilities and reduce market expectations for its future performance. 2. market competition and narrative changes asics are gaining market recognition as a competitive narrative. asics are chips designed for specific tasks akin to custom running shoes for a race. for certain tasks asics outperform nvidia s gpus and are potentially cheaper. openai co founder ilya and industry leaders like microsoft s ceo satya have started discussing the importance of not only training ai models but also ensuring they can quickly and accurately make decisions in real applications. this shift in perspective gives asics an advantage in some scenarios as they are designed for rapid precise execution of tasks. this raises questions about the cost of nvidia s gpus. while powerful they are expensive and require significant electricity and cooling. as asics perform better at lower costs for some tasks there s consideration of replacing nvidia s gpus with asics. additionally changes in scaling law narratives and the strengthening of inference narratives pose threats to nvidia. scaling laws suggest that increasing ai model size typically improves performance but these gains are not infinite and require significant computational resources. this means nvidia must continually invest resources to improve product performance potentially increasing costs. moreover companies like btc tesla and google are investing heavily in their own ai chips or solutions. this intensifies market competition and challenges nvidia s leadership. 3. market sentiment and capital flows market sentiment and capital flow significantly impact nvidia s stock price. as the year ends retail investors etfs and institutions adjust their portfolios. fluctuations in tech giants like microsoft apple and google affect tech stocks like nvidia. investors are more cautious favoring stable promising companies. given these conditions nvidia faces pressure on its stock price due to supply chain issues and competition. lowered expectations for nvidia s future performance lead to capital outflows and stock price declines. 4. future outlook and catalysts despite current challenges nvidia has opportunities for a turnaround. first nvidia needs to resolve supply chain issues improve product yield and delivery capabilities. second strengthening its presence in software and applications is crucial to addressing market competition. additionally nvidia should explore new computing narratives to expand its computing potential. 5. technical analysis and price divergence previously prices rose continuously but volume and kdj began to decline showing divergence. without capital support upward momentum was insufficient leading to a short term adjustment and a break below the mid term trend line resulting in a mid term adjustment. when might a new rally occur from a technical analysis perspective after two prior mid term adjustments breaking the downward trend line may signal the start of a new rally. thus this new rally must first break the resistance line. from a catalyst perspective while january s ces and the earnings release in late february may not bring major surprises march s gtc is worth anticipating. nvidia needs to showcase new technologies and products at this event to restore market confidence. if nvidia can introduce groundbreaking innovations a stock rebound is possible.,nvidia

2024-12-18,2024-12-18 20:17:31,TSLA,Tesla,wallstreetbets,self driving business grows 6x uber is clearly misplaced by the market and is on the verge of 50 upside self driving business grows 6x uber is clearly misplaced by the market and is on the verge of 50 upside [TITLE_END] shares of uber have fallen more than 30 from their october 2024 highs in just a few weeks on concerns that self driving cars could eliminate intermediary services while news such as google s waymo skipping uber to enter the self driving cab business in miami is thought provoking enough to make some investors uneasy uber s positioning as the transportation app for everyone an aggregator of all transportation needs for more than 160 million consumers makes it an inevitable market platform for self driving car companies. this makes it an inevitable market platform for self driving car companies. tesla and google have deep pockets but building a bilateral network of self driving cabs from scratch would cost tens of billions of dollars take years to achieve scalable economics and make it difficult to change customer behavior despite the novelty of driverless cabs. additionally uber has partnered with several av providers to bring self driving cabs to its platform from an economic standpoint it makes more sense to partner with uber as an av supplier than to try to create demand on a new network of self driving cabs with a limited and expensive av fleet. now in the past uber s leadership team has used self driving cars as tam extenders which is the right thought process as increased supply in the form of robo taxis could potentially lower uber s cost per mile which in turn would push penetration and total bookings higher the growth of the self driving car market will unfold over the next decade or two so it seems premature to abandon uber based on concerns about disintermediation. as long as uber s business grows as planned there s no reason to panic sell. on the contrary uber stock s recent decline has significantly improved its long term risk reward with tqi s five year expected compound annual growth rate for uber jumping from 16.1 to 25.8 . based on forward looking estimates uber s revenue will continue to grow at a healthy double digit rate over the next five years as a result in today s valuation the analysts are sticking with the growth and margin assumptions used in their previous assessment of uber. that is updating uber s revenue base to $43.71 billion and updating the stock count to 2.154 billion shares. all other assumptions remain unchanged and relatively simple. based on the valuation model uber s fair value is approximately $105.50 per share or currently undervalued by approximately 45 . in addition given the sharp decline uber s long term risk reward has improved considerably. given its 5 year expected compound annual growth rate is currently about 25.8 well above our 15 investment threshold rate. in a historically expensive stock market uber is now one of the few large tech stocks that offer amazing value uber is making every effort to become a reliable money printing machine. given uber s fast growing cash flow production and the shareholder friendly capital allocation policies adopted by management investors had plenty of margin of safety in this large tech stock. now uber stock is finally pulling back. yes uber s image has

over year to $40.97 billion driven by healthy growth in mapc and mapc usage frequency . additionally uber s cash conversion continued to improve at a rapid pace in q3 with free cash flow increasing 133 year over year to $2.1 billion. from a technical perspective uber shares are above the 100 week moving average which could be strong support. additionally the 200 week moving average is at $47. given that uber s weekly rsi is near oversold territory the $47 $57 range is a strong buy zone for long term investors.,self driving business grows 6x uber clearly misplaced market verge 50 upside

learned compounding takes time but works i ve started noticing compounding effects really kick in. some months my portfolio s growth outpaced my monthly salary which is both surreal and inspiring. volatility is real watching significant swings in my portfolio value is tough. to manage this i ve adopted a set it and forget it mindset and avoid checking my account daily. stay consistent it s easy to get caught up in market trends and daily life but staying consistent with contributions has been the most rewarding strategy. why i m sharing i hope to inspire others who might be hesitant about investing. i realize $1 000 isn t possible for everyone i m extremely lucky to be able to do this but i think starting with even $50 a week or a month can be impactful. financial independence is achievable with consistency discipline and patience. for transparency i focus solely on my brokerage account in these posts even though i also fully fund my roth ira 403 and my wife s self directed 401. we also maintain a hands off acorns account with about $60 000. i ve thought about moving that money to fidelity but appreciate the safety and simplicity it offers. looking ahead starting in

2024-12-30,2024-12-30 16:54:41,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,the top 5 performing stocks of the past decade have one thing in common the top 5 performing stocks of the past decade have one thing in common [TITLE_END] the five best performing stocks of the past decade nvidia amd camtek fair isaac and tesla have one thing in common their stock prices have all experienced at least one drop of 50 or more. for example tesla s stock dropped by more than 70 and nvidia experienced a 66 decline in 2022. these sharp fluctuations caused many investors to panic and sell. however if we had sold during these major drops we would have missed out on the subsequent huge gains these stocks have had compound annual growth rates ranging from 40 to 75 for instance if you had invested $10 000 in tesla ten years ago it would now be worth $290 000 and nvidia return is even more impressive with a $10 000 investment now worth nearly $2.7 million this made me realize that an important investment principle is to let your winners keep winning while there are only a few winners in the market if we can hold on to them in our portfolio the returns can be very significant. however to do this investors need to overcome the fear of large price fluctuations and avoid selling when prices drop it is often only after such fluctuations that these stocks experience the next big rise investment guru charlie munger once said if you can t calmly endure a 50 drop in stock prices two or three times you re not suited to be a common shareholder i have come to understand that market volatility is inevitable and investors must learn to accept significant price swings and remain calm during downturns the key is to have a clear investment thesis when buying stocks understand the company s long term value and compare the company s performance to your judgment. if things are progressing as expected holding on is usually a good idea because it gives you confidence during market turbulence in summary one of the most important investment principles is to continue holding on to the stocks that are performing well even if they experience significant volatility. volatility is part of the market and only by having strong conviction can we maintain long term returns through market turbulence,5 performing stocks past decade thing common 5 performing stocks past decade thing common [TITLE_END] best performing stocks past decade nvidia amd camtek fair isaac tesla thing common stock prices experienced drop 50 more. example tesla s stock dropped 70 nvidia experienced 66 decline 2022. sharp fluctuations caused investors panic sell. sold major drops missed subsequent huge gains stocks compound annual growth rates ranging 40 75 instance invested $10 000 tesla years ago worth $290 000 nvidia return impressive $10 000 investment worth nearly $2.7 million realize important investment principle let winners winning winners market hold portfolio returns significant. investors need overcome fear large price fluctuations avoid selling prices drop fluctuations stocks experience big rise investment guru charlie munger said t calmly endure 50 drop stock prices times suited common shareholder come understand market volatility inevitable investors learn accept significant price swings remain calm downturns key clear investment thesis buying stocks understand company s long term value compare company s performance judgment. things progressing expected holding usually good idea gives confidence market turbulence summary important investment principles continue holding stocks performing experience significant volatility. volatility market having strong conviction maintain long term returns market turbulence,2

most abundant and freely available resource on earth. everyone can breathe it without restriction it s everywhere and it costs nothing. now imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles claiming only 21 million bottles will ever exist. they sell the bottles marketing them as rare and special and soon the price of a single bottle soars to $100 000. but here s the catch anyone can grab the same air bottle it themselves impose their own arbitrary limits and sell it too. the air inside these bottles is identical same purity same ability to sustain life. yet somehow the original company convinces people their air is unique while the others are dismissed as worthless. this isn t just absurd but comically irrational. and yet it s a perfect analogy for bitcoin. think about it bottling air to sell is ridiculous. why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available worse imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system one consuming massive amounts of electricity requiring complex networks and involving global participants to package transfer and store this bottled air. this is the level of absurdity we reach with bitcoin. bitcoin s defenders often point to its decentralization anonymity and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. but what is this decentralized system really securing digital air. the units being produced transferred and protected represent nothing they are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. anyone with the technical knowledge can clone bitcoin s code impose their own arbitrary cap and launch their own cryptocurrency. this brings us to the critical difference between bitcoin and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless. stocks represent ownership in a company. a company cannot be copied like a piece of code. the value of a share is tied to the performance assets and operations of that unique entity. you cannot clone tesla or apple and therefore you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite tied to real world assets operations and innovation. fiat currencies on the other hand represent units of debt. they are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers companies governments or individuals to repay them. banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. no one can walk into a bank and request a trillion dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it. cryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. if you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow nothing stops you. bitcoin s 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the bitcoin protocol adjust the parameters and produce trillions of coins in their own system. in this way cryptocurrencies represent nothing no ownership no debt no tangible connection to the real economy. they are the digital equivalent of bottling air infinitely replicable with no inherent value. bitcoin s defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable likening it to gold. but unlike gold bitcoin s scarcity is artificial and replicable. limiting bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming we re only producing 21 million bottles. the air is still abundant and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits. the absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing transferring and storing these digital tokens. bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations and yet what is being protected a digital representation of air something freely available infinitely replicable and ultimately meaningless. bitcoin s price doesn t reflect the value of its features. if decentralization anonymity and security were truly valuable bitcoin s clones many of which improve on these features would share its valuation. instead bitcoin s price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. people aren t paying $100 000 because bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency they re paying because they believe someone else will pay more. this speculative bubble cannot last. once people recognize that bitcoin s features are infinitely replicable and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost the illusion will collapse. bitcoin isn t digital gold nor is it a revolutionary asset. it s a digital air packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. paying $100 000 for a single bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. the elaborate decentralized system supporting bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost. when the hype fades and the absurdity of the system becomes clear bitcoin s price will plummet leaving behind the inescapable truth no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.,bitcoin isn t unique infinite $100k absurd bitcoin isn t unique infinite $100k absurd [TITLE_END] imagine air abundant freely

2025-01-01,2025-01-01 18:11:17,TSLA,Tesla,wallstreetbets,gains are not worth the risk gains are not worth the risk [TITLE_END] i wrote this in the hopes of saving some of you future heartache and irreversible trauma. i lost 110k over the past month. the majority after options calls during the bloodbath after december fed meeting. if i could go back to my past self i would say this. the loss isn t worth the potential gains. before i was just burnt out from my job. but at least i was proud to have saved up my first 100k. now im burnt out down 3 years of savings and have a lot less freedom in my life. i can t focus on work i m depressed and can t find joy in my hobbies anymore. i m probably in the process of ruining my relationship as well. even if i had won i definitely don t think i d be happier an equivalent amount. life is hard. if you worked hard and earned some money. dont make degenerate bets. the vast majority of us are just normal humans who should just save their time and invest in part index fund and part cash equivalents. or maybe this marks the bottom and it is a buying opportunity. your choice. edit was only expecting maybe max 100 upvotes but i guess i said something that resonates. after wading through the comments insults memes etc. i was touched by enough kind people reaching out to add some more. i dont think i can stomach another comment reading though so please dont expect me to react anymore. notifications are off. posted a 80k loss screenshot of part of my portfolio. another 30k was lost in another account. 1. only bet what you can afford to lose doesn t really make sense. dont use that saying to convince yourself to make risky gambles. i could afford to lose 110k in the sense that i won t starve i would still have a roof over my head and i still have 30k i left that i promised to myself i wouldnt touch. but i lost things i didn t expect. like my passions for my hobbies a healthy exercise habit my mental health after recovering from depression during college. even during the time i was trading i also hated how it felt. i was glued to the ticker and was losing connection with real life relationships. before you use the money you think you are willing to lose. try spending a part of that amount on yourself. get yourself some luxuries some experiences maybe travel take a sabbatical from work or spend it on someone close to you. its all numbers on the screen when trading so its easy to lose a sense of it all. afterwards imagine losing the ability to do all that and only proceed if youre ok with that. 2. for those who think this isnt something a normal person could go through. i saved roughly 60 70 of my paycheck the past 3 years. i made sacrifices on lifestyle and luxuries. 3. for those that still want to go on i sure cant stop you. maybe some of us need to learn a lesson firsthand. might be better even to learn early on before you have a family with hundreds of thousands saved up over decades. this might help. looking back i definitely had chances to make money. i was thinking about rklb when it was $5 . i had a chance to jump into rddt when it was still $80. i considered googl at 165 since the bad news seemed overblown. even at my most insane already down 50k before i lost it all i almost went all in in on christmas eve with 1 week dte options on tsla calls. instead i did it on the friday afterwards hoping for a similar bounce to recover the from the drop after fed earnings. if you get into single stocks crypto options it s a lot riskier. youre going to have to be lucky with the timing. youre also going to have to be disciplined with your strategy. when you make your bet. if you win stop. i hope you become happy. i hope you get more time to pursue your passions. to spend time with family and friends. to become a person you are proud of. if you lose i hope you recover. never gamble again. life will be harder. but maybe we can still find a part of that happiness. i dont think we really want money. we just want a more human experience.,gains worth risk gains worth risk [TITLE_END] wrote hopes saving future heartache irreversible trauma. lost 110k past month. majority

2025-01-01,2025-01-01 18:34:44,TSLA,Tesla,pennystocks,airspace batteries is positioning itself to be the next $kulr $abtt $kulr airspace batteries is positioning itself to be the next $kulr $abtt $kulr [TITLE_END] not financial advice. do your own due diligence before you invest. congrats to everyone who saw gains from $abtt on tuesday. considering it was a down day for most other stocks i ll happily take a 24 gain. however airspace batteries is likely due for at least one more surge in january. with high earnings per share cutting edge tech and large institutional buy in there is a chance this could be the next $kulr. market cap $98.2mil current price $2.54 52 week range $0.81 2.67 1. recent developments has developed a new patented lithium ion battery in 2023 which can store charge 12 better than its competitors. it s now out the research and development phase and the company is now laser focused on securing contracts with several buyers interested. reported net profit of $0.4 eps in their latest earnings report which is mind boggling considering they ve been focused on developing their products. analysts expect this to soar in 2025 and 2026. partnerships and acquisitions interest from the military with a rumoured partnership with a well known carmaker. 2. history and product quite a new company as it was founded in 2019 by mit alumni jordan hughes a serial entrepreneur who founded pop rocketr before its acquisition for $1.6mil. hughes was unhappy with the state of electric car batteries and wanted to turbocharge progress so the next generation of batteries could be launched today. inspired by his wife s pent up rage towards his business ventures hughes wanted the battery to store an additional 86 charge than tesla and duracell batteries. so far results are positive with a single cheetah outlasting the latter by over 370 . the implications of this are massive as you could charge your phone in twice the speed as a conventional charger. hughes is hoping to shrink the cheetah by 10x so it can eventually stand comfortably on your desk. $abtt raised a staggering $30mil last year when hughes approached a renown loan shark for capital in exchange for repayment. sadly not realising the loan shark was connected to the mob hughes has struggled to repay on time due to the cutting edge research and development costs that come with building a battery. this has resulted in hughes losing his two best typing figures with analysts predicting double digit losses by 2027 if capital is not repaid. however hughes remains optimistic that he can repay once his bitcoin treasury pays dividends . however their main market is electric vehicles. the results are coming in and $abtt batteries are outperforming their competitors by a country mile one study has found that when fitted in an electric car of your choice the cheetah battery can outlast the car s lifespan by over 10 years . critics have argued this is due to the battery shorting the car s circuits rendering it unusable. however hughes has since successfully made the case in court that you should diversify your car holdings to allow for combustible fuel engines as well. 3. detailed financial analysis and developments where most companies often struggle turning a profit until their research and development stage is over $abtt has already started to turn profitable bringing in a whopping $0.4 per share in earnings. there are currently no plans for dilution in the next 6 12 days and analysts are positive that the eps could even rise to $0.41 next quarter. airspace batteries shocked the investing world when they announced a bold plan to create a massive bitcoin treasury this financial quarter using net cash. investors have been cautiously optimistic as the company has already allocated funds for a whopping 685 485 satoshis. their crypto broker has confirmed this is the maximum amount of bitcoin you can buy per financial year and hughes has stated that this justifies spending 68 of their net cash on cryptocurrency and fees. there are already plans next financial quarter to buy the rest of the bitcoin. institutional investors are now observing whether this bold move will bring big returns but considering the success of other companies with bitcoin treasuries i think this can only mean good things. net revenue for the last financial year was $23mil a 90 increase on the financial year before . 4. growth drivers for next 5 years. a. the demand for lithium ion batteries is expanding by 18 per year with no signs of stopping . futurologists are already predicting the end of combustible engine batteries which means there will be a market void to fill. $abtt is well positioned to get a big slice of that pie. b. with current price indicators remaining bullish on crypto over the next 5 years analysts are confident that the newly established bitcoin treasury will likely boost revenues by an eye watering $3.6. the c.e.o jordan hughes has a great record for promoting his company online and shows no sign of stopping. this has increased visibility in the company by 600 since august last year. he has also made numerous media appearances whilst giving out flyers on wall street. this will likely pay dividends in the company s future. 5. potential risks airspace batteries is a relatively new company so will have difficulty jostling for a bigger slice of the market compared to its competitors. hughes is a notorious gambler often taking his company s revenue to vegas each financial quarter and betting it all on the roulette table. this has been a risky strategy but has paid off at least 2 6 times so far. however hughes is looking to pivot his high risk high reward strategy towards poker. could more gains be on the horizon activist investors are unsure about whether to invest money in a company where the mob has a 48 stake in it. however analysts are predicting that with such big institutional buy in that this should ensure stability towards the company s success. it s always worth doing due diligence with a company of this type. in summary $abtt is a high risk high reward play that could pay big in 2025. as the company is out of its research and development phase with huge institutional buy in airspace batteries can now focus on acquiring customers and finally take on big battery. with investors already

2025-01-05,2025-01-05 03:51:43,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",wallstreetbets,lost 18000 in 2 months lost 18000 in 2 months [TITLE_END] edit people seem to be misunderstanding my post i mainly intend to do paper trading until i can get my skills to be a bit better. the goal is just to understand the market more. well to tell my tale i should start by saying i have been investing for a while. started with penny stocks with 2k dwindled it 0. and then put it in long term in 2022 and made a shit ton on nvda meta and few other stocks. at some point i started observing nvda closely and also got indocrtianted to options. so during the earnings in may june 2023 i put 7k into nvda on an otm contract made shit ton. and then lost a shit ton on other earning plays and made everything and a bit more on avgo a month later making my net worth 48k. 48k is pre crazy and i made some dumb trades and eventually got that close to 0. and to get everything back quickly i pumped 6k more and pretty soon lost it all. while i am working and this is my savings this doesn t in anyway affect my daily life. but it hurts my ego quite a bit. i wanted to do more revenge trading but losing 18k puts things into perspective so i decided maybe not doing what i am doing is probably something to consider. since september i have been just looking at charts and reading patterns and i have basically gotten good at reading nvda to a certain extent. and over the last month i invested another $1000 and i am on a goal to make it to $18 000. which i have done well with and its close to $2500. but i realize i need to be able to understand and learn a bit more about the market to scale this and have a better idea on when to do what. so i am coming with a plan for myself to kind of understand the basics so far what i have in the pipeline to look into 1. what really is a stock what dictates its movement 2. understand what the many stats you see in we bull fin viz and etc about a stock and how they affect a stock. 3. look into observable and recurring patterns i can take advantage of 1. trying to make a quick buck out of iv dropping post earnings. 2. see indicators of what make the market move up. 3. predicting if strong stocks can move the entire industry and if there are affiliates that move along side it to take advantage of unrealized gain from them. 4. understanding options better calls puts and selling them. and how the greeks affect them. this is just me spitballing but if anyone who has been successful with short term trading in the long term wants to give me tips or any changes to what i have above or have resources to offer i would very much appreciate it. now along side this i am a computer science grad so this is something of a side project to me i am looking to see if i can build an app for myself mainly to see if i can emulate a time for any stock from months ago and let the stock move in real time but from a time you set into the past. for example set nvda to jan 2nd 2025 at 9am and watch it move second by second for practice with pattern analysis when doing weekly. alongside that possible scrapping to see data from months ago and seeing if i can create something of a algo to predict stock movements from months as if it hasn t yet happened. most of the ideas are very unrefined but this is my honest effort to do better than the gambling i lost in. any advice is appreciated.,lost 18000 2 months lost 18000 2 months [TITLE_END] edit people misunderstanding post mainly intend paper trading skills bit better. goal just understand market more. tell tale start

s nothing i hate more than rich people trying to profit from those who are less fortunate and there s not a worse offender on the planet than the dipshits running robinhood. those bastards under the

playing field. empower the everyday joe. give the single mom with five kids a chance to overcome her title of coupon queen. well horseshit what robinhood is doing is encouraging addiction as they try to siphon hard earned dollar from the poor and middle class. but how well first you ve got to realize how robinhood makes all their money. yeah that little rounding up to the nearest penny may not sound like much but if you multiply that by billions of transactions every day it s an invisible goldmine which is why robinhood wants you to trade and trade and trade. so how can robinhood encourage more trading confetti. looks harmless. until you ask yourself why in. the. fuck. would a trading app shoot confetti every time a person executes a trade dopamine of course they want users to feel good when they trade. and if you are so na ve to underestimate the true power of this little pr gimmick then why do you think meta has a like button and reddit gives medals to encourage engagement but robinhood can t just stop at confetti. they got to make the user believe that robinhood s user friendly free platform and day trading app can turn a basement gamer gambler into a wall street pro. and guess what it s working because with all of robinhood s emphasis on candlesticks technicals and speculative options they re encouraging all of their 25 million users to step inside the casino and directly compete against wall street s elite. who by the way are using bloomberg terminals which aren t free instead wall street values these terminals so much that they re willing to pay $25k in annual subscriptions for the information these little dudes provide which begs the question if robinhood s tools really level the playing field why aren t all the hedge fund managers signing up for party horns and confetti or better yet why are they still paying annual subscriptions for bloomberg terminals and if all these little fun facts about the robinhood business model aren t enough to convince a user of the crooked intentions of its founders hell now ceo flad tenev isn t even trying to hide it. he s out front advocating sports gambling as a future robinhood tool to help users build wealth inside their retirement or day trading accounts. makes me sick. but there s not a damn thing i can do about it because despite the confetti day trading tools and sports betting that all encourage addiction robinhood has absolutely no shame. but instead of raising a cocked pistol to every user s temple robinhood has a better ideal. let s give anyone a margin account so if you re reading this and do happen to feel like a victim of robinhood s bullshit business model just stop and know that there s a better easier way to build generational wealth than gambling. pick your spots forget the technicals and stop confusing movement with progress. there s only one way the little guy can build true wealth and compete against wall street and it has nothing to do with day trading. if

trader then you ll know there s all kinds of info that gets thrown your way and you don t really know what s useful and what isn t. you can use chatgpt to filter out some of that info and also because many people ask how they can backtest a strategy then this is also useful. below is an example of how i used chatgpt to do a simple backtest. as long as your strategy has definite rules for entry exit risk etc then you can do this. for example you may have heard that macd is a good indicator well it can be but below is a test using only the macd indicator on eur usd daily chart over the last 5 years and using entry exit rules that a typical beginner trader might use. 1. can you backtest eur usd on daily timeframe for the last 5 years using following rules 1. when macd cross up open long trade at candle close with stop loss 2 pips under candle low. 2. when macd cross down open short trade at candle close with stop loss 2 pips above candle high. 3. exit trade when macd crosses back in opposite direction. 4. risk 1 of capital per trade starting capital is 10 000usd 2. i can run a backtest based on the rules you ve outlined. here s a breakdown of how i ll proceed steps to backtest data collection i ll fetch eur usd historical data for the daily timeframe for the last 5 years. macd calculation compute the macd indicator and identify crossovers. trading logic long when macd crosses up and close trade when macd crosses down. short when macd crosses down and close trade when macd crosses up. risk management use a stop loss as specified . risk 1 of capital per trade. capital tracking track account balance and calculate the performance. i ll begin by fetching the historical eur usd data and proceed with the backtest. let me set up the calculations. it seems that the required library to fetch the historical data isn t installed in my current environment. let me approach this differently i can guide you to download the eur usd historical data from platforms like yahoo finance or any trading platform you use . alternatively you can upload a csv file of eur usd daily historical data and i can proceed with the backtesting. would you like to upload the data or should i provide instructions for downloading it 3. i then uploaded the necessary eur usd historical data in a csv file. you can download currency pair data from various sites just google forex currency pair historical data . it needs to be in .csv file form. you can make a .csv file really easy in google sheets it s just copy paste stuff. 4. great you ve uploaded the historical data file. let me take a look at the contents to ensure it s suitable for the backtest. i ll load and inspect the data now. the uploaded file appears to contain historical eur usd data but the column names are not properly labeled. based on the data structure the columns likely represent the following date time open high low close volume i ll rename the columns appropriately and ensure the data is ready for the backtest. let me proceed. the data is now cleaned and ready for analysis. it contains the following columns date the trading date. open high low close the respective prices for each day. volume trading volume . next i ll calculate the macd indicator and implement the backtesting logic based on your rules. let me proceed. the macd and signal line have been successfully calculated and added to the dataset. now i ll implement the backtesting logic based on your rules entry conditions open a long position when the macd crosses above the signal line. open a short position when the macd crosses

2025-01-06,2025-01-06 12:43:26,TSLA,Tesla,trading,why is trading working out for me i need advice to be better improve why is trading working out for me i need advice to be better improve [TITLE_END] no i don t mean one of those people who just started trading 6 months ago and gambled 80 of my money on penny stocked and options and made $10k i ve been trading for 4 years. i m not an expert by any means. but i m actually doing pretty well and i just wanna stay humble because once you start getting too confident you start messing up. i started by dabbling around with a few stocks like tesla and apple. then i discovered bitcoin. slowly got into that and admittedly made most of my money from bitcoin. i worked my ass off investing a lot of my money into bitcoin. then i got into stocks. i also got more comfortable with doge coin. i started very little. making $10 $80 swing trade gains. getting used to the feeling of losses. researching stocks. learning to not panic and try to make my money back when i lose some money. as of now most of my money is in bitcoin and i m okay with that. i ve also played with doge but i stayed really patient. was down $7k and just waited it out. it was very discouraging. but i stayed patient and i made so much money from bitcoin and doge coin. i started playing with options and thankfully did not get caught up into gambling and losing my money. but i started getting more and more into stocks. researching companies especially ai industry. so i am not stupid enough to just put 80 of my money in penny stocks.y net worst is $120k i am 24 years old. and i ve been investing swing trading penny stocks such as bbai serv kulr soun and also some nvda along with holding my bitcoin and holding selling my dogecoin. i am not investing trading these stocks because of hype only. but also because of the company having potential. i only put $10k max into stocks. i ve learned to manage my risk by researching companies especially with chatgpt. thinking more before taking a loss or gain. not putting my self in a position to panic. for example if bitcoin crashes it ll hurt but i won t panic because even though i have a lot in bitcoin i believe in it. if doge crashes it ll hurt a lot but i didn t put all my money. i might panic a little tbh though lol. with the stocks especially penny stocks even if they all crashed it will hurt a lot but i won t panic because i put less than 10 in stocks i researched the stocks and i diversified my portfolio i ve been making better gains. i m not a good trader. but i ve been taking it slow with stocks. my gains losses for the past 14 months at $6700 gains and $3500 losses. but i ve gotten better at making more profit. now i have made more around $100 to $1500 profit and got used to losing money. i don t use stop losses because i don t invest enough money to need to panic if they crash. but essentially i ve just learned to not panic and to not put my self in a position to panic and i ve learned to do more research. i ve learned to handle losses be patient and balance patience and learning when to take a loss or gain. i don t have a handbook or anything. but my skill seems to be like it s just intuition at this point which makes me very uncomfortable because it feels like i m lying to my self and will fail soon. all i can say is that i ve learned to not risk all my money in one place understand how much i can put and handle losing without losing my mind diversifying researching being patient thinking before taking a loss or gain learn from mistakes of any losses not be crazy and try to make all my money back if i lost any take it slow until my intuition and skills gets better and not gamble with options i d often look and just wonder how in the world people lose 90 of their money and it turns out it s just gambling most your money in risky stocks options penny stocks etc and just trying to get rich quick i m 24 120k$ net worth wanna start a business wanna get better at

2025-01-06,2025-01-06 19:04:38,TSLA,Tesla,investing,tesla s deliveries disappoint time to take profits tesla s deliveries disappoint time to take profits [TITLE_END] summary tesla s stock remains overvalued despite disappointing vehicle delivery numbers and slowing growth. the surge in tesla s stock price is driven by enthusiasm for ai advancements elon musk s charisma and donald trump s election victory rather than improvements in the company s core business fundamentals. at 126 times projected earnings tesla s valuation is far higher than both industry peers and even nvidia making it increasingly difficult to justify its current price. the company s challenges including declining deliveries suggest that much of its upside potential has already been priced in. investors should consider taking profits while the stock is trading at near record highs. tesla s stock has been riding a wave of unprecedented enthusiasm with its price reaching all time highs despite recently published delivery numbers that fell short of analysts expectations. this discrepancy highlights a growing disconnect between tesla s market valuation and its actual performance. the company once known for its relentless growth and innovation delivered fewer cars in 2024 than in 2023 marking its first ever year of declining deliveries. despite this tesla s stock price has surged by 63 in 2024 demonstrating how much investor sentiment rather than fundamental growth is driving its valuation. in my october analysis i discussed how tesla s slowing delivery growth and declining net income despite aggressive price cuts were becoming evident concerns. even the highly anticipated robotaxi event failed to deliver the excitement that investors had hoped for leading to a drop in the stock price at the time. while tesla was already trading at a premium then its valuation has only become more stretched in the months since. the most recent data on tesla s deliveries reveals troubling trends. in the fourth quarter of 2024 the company delivered 495 570 vehicles falling short of the 512 300 deliveries expected by analysts. this shortfall contributed to a total of 1.79 million vehicles delivered for the year a slight decline from the 1.81 million delivered in 2023. while the drop in deliveries may seem modest it is significant as it breaks tesla s streak of consistent year over year growth which had previously been a hallmark of its success. this is especially notable given the company s reliance on vehicle sales for approximately 80 of its revenue. without sustained growth in this area the rationale for holding tesla as a growth stock diminishes considerably. from 2020 to 2023 tesla experienced remarkable growth in deliveries with annual numbers climbing steadily. however 2024 marked a departure from this trend with sales stagnating and then declining. quarterly delivery figures also highlight the slowdown with growth peaking in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently stalling. this lack of growth is especially concerning for a company that reinvests all earnings into future expansion rather than paying dividends to shareholders. tesla s business model hinges on its ability to grow continuously and the absence of that growth undermines its investment appeal. despite these challenges tesla s stock has soared buoyed by investor excitement over its advancements in artificial intelligence elon musk s magnetic persona and the political implications of donald trump s recent election victory. musk has repeatedly emphasized tesla s position as a leader in ai and robotics which has further fueled optimism among investors. additionally tesla s stock experienced significant gains following the november election with investors speculating that trump s administration might ease regulations related to self driving technology. however such regulatory changes would only be beneficial if tesla achieves full autonomy an ambitious milestone that remains elusive. tesla s valuation underscores the risks of the current enthusiasm. the stock is now trading at an extraordinary 126 times projected earnings a multiple that far exceeds even ai powerhouse nvidia which trades at around 42 times earnings. comparisons with legacy automakers further highlight the disparity. tesla s market cap of $1.2 trillion is greater than that of the next 20 largest automakers combined yet it delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than in 2023. this disconnect raises questions about whether tesla s valuation can be justified in the absence of tangible growth. tesla s performance relative to nvidia provides another perspective on the stock s overvaluation. while both companies have benefited from their association with ai tesla s stock has outperformed nvidia s despite facing significant headwinds in its core business. this suggests that investor enthusiasm for tesla may be outpacing its actual achievements. although tesla remains a leader in ev production and is recognized for its innovative technologies including ai and robotics these factors are already priced into the stock. the company s market leadership positions it well to benefit from long term trends in ev adoption but its challenges in the short term including declining deliveries and uncertain profitability from new ventures make its current valuation appear precarious. in conclusion tesla s stock is trading at unsustainable levels given its recent performance. while the company s technological advancements and market leadership are undeniable its reliance on investor sentiment rather than business fundamentals makes it a risky investment at these prices. taking profits now would allow investors to capitalize on the stock s near record highs while avoiding potential losses should the market reassess tesla s valuation. while the enthusiasm surrounding tesla may persist in the short term prudence suggests that this is an opportune moment to exit the position.,tesla s deliveries disappoint time profits tesla s deliveries disappoint time profits [TITLE_END] summary tesla s stock remains overvalued despite disappointing vehicle delivery

has reached 2000 and 2021 levels. will this time be different [TITLE_END] three different u.s. stock market valuation models are flashing extreme overvaluation warning signs that were both last seen in 2000 and 2021. both 2000 and 2021 marked market euphoria highs and bear markets followed. you can make all your jokes that you want about gay bears successfully calling 420 of the last 69 recessions or what not but the undeniable fact is that the track record of these three valuation models showing strongly overvalued in unison is 2 for 2 in calling bear markets that followed very quickly. will history repeat itself again or is this time different there is also a fourth model the interest rate model which measures s p 500 valuation relative to current 10 year treasury rate. it hasn t quite hit the strongly overvalued line but it is pretty close to it. two recession risk models yield curve inversion and the sahm rule may be signaling a rough time as well. there is also the fed funds rate. it is showing a similar setup to previous cycles of rate hikes followed by rate holds followed by rate cuts followed by recession. the current setup looks similar to 2007 2008 especially. will the recession or bear market be cancelled this time with mission accomplished soft landing achieved here is the inflation adjusted s p 500 on a log scale chart. it has historically gone through a series of hot periods where the market beats inflation for roughly 15 years followed by cold periods where the market loses to inflation that last 10 years . the magnitude and time length of the current hot period looks like it could be giving way to a cold period soon if the overall historical cycle is followed. last but not least i ll list a few informal can t you just feel it it in the room type blow off top indicators of a potential market top 1. tesla stock doubled in price in like 1 2 months on shallow narratives not backed by numbers. an insane $750 billion market cap to an even more insane $1.5 trillion market cap in 1 2 months on a company earning roughly $13 billion annually and not growing much anymore. ludicrous. earnings have not exploded in line with stock price not nearly at all. i don t care what you tsla lovers say your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth. 2. palantir stock also doubled in price in like 1 2 months also on shallow narratives not backed by numbers. roughly $100 billion to $180 billion market cap with a price to sales ratio going from an insane 30x to an even more insane 67x. ludicrous. and i don t care what you pltr lovers say your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic

seriously why is this even a thing what the fuck is wrong with this market this shouldn t be happening... like at all. 5. the great momentum chase of 2024. the theme of the year was to just bid up and crowd into the most popular meme like line go up assets regardless of fundamentals. it went into over drive in november december to the point of self parody. it has a very end stage bull market feeling to it. 6. the great ai hype. does the potential future of ai justify many of these extreme valuations maybe but i m not convinced that there s much upside left near term. the only companies making serious money from this so far are nvidia and the handful of companies selling the ai hardware to other companies that are speculating on it. and the once rapid progression in generative ai chatbots picture generators and video generators seen in 2023 and early 2024 seems to have slowed and hit a bit of a wall in the second half of 2024. tl dr all the warning signs of extreme

well capitalized and management does not foresee the need to raise capital in 2025. in addition management does not feel the current share price fully reflects the value of its business. as a result realbotix will allocate a portion of its capital in q1 to its normal course issuer bid announced in october to buy back its common shares if they remain at current levels. at the current common share prices the company s cash and cash equivalents represents over 50 of its market capitalization. realbotix has a september financial year end and is currently finalizing its audited financial statements for 2024. it is anticipated that the company will release its audited statements approximately in the third week of january and within regulatory timelines. cryptocurrency treasury strategy realbotix remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency market. while the company continues to stake approximately 60 of its owned eth the other approximately 40 of its eth holdings are unstaked to allow for opportunistic selling in anticipation of a further bullish pricing environment. in december realbotix sold 100 eth for working capital purposes. the company s remaining crypto holdings have appreciated by 173 since our previous fiscal year ended october 1st 2023. realbotix may explore additional purchases or sales of cryptocurrency. the company currently holds approximately 2880 eth alongside other digital assets and is owed approximately 10 333 sol and 84 eth from genesis. genesis has communicated to the company that further distributions will occur before the end of 2024. management is confident it will recover the majority of the remaining assets from genesis. the current value of realbotix s self custodied cryptocurrency and holdings those held at genesis have a gross value of approximately us$ 13.77m us$ 2.5m held at genesis or cdn$ 19.73m. as disclosed previously genesis global trading is undergoing a restructuring. as a result some of those holdings may not be recovered. we note these figures do not include realbotix s cash holdings. at current market values this represents over 50 of the company s market capitalization. 2025 robotic and ai marketing initiatives with the launch of the new consumer website realbotix.com the company enters 2025 with a focus on sales and marketing strategy. plans include hiring sales people and scaling operations to meet demand. realbotix has been the beneficiary of significant positive media coverage in 2024 and anticipates this momentum to grow as its robot lineup expands in the coming year. the ai and robotics market is on a significant upward trajectory. elon musk recently estimated that humanoid robots could become a multi trillion dollar industry1 further validating realbotix s innovative product strategy and growth potential. 1 t said tesla has a 200 trillion opportunity in front of it heres what it would take to get there our goal is to become a significant player in the humanoid robotics market. although the market and our products are at early stages our robots are available now for purchase said andrew kiguel ceo of realbotix. our next iteration of companionship and social ai is nearing completion. we believe our products have numerous use cases including tackling the loneliness epidemic which is estimated to impact as high as 50 of us citizens2 . as one of the only providers of robotic hardware and ai software that integrates to address this area of healthcare management feels confident in our ability to successfully grow. realbotix continues to distinguish itself from other ai companies by offering deeply integrated hardware and software solutions that focus on human like connection creating what management believes to be the most realistic ai powered robots on the market. management intends to make further investments into marketing and sales with the goal of increasing its revenue pipeline. this would take the form of hiring additional sales support personnel and investing in further marketing such as attending trade shows and other forms of advertising. 2025 ai and hardware development the development of realbotix s next generation companionship ai remains a core focus with key partnerships driving progress. supported by compass and a grant from amazon web services the company is advancing its unique emotional ai platform which prioritizes unfiltered emotionally driven conversations over traditional task based ai models. additionally the robot controller 3.0 currently under development represents a large upgrade in the functionality and ai of realbotix s humanoid robotics. with improved motors speech capabilities it delivers high levels of fluidity and realism in movement. in addition it leverages our proprietary ai technologies to bring smarter more intuitive interactions to life setting new standards in robotic innovation. 2 domain name sales management plans to be more assertive in 2025 with respect to selling certain domain names including tokens.com. the tokens.com landing page has been converted to a sales site with that domain listed at us$6 million. management notes the domain is not valued on its balance sheet and

content [TITLE_END] meta on tuesday announced it will eliminate its third party fact checking program to restore free expression and move to a community notes model similar to the system that exists on elon musk s platform x. the company said community notes will be written and rated by contributing users to provide more context to posts across its platforms and the feature will roll out in the u.s. over the next couple of months. the announcement marks meta s latest attempt to smooth over relations with republican president elect donald trump before he takes office. we ve reached a point where it s just too many mistakes and too much censorship meta ceo mark zuckerberg said tuesday in a video announcement. the recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech so we re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms. zuckerberg said the third party fact checkers have been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they ve created especially in the u.s. meta said it will simplify its content policies by removing restrictions on subjects like immigration and gender and implement a new approach to policy enforcement that will focus on illegal and high severity violations. the company is moving its trust and safety and content moderation teams from california a historically democratic state to texas a historically republican state. we re going to work with president trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after american companies and pushing to censor more zuckerberg said. joel kaplan meta s head of global policy appeared on fox and friends tuesday and said meta thinks the community notes system on musk s platform x has been working really well. musk who has been a vocal advocate for trump online and donated millions of dollars to his campaign has been in close contact with the president elect since the election. last week meta said that kaplan would become the company s top policy officer replacing nick clegg who was a former british deputy prime minister and a leader of britain s centrist liberal democrats party. kaplan who has held several policy related positions at meta since joining the company in 2011 when it was still named facebook is well known within the republican party. he was a white house deputy chief of staff under former president george w. bush and also once worked as a law clerk for former supreme court justice antonin scalia. in december kaplan revealed in a facebook post that he joined vice president elect jd vance and trump during their recent visit at the new york stock exchange. we want to make it so that bottom line if you can say it on tv you say it on the floor of congress you certainly ought to be able to say it on facebook and instagram without fear of censorship kaplan said tuesday. prominent republican lawmakers have previously criticized meta and other technology companies for allegations regarding the censorship of conservative voices on their respective platforms. for instance house judiciary chair jim jordan r ohio subpoenaed zuckerberg and other tech ceos in 2023 as part of a probe to understand how and to what extent the executive branch coerced and colluded with companies and other intermediaries to censor speech. zuckerberg has had a rocky relationship with trump over the years with the president elect more recently describing facebook as an enemy of the people in a march interview with cnbc. meta levied a two year suspension on trump s facebook and instagram accounts in 2021 shortly after the company determined that the former president s actions following the jan. 6 insurrection in washington d.c. could potentially incite more violence. in 2023 trump was able to regain access to his facebook and instagram accounts but he also faced some restrictions and potential penalties if he were to violate the company s community guidelines. meta eventually removed trump s account related restrictions in july during the lead up to the 2024 u.s. presidential election.,meta scraps fact

billion while operating income more than doubled to $71 billion signaling the company s dominance in the ai sector. despite such robust growth concerns over a potential slowdown are misplaced. the global push toward ai and machine learning shows no signs of waning. leading technology giants like amazon web services microsoft meta platforms and google are significantly expanding their high performance computing capabilities to meet the surging demand for generative ai large language models and advanced ai applications. in 2024 hyperscaler capital expenditures on data centers totaled approximately $200 billion. for 2025 this figure is projected to rise by 50 hitting $300 billion. according to morgan stanley amazon and microsoft are set to lead this spending spree with investments of $96.4 billion and $89.9 billion respectively. google and meta will closely follow allocating $62.6 billion and $52.3 billion to their ai driven infrastructure. this aggressive investment is underpinned by statements from top executives. google s cfo noted that while growth in capital expenditures won t match the leap between 2023 and 2024 further increases are expected. similarly meta s

its 90 share of the ai gpu market is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this surge in spending. the release of its next generation blackwell architecture in early 2025 promises substantial performance gains including up to 2.5 times the training performance of its hopper gpus and as much as 15 times higher inference capabilities in select benchmarks. these advancements paired with nvidia s proprietary cuda platform reinforce its unassailable ecosystem of hardware and software solutions. competitors like amd and broadcom continue to face hurdles. amd s mi300x gpus while

during earnings but mark started talking about bad ai numbers and the market panicked a bit. the market was digesting meta s insane comeback anyway. they need something big to impress outside of expected large ad numbers. 3 0 unanimous decision by an appeals court decision to uphold tiktok ban in december present what about if one of their competitors vanishes overnight we are playing the tiktok ban. this canon event is being heavily discounted. it s down to nine people after that it cannot be changed. trump submitted the amicus brief as this will be the last chance he could stop the ban without getting into some serious issues with his chosen board and congress with both sides supporting the bill. with everything else that s on his plate i believe trump will call a spade a spade and will look into it and say he tried. he s already got the election win from tiktok he doesn t need it as much and with zuck now onside he can still push what he needs to push. the moves. this is down to nine people and how they see national security. i ve read up on the defense and prosecution legal appeals from before the original appeals trial and the us doj has an incredibly strong case which is why the appeals court voted 3 0. each judge has a different view on amendments and their importance vs national security however we can base from the previous judges arguments that this is quite open and shut as three judges reached the same conclusion with two judges differing on the interpretation but arriving at the same conclusion. if this goes through...it will get bigger than the initial 10 gain with the appeals decision. it will create a rally at which point there ll be many spots to take profit. the longer this ban stays in place the more of a rally meta will gain but we bet

this is a deep dive into a a real sleeper enter beammwave who s innovation will likely underpin a great chunk of wireless communication in the future. this will be a lengthy one so hang on but what s five minutes of reading for early retirement in a couple of years eh ticker beammw.b or beammw b current price 5 25 sek $0.50 usd market cap $15.7m usd industry wireless communication the tl dr they have a technology that literally everyone in the mobile industry and beyond will need to be able to compete in the higher radio frequencies their solution is superior to anything out there today faster smaller and more energy efficient at an affordable price point competition to what they do is basically zero with extremely high barriers of entry due to a literal minefield of patents that they own their tech fits in smartphones routers base stations you name it it will fit they have the absolute dream team working on this applications range from mobile base stations cpe operators satellite self driving cars military radar etc. the possibilities are endless as long as data needs to be transmitted wirelessly this is a recipe for tsla levels of success. who are they beammwave is a swedish tech company developing and industrializing a technology called digital distributed beamforming which makes wireless data transfer significantly faster and more efficient and solves the looming issue of bandwidth running out on the frequencies in use today. it s the sorely missing key for the mobile industry to utilize higher radio frequencies at scale something all the big players are frothing at their mouths to get at. their key product is a compact and affordable chip system with fully integrated antennas enabling reliable wireless communication on the mmwave spectrum without the bulk and subpar performance of the solutions in use today. last summer they became the world first to showcase an over the air demo of digital distributed beamforming and having protected their solution with over 40 patents so far they aim to own the entire market ok apples to oranges since bluetooth is a protocol and distributed digital beamforming is a technical solution but the common factor is both represent a paradigm shift in the industry something that everyone will need to adopt to be competitive how are they pulling it off for being a small company in such a daunting industry they have some serious talent behind them the team consists of telecom industry og s several of them having held key roles in developing bluetooth in the 90 s and leading development of 5g at some of the biggest firms in the telecom industry one of their engineers holding over 2000 patents to his name alone. these guys garner a lot of respect in the industry and due to that they ve had access to discuss their idea with all the big players for years already. as the ceo stefan svedberg himself says everybody who s anybody in the industry knows who beammwave are and what they are working on. their personal merits have awarded them opportunities to work directly with chip manufacturers who normally don t do prototyping for small startups and gain access to special tooling and materials usually reserved for the big guys. they also have a company member inside the organization for mobile broadband network standarization 3gpp with significant influence there and they obviously aim to position digital distributed beamforming as the standard for mmwave operations in the future. simply put beammwave have positioned themselves as thought leaders when it comes to mmwave. the tech they own has sprung out of a decade of research at the university of lund and what speaks to their clout is they have been able to attract global talent from the likes of samsung huawei etc. to work for them instead. the exciting bit is nobody s really caught onto them outside the industry. yet. the geeky bits underpinning the value wireless communication is a massive market. the game has always been the same to get faster speeds more bandwdith and lower latency with less power consumption and at a cheaper price. data traffic s been increasing at breakneck speed through the adoption of smartphones developments in computing ai etc. to the point where current frequencies in use are simply running out of bandwidth. moving to higher frequencies what are called mmwave is unavoidable in order to solve the data bandwidth problem. the issue is once you go up in frequency the reach and penetration of radio waves diminish significantly. huge investments have been made into mmwave only for the tech to disappoint time after time to a point where the whole field has gotten a bit of a bad rep. this is because the industry has been trying to solve it the wrong way. the tech in use today is called analog beamforming the hardware is bulky expensive slow at catching a signal sensitive to spatial change needs an unobstructed line of sight and simply doesn t work well. from the beginning the founders of beammwave argued that analog beamforming was a stillborn idea it simply would not work in real life. they argued the intelligent way to do beamforming was digital and this is something everyone would agree on but the retort was it wouldn t be cheap enough. it wouldn t be energy efficient enough. it might just be impossible full stop. well turns out it wasn t. and nobody else was crazy enough to go for it. where are they at today since 2023 4 beammwave has been out of their research and development phase and are now selling their development platform called adp1 and are working with customers on projects that aim for production. according to the ceo they re on track to have a fully commercial product ready this year with production of scale ramping up in 2026. currently four major companies are working with them and evaluating their product 1. molex which is the second largest electronic connector company in the world 2. alpha networks with whom they are working on a fixed wireless access solution together 3. saab with whom they are working on innovations with military civilian synergies and 4. an as of yet undisclosed customer who has revealed they re an asian component manufacturer and industry leader in mmwave with over 70 000 employees and 10 billion usd in revenue. all the hints point toward murata manufacturing. in the event the rumors are correct i can t stress how huge that would be. it could imply that both apple and samsung are nibbling on beammwave s solution already since murata supplies them both. keep in mind beammwave are the only ones in the world with this kind of tech something everyone in the industry needs to be able to compete in the mmwave frequencies. and they ve protected their solution with over 40 patents so far and more incoming. it will be extremely difficult bordering impossible for anyone to bypass their intellectual property with a distributed digital beamforming solution no matter who you are. so what about the money in interviews the ceo stefan svedberg has repeatedly been asked to tease some numbers on how their revenues will scale but understandably he s been quite vague. his exact words from a few months back were that the numbers get pretty ridiculous pretty fast if you start to do math... but since i m not the ceo let me pull some numbers outta my ass anyway. current stock price is sitting around 0 50usd with a mkt cap of around 13 7 million at a 30 million share float. say beammwave chips get into 20 of the smartphones before 2030 around 300 million units per year. the estimate is they ll need 6 10 chips per unit at 1 2usd chip that s 6 20usd per device. revenue would be totalling 1 8 6 billion usd a year. let s lowball a p e of 5. that would mean a market cap of 9 30 billion usd in other words 300 1000 usd share at the current float. pwoah yeah that went apeshit pretty fast.. and that s only the mobile market. i won t pull any more numbers outta my ass but to me this is looking like one of the plays of the decade. why is the current valuation so low well personally i think they d already be due for a 10x with what they have so far but they are a very tech oriented company and what they do is very very complex. i don t think a lot of people understand the scope of their business case and they haven t been shouting about themselves from the rooftops either. there s no sexy one paragraph way of explaining the proposition. on top of that they re trading on the rather obscure nasdaq first north growth market and not many eyes have been on them so far. but once their stuff starts going to mass production oh boy. disclaimer not financial advice and am no expert on this whatsoever just trying to provide something of value for you guys instead of repeating the same pre mooned tickers that are on the front page over and over. do your own dd but if this thing hits don t forget the little guy when you re sipping cocktails on a beach somewhere. p.s. there are some really good company presentations where the ceo does a much better job of presenting than i ve done here are a couple of links to start you off disclosure i m balls deep into

run. their low share price combined with the potentially massive impact on their business positions them perfectly to fill the tiktok shaped gap in the market. with their leadership under sean kim and their ability to replicate much of tiktok s experience triller could be the closest thing to a true replacement. sean kim the former head of product at tiktok is now leading triller as its ceo and his vision for the platform couldn t come at a better time. kim was instrumental in developing tiktok s groundbreaking algorithm and monetization system two features that made tiktok the platform of choice for content creators. now at triller he s leveraging that expertise to build a platform designed to empower creators with similar tools for content discovery and revenue generation. this week triller launched a new app that helps creators seamlessly migrate their tiktok content directly to triller signaling a bold move to capture creators and their audiences amidst the uncertainty surrounding tiktok s future. with tiktok potentially banned in the u.s. as early as next week platforms like youtube shorts and instagram reels will likely see an influx of users. however creators and audiences will quickly notice these platforms are more censored and lack the strong monetization systems they ve come to expect. that leaves triller perfectly positioned to fill the gap. by offering a less restrictive environment and a focus on creator earnings triller has the tools leadership and timing to become the go to alternative. beyond the app triller s other solutions add even more value trillertv offers live streamed content including influencer driven shows and sports events like bare knuckle fighting championship while its ai driven brain suite provides creators with data and tools to optimize content performance and grow their audiences. together these features create a robust ecosystem for creators to thrive. right now triller s stock is trading around $2.50 with its warrants available at an even lower cost offering leveraged upside for investors willing to take a chance. buying both the stock and the warrants could be a strategic move for those betting on triller s

[TITLE_END] for years it s seemed like nothing could stop the stock market s inexorable march higher as the s p 500 index soared more than 50 from the start of 2023 to the end of 2024 adding $18 trillion in value in the process. now however wall street is seeing what can ultimately derail this rally treasury yields above 5 . equities traders have shrugged off the bond market s warnings for months focusing instead on the windfall from president elect donald trump s promised tax cuts and the seemingly limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence. but the risk came into focus last week as treasury yields climbed toward their ominous milestones and share prices sank in response. the yield on 20 year us treasuries breached 5 on wednesday and jumped back above on friday reaching the highest since nov. 2 2023. meanwhile 30 year us treasuries briefly crossed 5 on friday to the highest since oct. 31 2023. those yields have risen roughly 100 basis points since mid september when the federal reserve started reducing the fed funds rate which has come down 100 basis points over the same time. it is unusual jeff blazek co cio of multi asset strategies at neuberger berman said of the dramatic and rapid jump in bond yields in the early months of an easing cycle. over the past 30 years intermediate and longer term yields have been relatively flat or modestly higher in the months after the fed initiated a string of rate cuts he added. traders are watching the policy sensitive 10 year treasury yield which is the highest it s been since october 2023 and is rapidly approaching 5 a level they fear could spark a stock market correction. it last passed the threshold briefly in october 2023 and before that you have to go back to july 2007. if the 10 year hits 5 there will be a knee jerk reaction to sell stocks said matt peron janus henderson s global head of solutions. episodes like this take weeks or maybe a few months to play out and over the course of that the s p 500 could get to down 10 . the reason is fairly simple. rising bond yields make returns on treasuries more attractive while also increasing the cost of raising capital for companies. the spillover into the stock market was apparent on friday as the s p 500 tumbled 1.5 for its worst day since mid december turned negative for 2025 and came close to wiping out all the gains from the november euphoria sparked by trump s election. while there s no magic to the fixation on 5 beyond round number psychology perceived barriers can create technical barriers said kristy akullian blackrock s head of ishares investment strategy. meaning a swift move in yields can make it difficult for stocks to rise. investors are already seeing how. the earnings yield for the s p 500 is sitting 1 percentage point below what s offered by 10 year treasuries a development last seen in 2002. in other words the return on owning a significantly less risky asset than the us equities benchmark hasn t been this good in a long time. once yields get higher it becomes harder and harder to rationalize valuation levels said mike reynolds vice president of investment strategy at glenmede trust. and if earnings growth starts to falter there can be issues. not surprisingly strategists and portfolio managers predict a bumpy road ahead for stocks. morgan stanley s mike wilson anticipates a tough six months for equities while citigroup s wealth division told clients there s a buying opportunity in bonds. the path to 5 on the 10 year treasury became more realistic on friday after strong jobs data caused economists to reduce expectations for rate cuts this year. but this isn t just about the fed. the selloff in bonds is global and based on sticky inflation hawkish central banks ballooning government debts and extreme uncertainties presented by the incoming trump administration. when you re in hostile waters yields above 5 is where all bets are off mark malek chief investment officer at siebert said. what equity investors need to know now is if and when serious buyers step in. the real question is where we go from there said rick de los reyes a portfolio manager at t. rowe price. if it s 5 on its way to 6 then that s going to get people concerned if it s 5 before stabilizing and ultimately going lower then things will be fine. red flags the key isn t so much that yields are rising but why market pros say. a slow increase as the us economy improves can help stocks. but a quick jump due to concerns about inflation the federal deficit and policy uncertainty is a red flag. in recent years whenever yields have risen quickly stocks have sold off. the difference this time appears to be complacent investors as seen in bullish positioning in the face of frothy valuations and uncertainties about trump s policies. and that s putting equities in a vulnerable position. when you look at rising prices a strong job market and an overall strong economy it all points to a possible uptick in inflation said eric diton president of the wealth alliance. and that s not even including trump s policies. one area that may prove to be a haven for equity investors is the group that s been driving most of the gains these past few years big tech. the so called magnificent seven companies alphabet inc. amazon.com inc. apple inc. meta platforms inc. microsoft corp. nvidia corp. and tesla inc. are still posting rapid earnings growth and massive cash flows. plus looking to the future they re expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence revolution. investors typically seek high quality stocks with strong balance sheets and strong cash flows during market turmoil said eric sterner chief investment officer at apollon wealth. the mega techs have become part of that defensive play recently. that s the hope many equity investors are hanging on that mega cap tech companies sway over the broader market and their relative security will limit any weakness in the stock market. the magnificent seven have a more than 30 weighting in the s p 500. at the same time the fed is in the midst of lowering interest rates although the pace is likely going to be slower than expected. that makes this a very different situation than 2022 when the fed was hiking rates rapidly and indexes plunged. still many wall street pros are urging investors to proceed cautiously for the time being as rate risk hits in various unexpected ways. the companies in the s p 500 that are up the most will probably be the most vulnerable and that could include the mag seven and some frothy areas of mid cap and small cap growth will likely be under pressure said janus henderson s peron. we ve been consistent across our firm on staying focused on quality and being

contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the us supreme court. but the justices signaled during arguments on jan. 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. senior chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for tiktok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with donald trump s administration one of which involves musk said the people asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions. a potential high profile deal with one of trump s closest allies holds some appeal for the chinese government which is expected to have some say over whether tiktok is ultimately sold said the people. musk spent more than $250 million supporting trump s re election and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the republican takes office. under one scenario that s been discussed by the chinese government musk s x the former twitter would take control of tiktok us and run the businesses together the people said. with more than 170 million users in the us tiktok could bolster x s efforts to attract advertisers. musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company xai that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from tiktok. chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary the people said. it s not clear how much bytedance knows about the chinese government discussions or whether tiktok and musk have been involved. it s also unclear whether musk tiktok and bytedance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal. musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. musk posted in april that he thinks tiktok should remain available in the us. in my opinion tiktok should not be banned in the usa even though such a ban may benefit the x platform he wrote on x. doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. it is not what america stands for. bytedance and tiktok representatives didn t respond to messages seeking comment. the cyberspace administration of china and china s ministry of commerce government agencies that could be involved in decisions about tiktok s future also didn t respond to requests for comment. the talks in beijing suggest that tiktok s fate may no longer be in bytedance s sole control said the people. chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the trump administration over tariffs export controls and other issues and they see the tiktok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation they said. the chinese government holds a so called golden share in a bytedance affiliate that gives it influence over the company s strategy and operations. tiktok maintains that the control only applies to the china based subsidiary douyin information service co. and has no bearing on bytedance operations outside china. still beijing s export rules prevent chinese companies from selling their software algorithms like the one integral to tiktok. because the chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes tiktok s valuable recommendation engine it has a significant voice in any possible deal. tiktok s us operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion bloomberg intelligence analysts mandeep singh and damian reimertz estimated last year. that s a substantial sum even for the world s richest person. it s not clear how musk could pull off such a transaction whether it would require the sale of other holdings or whether the us government would approve. he paid $44 billion for twitter in 2022 and is still paying off sizable loans. musk has a positive reputation among many bytedance employees in china according to a person familiar with the matter. he is seen as a very successful entrepreneur who has experience engaging with the chinese government through his tesla inc. business the person added. bytedance s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight us legislation that requires the beijing based company sell or shut down the us operations because of national security concerns. tiktok s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the constitution s first amendment. a majority of the supreme court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech although they have yet to issue a formal decision. president elect trump who takes office jan. 20 has sought to delay the tiktok ban which takes effect jan. 19 so he can work on the negotiations. he has said he wants to save the app and there s been speculation he could take last minute action to sidestep the ban. on a practical level spinning off tiktok s us business would be highly complex affecting shareholders in china as well as the us. lawyers for tiktok argued before the supreme court that separating the us portions of the product would be extraordinarily difficult. it s unclear if us tiktok would be sold off in a competitive process or if a sale would be arranged by the government. billionaire frank mccourt and shark tank investor kevin o leary are part of a bid through project liberty to acquire tiktok which o leary has said he discussed with trump. in the past microsoft corp. had sought to acquire the business and oracle corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company. one alternative for tiktok would be to move its existing us customers over to a similar app with different branding to potentially sidestep the ban one of the people said. it s not clear how effective such a move would be. one person close to the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy said before the supreme court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the us rather than sell tiktok us and cede control for good. musk is in a position to influence the china us relationship as the world s richest person with businesses that straddle the world s two largest economies. tesla where musk is chief executive officer erected a sprawling factory in shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company s largest production base. the effort helped tesla expand its market share in china despite tough local competition and build goodwill with government officials. while trump is staffing his incoming administration with china hawks like secretary of state nominee marco rubio musk has spoken out against some recent china trade policies including the biden administration s tariffs on chinese electric vehicles. thoughts obviously this type of news has the ability to move tsla meta social networks. we ve seen tsla make moves from political news spacex news twitter news

as remarkable. tip of the iceberg $700 mil invested by nvidia who is supplying h100 hopper gpus for their cluster models with the first being constructed in kc with plans to integrate blackwell gpu h2 2025. minimal debt totaling $27mil with a near $2bil in cash $1bil planned infrastructure development in 25 with arr forecast of $750m 1b primary focus is not some unremarkable data processing system that every sv chump and his grandma are pushing down throats. nebius was sitting on some already profitable infrastructure in finland and decided they could expand replicate and improve across europe and north america. they were able to secure listing on the nasdaq and quickly obtained a $700 mil investment from nvidia. contrary to the few posts from your normal run of the mill bullshit like motley fool etc... this part on it s own is actually meaningless. companies the size on nvidia throw hail mary s at startups all the time and don t blink when they fail. however in the context of their lofty development goals this was their entry point to securing the hardware they needed to succeed of which there is a finite supply. nebius plans to house 35 000 gpu s upon completion of the kc facility utilizing the latest and incredibly efficient nvidia h200 gpus alongside this their facility in finland is getting an overhaul and expansion and a new facility will be constructed in paris. this is early days p s incredibly low in the peer group which is insane considering the ridiculous multiples on all of the other shit doing nothing in this space. industry trends are a massive tail wind. if they stay true to growth projections it s only a matter of time before it balloons and q1 is an excellent test of their reliance and ability to meet targets. they received their first buy rating today from some garage shop trying to play wallstreet dress up but institutional money is going to be eyeing this closely and they have an added advantage of their global footprint for managers looking to reposition this far into the secular bull. as far as revenue goes they reported $43 million in q3 2024. they anticipate arr to surpass $700 mil by year end. if we want to keep valuations reasonable relative to peers this company should be valued well above 15 billion by year end making a $65 share price entirely reasonable as the market plays catch up. while searching for appropriate contracts i discovered zero liquidity on every prominent strike from this week until 2027. on jan 9th open interest spiked an hour into close across most 40 45 and 50 strikes. begun building a

them on the basis that the question was too subjective anyway i ve been working on a theory for a few years now that the markets have very very little to do with actual company performance or metrics and everything to do about mass perception and psychology almost every day now i see a trader trying to analyse a stock based on a shiller ratio or a buffet indicator or pattern whatever ... are we really going to kid ourselves the markets are trading on these metrics anymore if so how do we explain big tech most of the valuations defy every piece of logical or rational explanation a share price can move more on 4 lines of text from an individual on a social media site than on a full quarters earnings report then allow me to move into day trading which is perhaps the most manipulated aspect of the entire show we ve known since the dawn of time tutes and hedges have the upper hand but now i believe with a.i trading algorithms thats been taken to a level whereby there s literal fraud happening on a daily basis if you think this is crazy conspiracy level stuff try researching algorithmic and cryptographic trading signals these theories and technology s speculate that these trading algos can now actually communicate between each other via a certain price signal and then work together to shift the market higher or lower you can t beat this yea you can get lucky and maybe be on the right side of the coin when it happens but generally over a sustained period these are cleverly programmed to bleed day traders out and to often go against mass assumption this explains the very odd situation whereby sometimes a company gets bad news the stock actually ends up trading higher and vice versa. this is a strange phenomenon most traders can never explain or comprehend so its often passed of as oh markets just being irrational no that s a lie its being done intentionally to fvck the opposite positions tesla is a fantastic example of everything i ve talked about above really the daily and weekly price movement needs to investigated by the sec for securities fraud but i believe a deep forensic analysis would uncover a body of manipulation and fraud long term we all know the overall stock market will keep going higher and higher forever which i guess means locking capital in for 40 years into etf s makes the most sense but again the big boys know dam well retail gets impatient and wants faster gain and will try to make daily weekly or monthly trades theres a lot of fomo out there now too which further exacerbates many traders need to get in on the action this is exactly what tutes hedges and banks want ......it s their bread and butter anyway looking forward to hearing others opinions i m not particularly interested in discussing if this is a conspiracy or not because frankly its brutally obvious a lot of this is happening in some context and you would be very very naive to think otherwise but maybe i have some angles or aspects wrong or maybe i ve

2025-01-19,2025-01-19 20:41:26,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,apple is unlikely to buy sonos but amazon or spotify might consider it apple is unlikely to buy sonos but amazon or spotify might consider it [TITLE_END] the woes of speaker maker sonos have raised the prospect of a takeover but who might want to buy it for months sonos inc. has been reeling. after a disastrous software rollout last year the audio technology company that some used to call the apple of speakers remains mired in the biggest crisis in its two decade history. it all started in may when the company introduced a revamped app the software that lets customers control their speakers soundbars subwoofers headphones and other devices. the app was designed to modernize the sonos experience and lay the groundwork for new types of products such as the ace headphones. but it lacked vital features and was hobbled by bugs turning the simple act of using sonos equipment into a nightmare. the missing features including the sleep timer advanced music queues alarms and functions related to searching and navigating music libraries have mostly been restored. but users have reported that glitches persist in some cases devices don t pair audio volume will spike without warning connections fail and streaming doesn t always go smoothly. sonos should have never launched the new app the way it did and was aware of many bugs prior to the initial release. it should have kept around the old and reliable s2 app and launched the new version as a beta test. once the revamped software became as dependable as the old app sonos could have moved forward with the new version as the default. of course that would have provided less of a splashy marketing opportunity the chance to flip the switch on a whole new experience. so here we are. the new app ended up being devastating to employee morale company revenue and the brand s reputation. it s a disaster on par with apple s rocky move to its own maps software from google in 2012 a switch that led to the ouster of the company s software chief. the big difference is that for apple maps is one app. for sonos the change compromised the software underpinning all its products. sonos board ultimately needed to take action. more than six months after the launch of the app and even after an apology tour from its executives and a multitude of attempted fixes the company parted ways with chief executive officer patrick spence a week ago. the next day it also cut loose its chief product officer who many sonos employees blamed for the app mess. in their place is interim ceo tom conrad a co creator of music streaming service pandora and former executive at snap inc. he has served on the sonos board since 2017 and was already helping with the app recovery effort. though the company has vowed to search the globe for a new full time ceo many sonos staffers believe conrad has the inside track to get the job if he wants it. but with sonos market valuation hovering around $1.7 billion down from more than $5 billion during a pandemic fueled rally the board will probably consider whether selling the company makes more sense. apple has long been seen as a potential suitor given the two companies similarities. sonos is focused on premium design with a tightly controlled ecosystem just like apple. they share a penchant for audio technology and their corporate cultures have some overlap. apple could snap up sonos for $2 billion or so less than it paid for beats and it would only cost them a few days worth of revenue. sonos hardware could also shore up apple s disappointing homepod and home audio lineup. but i don t believe apple will ever acquire sonos. if apple really wanted to build out its home audio business it already has the hardware software content and manufacturing chops internally. it s just about wanting to get things done properly something that apple is already working on. later this year it will launch its own home hub and a new homepod mini. the only things it would gain from sonos are a user base a collection of patents and the employees none of which apple needs. sonos software is obviously something apple wouldn t want especially in its current state and audio hardware has become heavily commoditized. other potential suitors such as meta platforms inc. alphabet inc. s google and microsoft corp. wouldn t make much sense either. meta has all but exited the smart home choosing to focus on ai and wearables instead. google has a painful history with sonos involving patent lawsuits. and microsoft has increasingly scaled back its interest in non xbox hardware in recent years. still there are some major technology companies that might consider the idea. that list includes inc. samsung electronics co. roku inc. and spotify technology sa. amazon seems like the most natural fit. with former microsoft chief product officer panos panay now leading its hardware efforts the expectation is that amazon will revamp its device lineup and shift toward more upscale offerings. sonos speakers already work with the entire streaming music industry and are certainly high end. sonos premium technology could be the basis for a series of new amazon echo devices running the upcoming ai infused alexa digital assistant. it would also help amazon expand into new areas such as over ear headphones and soundbars two categories the company has explored in the past. amazon could certainly afford to buy sonos though it would have to overcome regulatory hurdles. don t forget amazon had to back out of a deal to buy roomba maker irobot corp. after the european union threatened to block the acquisition. a european company like spotify might have an easier time getting a deal cleared. the streaming music service has championed the idea of hardware products that can run services from several different players which sonos does well. spotify has long wanted to get into hardware but struggled to make it happen. sonos would give them an instant entry with an excellent range of products that could run its audio services. roku is another possibility though it would probably face antitrust concerns. after all the company already sells a set of low end soundbars and tv speakers. if it could make a deal work roku would get higher end products that can potentially command higher profit margins. one caveat this may need to be a stock based deal given roku doesn t have as much cash on hand as its bigger rivals. samsung is a wild card. the company already sells soundbars and subwoofers and even acquired the harman brand in 2017. but it s failed to crack the home speaker space. it announced an echo like speaker called the galaxy home several years ago but never actually brought it to market. sonos would help it create a more consumer focused line of home audio gear and provide more modern technology for its home theater products. for consumers the best scenario is probably sonos figuring things out and remaining independent the current goal of the company. with the world s biggest tech giants expanding into every facet of our lives there is something appealing about an independent brand that plays nice with all the platforms. it s just unclear how long sonos will be able to do it alone. retail inventory of the current iphone se quickly shrinks ahead of new model s debut. one of apple s most significant new products this year will be the the iphone se s replacement. the device codenamed v59 will mark the beginning of apple s transition from qualcomm inc. cellular modem chips to silicon designed in house. it also means the company will no longer sell an iphone with the now antiquated home button. the latest model which will also add apple intelligence is set to launch by the spring and there are signs apple is gearing up for the release. according to people working in apple s retail operations a surprisingly large number of us stores have little to no inventory of the iphone se remaining. consumers can still get the device from the online store and it ships out within a few days but finding one at a brick and mortar outlet is going to be harder and harder. apple also has ceased sales of the current se in the european union because the device lacks the now required usb c port. the drawing down of inventory is a reliable sign that a new model is coming. but it also suggests that apple probably won t keep the current version around at a reduced price after the update is here. that seems like a missed opportunity since a cheap iphone could ve helped apple make inroads in some markets. the current se costs $429 and the new one might be more than that given its enhanced features. this new iphone isn t the only big product update on the horizon. as i wrote last week look out for upcoming macbook airs with the m4 donan chip as well as fresh low end ipads ipad airs and new magic keyboards in the not too distant future. apple is bringing ai to mac mail app in macos 15.4 even as it scales back notification summaries in ios 18.3. the apple intelligence rollout is continuing with the release of macos 15.3 in a few weeks. for the first time apple is bringing its genmoji custom emoji to the mac following their debut on the iphone and ipad. the company will add more features by april with ios 18.4 and macos 15.4. the big addition at that time will be the new siri digital assistant which will be able to better tap into personal information and use the app intents technology to more precisely control apps. but there s another more under the radar feature coming in april as well the mac will get the upgraded mail app that uses ai to prioritize messages and sort content into different inboxes. right now ipad and iphone users are able to tap into the feature which is terrific but mac customers have been left behind. that changes with macos 15.4 i m told. for those not familiar with the feature it sorts mail into a primary category as well as ones for transactions promotions updates and all mail. in other apple intelligence news the company is scaling back notification summaries in ios 18.3 and macos 15.3. for months news organizations and users have been complaining about incorrect or misleading notifications from apple intelligence. rather than quickly fixing its ai models apple is simply pulling the plug on summaries from news and entertainment apps. you can also more easily disable summaries from the lock screen and recaps are now italicized. apple s ex chief people officer lands at hp. it s not easy to join apple after a career outside the company. the place is run by big personalities like tim cook phil schiller greg joswiak and others who have been there for several decades. in other words if you re walking into apple thinking you re going to change how it operates you re in for a surprise. that was the case with carol surface who joined apple in 2023 as chief people officer after working at medtronic plc best buy co. and pepsico inc. she flamed out after less than two years. stella low apple s short lived vice president of communications ran into similar issues in 2022. both women were hired by cook himself and stayed at apple for way less time than anticipated but now they have another thing in common they landed at hp inc. afterward. low joined the computer maker as its chief communications officer in 2022 and recently left. surface just agreed to join hp and is starting march 24. given surface s successful and varied human resources career prior to apple she could end up being a good fit for hp. speaking of apple s insidery culture it was no surprise that surface s role was ultimately filled by deirdre o brien her predecessor and a 30 plus year veteran of the company. low meanwhile was replaced by kristin huguet a member of apple s pr department since before the original iphone went on sale. they re both capable leaders but apple will eventually need to figure out how to bring in more talent from the outside. right now the company isn t always built to handle fresh ideas from newcomers. with apple s need to innovate and find new sources of revenue that might be a problem in the not too distant future. the schedule jan. 22 samsung unveils galaxy s25 line. samsung is set to announce its galaxy s25 smartphone lineup at its unpacked event this week in san jose california. this year s devices aren t expected to get a major hardware overhaul with the company instead focusing more on software and artificial intelligence features. but samsung aims to show that it has an edge over apple in this area. stay tuned for coverage of unpacked this week including all of the details of the new devices. and if you re waiting for news on samsung smartwatches and foldable phones those will likely debut later in the year. jan. 30 apple s first quarter results. the earnings report the first under chief financial officer kevan parekh will give details of apple s all important holiday season. investors will get an idea of how the iphone 16 is selling as well as updated airpods and apple watches. the company also should provide the first real sense of whether the apple intelligence ai platform is spurring consumers to upgrade their devices. wall street is looking for about $124 billion in revenue during the period a 4 gain from a year earlier. post game q a q why is tim cook attending the trump inauguration a many apple employees are none too pleased that their ceo is heading to washington to kiss the ring and attend trump s swearing in event on monday. the move seems to clash with apple s support of diversity immigration and other progressive causes ones that cook himself has championed. but it s equally clear that apple may need trump s help over the next four years as it contends with tariffs the justice department antitrust case and mounting pressure from the european union. cook likely believes trump can alleviate these problems. he s also not alone in turning out for the president elect. most of the world s most valuable tech companies are sending a high profile leader to the event. q when are the new powerbeats pro 2 launching a the latest earbuds from apple s beats subsidiary are due imminently. the new accessory has already been submitted to the federal communications commission and other regulators for approval and the company is gearing up for a press briefing in a week or so to go over the details of the new product. the upgrades will feature a smaller overall design and improvements like spatial audio and enhanced noise cancellation that are already available on airpods. the programming code within ios also suggests that these earbuds could be capable of collecting heart rate data from a wearer. i ve previously reported that apple is working on this technology and actively testing it. q why is apple starting to use us made chips a a major under discussed risk facing apple right now is that practically 100 of its advanced processors are made in taiwan by partner tsmc. if taiwan goes down for whatever reason apple is in big trouble with no real plan b. that s why moving more production to other areas is so critical and such a shift is now underway. tsmc is running test production of lower end apple chips at a facility in arizona the first step toward more ambitious goals. over time apple hopes to get chips from other factories in the us and elsewhere including europe. let s face it the company has been fairly lucky so far that its chip production hasn t suffered major hiccups. apple s reliance on one geographic location for the most important component in its devices has been a major hazard for years. link,apple unlikely buy sonos amazon

2025-01-21,2025-01-21 14:26:39,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,xpel analyzing growth potential in the automotive market xpel analyzing growth potential in the automotive market [TITLE_END] here s my condensed analysis of xpel fyi i focus on uncovering companies with strong growth potential and sharing my insights. note all hyperlinks will lead you to direct source material disclaimer i do not own shares of xpel at the time of writing i would love to hear from the community and have a in depth conversation from ya ll. thank you enjoy macro overview electric vehicle growth the u.s. ev market is projected to show annual growth of 10.54 from 2025 2029 resulting in a market value of $156.3 billion by 2029 unit sales alone are projected to reach 2.32 million units by 2029 as well. consumers now have significantly more choices when shopping for an electric vehicle. they can choose from offerings by hyundai and many others. ev s often have unique aesthetic and maintenance needs that typically have high quality protective films and coatings. the growth in consumer adoption of ev s coincides with xpel products particularly on the impact in the aftermarket. ev owners value vehicle preservation. this creates a growing market share for xpel s products. these products also include heat reducing window films that indirectly enhance battery performance. aging vehicles the average car or truck on the road in the u.s in 2024 was more than 12.6 years old a new record according to consumers now choose to keep cars longer than they used to. this is largely because of the increases in new vehicle prices. as these older vehicles age the demand for general maintenance and preservation are more likely to rise. car price increases have climbed for four consecutive months according to as of december 2024 the average price of a new vehicle was $49 740 the second highest level ever recorded. economic uncertainty and higher costs can discourage new purchases. this situation favors repairs and maintenance of existing vehicles as the fleet continues to get older before replacement. technological advancements from xpel and competitors and were released much earlier. they have recently gained traction as consumers want paint protection film to protect their vehicles. self healing films use polymer capable of automatically repairing minor scratches and abrasions when exposed to heat. as vehicles on the road become increasingly older the demand for reduced effort in maintaining a vehicle s exterior will increase. vehicle owners will likely seek easier maintenance solutions with minimal effort that repel against water dirt and scratches more easily. consumers and manufacturers are increasingly adopting self healing films. people who want to protect their older vehicles find xpel appealing. it is also chosen to keep luxury cars in pristine condition. investment thesis xpel is a compelling investment with an attractive growth story in the automotive sector. it is supported by a strong brand presence international expansion growth and financial strength. with high expectations investors should take notice in the premium valuation risks apparent. long term growth is certainly compelling but there are clear short term headwinds including macroeconomic uncertainties that require careful monitoring. product diversification xpel is widely known for their paint protection films. these films contribute to 70 of total q3 sales and grew by 2.7 . still products like their window film and ceramic coatings have outperformed with growth of 20.6 . like home office window films antimicrobial film and niche surface protection film also out performed by 11.6 . together both segments contributed 30 to total sales. impressive growth outperformance though has largely been a significant reason for overall revenue growth in recent quarters. international expansion u.s. sales are the largest contributor to total revenue accounting for 57.2 of the total and reaching $64.6 million in q3 reflecting year over year growth of 9.4 . despite the reliance on u.s. sales international sales continue to outperform. canada is the second largest contributor at 12.8 of revenue with growth of 25.7 to $14.4 million. all international markets saw growth except for the third largest market which is china. china saw a significant decline of 11.6 to just $9.06 million. the decrease was primarily attributed to xpel s distributor working through excess inventory levels. with only a weighting of 8 of total sales the negative growth did not hurt overall sales significantly. while xpel faced challenges in china as well as minor growth of 4.1 and 1.4 in europe and the u.k strong international performance lead to record revenue. strategic partnerships xpel has established multiple strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. recent collaborations with brands like exclusive supplier partnership and have been formed. these collaborations including with service providers like have strengthened market presence. brand visibility and revenue growth have also increased as a result. the tesla partnership in particular is of major importance due to their dominance in the ev market. these recent collaborations integrate xpel s wide array of products into solutions for high profile vehicles and events. the partnerships with tesla and rivian are particularly significant. they expand their reach into the electric vehicle market that continues to rapidly grow in the u.s. and internationally. risk factors reliance on chinese distribution from a new administration will significantly impact xpel if enacted. if new tariffs are applied xpel will be faced with increases in far materials leading to higher production costs. with the u.s market as the largest source of revenue at 57.2 passing on further costs to consumers would likely reduce demand. most importantly reliance on one distributor could lead to supply chain constraints due to an over reliance on one company. price increases or delayed deliveries would harm relationships and hurt xpel s brand. the culper research short report on october 19 2023 sending xpel s stock retreating 17.3 from $51.51 per share to $42.61. a notable accusation was xpel s understated reliance on tesla. by stating tesla represented just 5 of 2023 revenue. secondly culper believes xpel is concealing a massive risk. their primary supplier entrotech inc has formed a on may 23 2023. lastly culper s claim as seen below would have massive repercussions for xpel if they are correct. additional culper info the validity of culper s claims on xpel and others have been for self benefiting public statements. what we do know for sure is the joint venture with ppg industries is in fact truthful. the extent of which xpel will become obsolete on the other is a highly questionable take. for some reason culper did not mention that xpel stands out due to their dap software. it is not because of the ppf raw material. hence xpel would know exactly how much material and company their products were installed on. these allegations were made in 2023. xpel has continued to show strong growth. the company has not skipped a beat. conclusion xpel offers an attractive growth story in the automotive industry. this growth is supported by their strong market position and international expansion. the

2025-01-22,2025-01-22 20:11:24,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,nvidia zero day options are the next big bet for etf upstart nvidia zero day options are the next big bet for etf upstart [TITLE_END] the etf industry s upstart in chief is back with another roll of the new product dice this time betting on a game changing expansion of wall street s zero day options boom. matt tuttle who struck gold with leveraged meme stock funds but fell flat with his jim cramer etfs has filed to create a line of new offerings that will trade fast twitch derivatives on popular companies beloved by the retail investing masses. think nvidia corp. tesla inc. microstrategy inc. and more. the gamble publicly traded single stock options aren t available on a daily basis meaning 0dte bets can currently only occur on a friday when weekly monthly and quarterly contracts expire. yet tuttle says he is convinced it s a matter of time before derivatives tied to individual companies shift to daily expiry. whether that s three months from now six months from now two years from now i have no idea the tuttle capital management ceo said. my thinking is if i do believe that s going to happen i want to be first in line for it. in the meantime tuttle has come up with a workaround for his new etfs which could launch in the first half of the year provided the securities and exchange commission doesn t object. they ll trade so called flex options customized contracts that allow users to set terms such as strike prices and expiration dates and roll them on a daily basis. such contracts can be listed on exchanges without approvals in advance tuttle said. america s dynamic $11 trillion etf industry is no stranger to investment strategies being prepared before demand feasibility or even regulatory approval is assured. increasingly complicated strategies featuring diverse leverage and return targets are being packaged into the easily traded wrapper and sold to the masses. tuttle is seeking to capitalize on two hot but controversial trends on wall street selling options to generate income and trading those with zero days to expiration or 0dte. his firm plans a series of so called 0dte covered call etfs targeting mostly technology megacaps including apple inc. and microsoft corp. to ben johnson head of client solutions at morningstar the industry s emphasis on first mover advantage and apparent indifference to the risks of many strategies highlight the growing competition between firms for new business. another blast from the etf industry s spaghetti cannon a shot fired in hopes that a few of these products might stick to the wall johnson said. sponsors are clearly not all that interested in whether these products actually have any long term investment merit he said. the concept of an etf using 0dte options is not new. the likes of defiance etfs and roundhill investments have launched etfs focused on indexes such as the s p 500 and the nasdaq 100 that aim to harvest income from zero day contracts. but almost three years after derivatives on indexes and etfs began expiring daily the same change has yet to be made for single stock options. unlike s p 500 index options that are proprietary to cboe global markets the trading venue at the center of the 0dte craze listing single stock zero day contracts would be an industry wide effort said a spokesperson at the exchange. tuttle attracted widespread attention in 2021 when he launched a fund betting against cathie wood s ark innovation etf. while his attempt to ride the fame of cramer the host of cnbc s mad money show sputtered in short order his foray into super leveraged single stock etfs produced some of 2024 s biggest hits. the etf industry is very clever about finding workarounds to buy time until the real thing is ready eric balchunas senior etf analyst with bloomberg intelligence said of the proposed funds. in the end how the sausage is made isn t that important to investors. they just care that they re getting this sort of cool hot sauce and end product. thoughts on this etfs that become massive from investors not understanding the risks are nothing new but this will lead to interesting trading situations when there s dislocation between these theorized 0 dte underlying etfs and security itself. i can foresee a situation where 0 dtes are massively overvalued undervalued compared to what the underlying should theoretically be and then take a arbitrage position on these . guess they really want that options gambling money from the people who can t get approved to trade options. link,nvidia

2025-01-24,2025-01-24 18:45:49,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,$500b stargate ai project what sectors and stocks could win big $500b stargate ai project what sectors and stocks could win big [TITLE_END] so the $500 billion stargate ai project was just announced and honestly that s a huge amount of money being thrown into ai and related tech. it s got me thinking what sectors and companies could ride this wave in the near future if history tells us anything investments of this scale tend to shake up entire industries with both big names and under the radar players benefiting. let s break it down by sector because there s a lot to unpack here 1. semiconductors the brains behind ai ai doesn t run without hardware and semiconductors are at the heart of it all. gpus cpus and those fancy ai specialized chips are the foundation of machine learning. companies like nvidia amd and intel are already dominating this space and i wouldn t be surprised if they see even more demand. nvidia especially is practically the poster child for ai hardware. their growth has been insane and a project of this magnitude could push it even further. expect ai chips to continue driving their revenue in the coming years. 2. cloud computing data centers ai projects need a ton of computing power and storage. that s where the big cloud providers aws microsoft azure and google cloud come in. these companies are likely already gearing up to grab their slice of the stargate pie. then you ve got data center companies like equinix and digital realty trust which could also benefit. all this ai data has to live somewhere and these companies provide the backbone for hosting it. 3. ai software players it s not just about the hardware companies building the actual ai tools and software are in a great spot too. think palantir c3.ai and snowflake. these players already help businesses make sense of their data and implement ai driven solutions so they could see a major surge in demand. the rise of ai as a service could also give these companies a big boost as the stargate project moves forward. 4. startups the dark horses this is where things get really interesting. while the big names are obvious winners startups working on niche ai applications could also see some major growth. some of these smaller companies aren t on anyone s radar right now but they could pop up as key players or even get acquired by the bigger guys. if you re into high risk high reward opportunities this might be where you want to look. 5. telecom networking supporting the ai boom ai depends on fast low latency networks to transfer data efficiently. that s why telecom and networking companies are probably smiling right now. companies like cisco juniper networks and even those working on 5g infrastructure could benefit. after all all that ai data has to move through fast reliable connections and these are the folks making that possible. 6. autonomous tech evs this one s a bit of a wildcard but it makes sense. companies like tesla waymo and mobileye that are working on self driving cars and autonomous tech could see a boost. ai is critical for advancing self driving capabilities and a major investment like this might accelerate developments in the space. 7. cybersecurity as ai adoption grows so do concerns around data privacy and security. cybersecurity companies like crowdstrike palo alto networks and zscaler could also be beneficiaries. protecting sensitive ai systems and the data they process is going to be a top priority. so what do you all think are there other sectors or companies that might benefit any smaller names worth keeping an eye on let s discuss,$500b stargate ai project sectors stocks win big $500b stargate ai project sectors stocks win big

humblest of you to confirm the way. big brains didn t agree when i said pltr bumpy revenues weren t a concern . big brains didn t agree when i said get into bitcoin before the wall street wave . big brains didn t agree when i said tesla revenues were about to go parabolic . it s true when they say bears sound smart at parties but the bulls make money. big brains are too smart for their own good blowing up fears in their minds. why do i even posts selfishly to have a record of being right. i love looking back and saying yep yep yep and laughing at big brains while wiping my ass with cash. i didn t go to harvard or work for a big firm. i have a chip on my shoulder and i m here to outclass them all. so fellow idiots i think we have another winner. time to get hyped. uipath $13.86 . big brains claim rpa is dead those pushing ai agents and claiming rpa is dead are wrong. they assume ai agents can be developed by skipping straight to step z when in reality they will need to build steps a y. ai currently only has a brain. it needs hands and tools connected it to perform real work. uipath has built out steps a y and is ready to take step z. uipath is in a position to capitalize on the power of gen ai. there s a spectrum of automation applications and rpa will still make the most sense in many use cases as the most efficient tool for the job . ai agents will have their place but uipath will have a system to orchestrate the spectrum of tools spanning from rpa hybrid to advanced ai agents. big brains claim uipath has no moat. uipath s product is more differentiated than the market gives them credit for. the market seems to conflate all rpa vendors as interchangeable but i believe there are nuanced and important differences between the offerings. uipath appears to be the most robust user friendly and an innovation leader. where s their moat 1. network effects. they have a large install base with 10 000 customers 2. uipath is immune to vendor locking . 3. preferred vendor partner to major consulting companies . 4. existing partnerships with major software companies gives uipath exposure to potential new customers. 5. uipath has a large base of experienced rpa developers that prefer to use uipath and who are likely to recommend it where they go. 6. founder led. founder is a product focused engineer not a career executive playing politics in a bureaucracy. this allows uipath to be nimbler and seize market opportunities as they arise. big brains claim uipath s growth story is over. gen ai can have a similar effect on uipath as it did on palantir and their aip product. gen ai will make the existing uipath platform exponentially more powerful meaning more and higher value use cases. as uipath ai agent use cases are shared with the world their sales

over tiktok npr reports [TITLE_END] the administration of u.s. president donald trump is working on a plan to save tiktok that involves tapping software company oracle and a group of outside investors to effectively take control of the app s global operations national public radio reported on saturday. under the deal being negotiated by the white house tiktok s china based owner bytedance would retain a minority stake in the company but the app s algorithm data collection and software updates would be overseen by oracle which already provides the foundation of tiktok s web infrastructure npr reported. the npr report cited two people with knowledge of the talks. the white house and oracle had no immediate comment. the short video app used by 170 million americans was taken offline temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by its chinese owner bytedance on national security grounds or be banned took effect on jan. 19. trump after taking office a day later signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in place after u.s. officials warned that under bytedance there was a risk of americans data being misused. the possible deal reported by npr would mean that american investors would own a majority stake in tiktok. however the report added that the terms of the deal could change and are still being hammered out. the goal is for oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with tiktok a person directly involved in the talks but not authorized to speak publicly was quoted as saying by npr. bytedance wouldn t completely go away but it would minimize chinese ownership. other potential investors who are engaged in the talks include microsoft npr reported. officials from oracle and the white house held a meeting on friday about a potential deal and another meeting has been scheduled for next week npr reported. oracle was interested in a tiktok stake in the tens of billions but the rest of the deal is in flux the npr report cited the source as saying. trump has said he would like the united states to have a 50 ownership position in a joint venture in tiktok. npr cited another source as saying that appeasing congress is seen as a key hurdle by the white house. free speech advocates have opposed tiktok s ban under a law passed by the u.s. congress and signed by former president joe biden. the company says u.s. officials misstated its ties to china arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the united states on cloud servers operated by oracle while content moderation decisions that affect american users are also made in the u.s. thoughts there are a ton of entities people who have been rumored to buy tik tok i

2025-01-26,2025-01-26 19:27:18,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,apple remains a threat in ar even as meta and google race ahead apple remains a threat in ar even as meta and google race ahead [TITLE_END] meta and google have jumped out ahead in the race to make augmented reality glasses for consumers but apple remains a looming threat. also the iphone maker brings in a fixer for its siri and ai efforts and the company has a decision to make about its longtime chairman. samsung meanwhile just unveiled impressive new ai features and is poised to beat apple to market with a skinny smartphone. a decade ago it began developing ar technology for its now defunct attempt to build a self driving vehicle. the idea a windshield that could overlay navigation information traffic alerts camera feeds and other data while the car drove around town on its own. apple even built a simulator of the concept at its silicon valley offices and managed to turn the idea into a working prototype that showed promise to executives. but the company quickly realized that this minority report like experience would be too power hungry and expensive to put inside of a vehicle. so it turned its attention to headsets which can provide the same data in a smaller package. a person in the car could simply wear some headgear instead of needing to have the technology built into the windshield. the car glasses idea didn t get too far either. but apple s vehicle group poured resources into developing ar displays and used virtual reality goggles to demonstrate the car s capabilities. that ultimately led to apple s work on a consumer headset. at the time chief executive officer tim cook felt that vr goggles were too isolating. he preferred ar which keeps users in the real world while superimposing data on their field of vision. but it was also clear that the true ar dream a lightweight pair of glasses that customers could wear all day was still far off. that s about the time when mike rockwell stepped in. that executive who currently oversees apple s vision pro division moved the ar and vr efforts into a team that was separate from the car unit. rockwell and his staff spent the better part of two years creating a headset prototype that melded vr and ar into an approach that apple eventually called spatial computing. this was the great compromise users weren t truly seeing the real world around them but the device s pass through cameras made it feel like they were. the project was greenlit and the company eventually spent billions of dollars to develop the device all while continuing to work on making true ar glasses a reality. that led to the release of the vision pro mixed reality headset a year ago. apple had originally hoped to release ar spectacles as a follow up to the vision pro but the technical challenges were just too great. such a product remains far away and the company is still tinkering with the underlying technologies. at the same time rivals like meta platforms inc. and alphabet inc. s google have jumped ahead in the ar race. meta showed off a prototype of augmented reality glasses last year and google is working with samsung electronics co. on their own next generation devices. meta also has had success with its ray ban smart glasses which don t have a display but can handle tasks like recording video and making phone calls. the vision pro meanwhile has largely been a flop hurt by its cumbersome design and $3 500 price tag. that said it s hard to discount apple s innovation abilities. work on the ar screens remains ongoing at a secretive facility in santa clara california one town over from the company s home base in cupertino. though there were layoffs at the site last year when apple scrapped plans for in house smartwatch displays the company kept some employees around to work on ar technology along with a manufacturing facility to develop and test future screens. tepid demand for the vision pro has only made apple more certain that ar glasses are a superior format. but the executives involved in the effort don t think a product will be ready for three years or more. in the meantime apple expects to release other devices in the style of vision pro that it hopes will be cheaper and more enticing to consumers. while it develops the ar technology for future devices the company is conducting user studies at its offices to gauge the appeal of features and interfaces. apple is already working on a version of visionos the vision pro s software that will run on glasses. it s also exploring other types of wearable products including a rival to meta s ray ban spectacles and even camera equipped airpods. the question now is whether apple s rivals are getting too far ahead. meta s ar prototype called orion will set the stage for a consumer product by 2027. and google s new android xr operating system is meant to usher in a wave of headsets and glasses with samsung first in line to release devices. when i first tested android xr in december at google s headquarters the company showed me several glasses prototypes with and without displays. they seemed polished for prototypes but they won t hit the market until the display technology improves and costs come down. another issue to be solved battery life. meta google and samsung also aren t slowing down on development of vr and mixed reality devices. meta is working on quest 4 vr goggles as well as a new high end model that could eventually become a successor to the quest pro mixed reality headset i m told. samsung meanwhile showed off the hardware for its moohan mixed reality headset during its unpacked event this past week. in interviews samsung and google executives hinted that this headset would be cheaper than the vision pro and that it s on track to debut this year. the companies won t have to share the spotlight with apple which is unlikely to ship any major new head worn device in 2025. but the real showdown will come in the years ahead when ar glasses are refined enough to serve as a smartphone replacement. you can imagine a future where people use smart spectacles as their primary mobile device and then turn to a mixed reality or vr headset for gaming or computing tasks. in that vision head worn devices will have supplanted both phones and laptops markets worth hundreds of billions of dollars. given what s at stake apple can t afford to stay on the sidelines too long. but the company does have a history of swooping into already established markets and beating competitors with better design and more elegantly integrated hardware and software. the playbook it used so effectively in smartphones and watches could work again. link,apple remains threat ar meta google race ahead apple remains

about deepseek s latest ai model being cost effective while running on reduced capability chips casting doubt on the validity of the sky high valuations for companies like nvidia corp. the chinese firm s product released last week is now at the top of apple inc. s app store rankings. deepseek shows that it is possible to develop powerful ai models that cost less said vey sern ling managing director at union bancaire privee. it can potentially derail the investment case for the entire ai supply chain which is driven by high spending from a small handful of hyperscalers. founded by quant

2025-01-27,2025-01-27 14:55:01,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",wallstreetbets,sell side analyst notes on nvda this morning sell side analyst notes on nvda this morning [TITLE_END] bofa deepseek concerns overblown in ai semis but foundational models keep demand high on january 20 china based ai lab deepseek created a mini flurry in the ai semiconductor space by releasing a free open source r1 model that reportedly outperforms leading western ai models such as openai s gpt 4. the model s creators claimed it took only two months and less than $6 million to build using older generation nvidia h800 chips. if accurate this advancement suggests model usefulness and accuracy might not scale directly with compute memory networking potentially reducing the demand for expensive ai chips. however we believe this concern about slowing ai scaling is overstated. based on available data deepseek s model appears to be a distilled model relying on larger foundation models like meta s open source llama. it is these foundational llms where significant and rising infrastructure costs are incurred as evidenced by meta s plan to raise cy25e capex by over 56 year over year to $60 $65 billion. in our view we will continue to see increasing compute demand driven by a mix of large foundational models derivative models and inference at scale across diverse cloud enterprise and sovereign ai customers. we maintain our buy ratings on nvidia broadcom and marvell technology . jpmorgan analyst sandeep deshpande investors are concerned that rather than impede china s progress in ai the us restrictions have engendered innovation that has enabled the development of a model that prioritises efficiency. ... the news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of microsoft which is spending $80bn in 25 while meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn. open ai also announced that the stargate project intends to invest $500m over the next four years building new ai infrastructure in the us. thus with these considerable sums flowing into ai investments in the us that deepseek s highly efficient and lower resource intensive ai model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the ai investment cycle may be over hyped and a more efficient future is possible. jefferies analyst edison lee re evaluating computing power needs could cause 2026 ai capex to fall ...we believe ds s success could drive two possible industry strategies 1 still pursue more computing power to drive even faster model improvements and 2 refocus on efficiency and roi meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026. bernstein analyst stacy rasgon is deepseek doomsday for ai buildouts we don t think so...we believe that 1 deepseek did not build openai for $5m 2 the models look fantastic but we don t think they are miracles and 3 the resulting twitterverse panic over the weekend seems overblown. though rasgon acknowledged deepseek s models are good. the analyst kept his outperform ratings on nvidia and broadcom advising clients not to buy into the doomsday scenarios. citi analyst malik while the dominance of the us companies on the most advanced ai models could be potentially challenged that said we estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment us access to more advanced chips is an advantage. thus we don t expect leading ai companies would move away from more advanced gpus. malik maintained a buy rating on nvidia . raymond james semiconductor analyst srini pajjuri if deepseek s innovations are adopted broadly an argument can be made that model training costs could come down significantly even at u.s. hyperscalers potentially raising questions about the need for 1 million xpu gpu clusters as projected by some... a more logical implication is that deepseek will drive even more urgency among u.s. hyperscalers to leverage their key advantage to distance themselves from cheaper alternatives. pajjuri reiterated buy ratings on nvidia and asml. cantor analyst c.j. muse following release of deepseek s v3 llm there has been great angst as to the impact for compute demand and therefore fears of peak spending on gpus. we think this view is farthest from the truth and that the announcement is actually very bullish with agi seemingly closer to reality and jevons paradox almost certainly leading

2025-01-27,2025-01-27 16:28:40,TSLA,Tesla,investing,third coast bancshares continued growth in a booming region third coast bancshares continued growth in a booming region [TITLE_END] i have been covering numerous small mid cap banks for quite some time now and i am bullish on the continued growth of many names. tcbx is based in the high growth texas metropolitan areas with very impressive growth despite the fact texas has more banks than any other state. here is my analysis on this particular community bank hope to hear from everyone on their thoughts on this company the future outlook on financials macro overview economic strength of texas third coast operates in texas whom remain one of the fastest growing states in the u.s. that recently faster than the nation as a whole. business friendly policies like no state income tax have helped corporate relocation s like tesla oracle and hewlett packard. texas s economy is the when compared to nations of the world and is now valued at $2.6 trillion. texas is expected to continue to grow and with that the need for lending capabilities should favor third coast. impact of potential deregulation in the new administrations economic agenda. for community banks like third coast this will allow them the ability to operate more freely with relaxed capital requirements. with fewer regulatory requirements third coast can selectively increase their exposure to higher yielding loans and potential acquisitions. typically the ability to freely lend boosts bank earnings and growth. it allows the industry the flexibility to regulate themselves. with deregulation almost certain focusing on further risk taking is important. this approach may lead to increases in nonperforming loans down the line. investment thesis presence in a high growth region texas has one of the strongest economies in the u.s. consistently outpacing the national gdp growth rate. third coast has shown a great track record of impressive growth with a cagr of over 25 and eps growth of over 18 from 2020 to 2024. deregulation in the banking industry is all but certain in the coming months. this will lead to increased lending capabilities that will fuel additional growth in a region that continues to outperform. third coast s lending increased 9 to $3.97 billion. urban centers like austin dallas fort worth and houston are hubs for technology energy and manufacturing. in particular residential construction is anticipated to rebound in 2025 fueled by increased populations jobs and incomes. current valuation third coast has a p e of 14.65 slightly below the yet the stock has risen over 93 in the last year alone and is just 2.5 from its 52 week high of $37.65. despite the significant increase third coast is still slightly undervalued. it is significantly under their five year average high p e of 16.9. with continued growth expected in the long term we believe it is best to either wait for a potential pullback or continue holding. strong financial results fierce competition in texas is intense with hundreds of banks. nevertheless third coast has achieved impressive results since their 2021 ipo. revenue has increased 80 eps 194 and net income 317 . profitability metrics like return on average assets return on average equity and net profit margin have set new records. they have hit highs of 1.05 11.48 and 27.82 respectively. nonperforming assets did however increase by 48.7 to 0.58 of total assets. while increases are not desired the total is still significantly under the industry average indicating proper risk management for now. loan growth quality nonperforming loans often solid loan growth comes with risky lending practices. third coast predominately lends to cre and c i combined accounting for almost 60 of the total portfolio. nonperforming loans increased by 61.4 to $27.95 million. a large reason for such a major increase stemmed from c i accounting for over 51 of nonperforming loans. non farm non residential owner occupied loans accounted for 39 . fortunately non farm non residential owner occupied loans decreased 14 despite their 11.3 weighting. nonperforming assets unsurprisingly nonperforming assets increased by 48.7 as a result. currently nonperforming assets are only at 0.58 which is still minor for a community bank. we do not want to see a continuation of nonperforming assets. they can easily start to wipe out a bank s equity. third coast has grown fantastically as has nonperforming loans and assets. both are now at all time highs for the banks. we will be monitoring this development in the upcoming quarters to ensure this does not rapidly continue. earnings overview revenue fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 16 to $171.38 million. third coast benefited from a 15.2 increase in net interest income due to elevated interest rates. this allowed the bank to reprice loans at higher yields. floating rate loans especially boosted interest income despite rising deposit costs. total non interest income also saw impressive growth of 29.4 to $10.62 million contributing to the overall increase in revenue. net income an impressive increase of 42.7 lead to a total of $47.67 million. this increase was primarily the result of increased net interest income resulting from loan growth. eps earnings per share saw strength with growth of 40.4 to $2.78. higher

biggest one day loss in u.s. history [TITLE_END] nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on monday the biggest drop for any company on a single day in u.s. history. the chipmaker s stock price plummeted 17 to close at $118.58. it was nvidia s worst day on the market since march 16 2020 which was early in the covid pandemic. after surpassing apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company nvidia s drop on monday led a 3.1 slide in the tech heavy nasdaq. the selloff was sparked by concerns that chinese artificial intelligence lab deepseek is presenting increased competition in the global ai battle. late last month deepseek unveiled a free open source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build using reduced capability chips from nvidia called h800s. nvidia s graphics processing units dominate the market for ai data center chips in the u.s. with tech giants like alphabet meta and amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their ai models. analysts at cantor wrote in a report on monday that the release of deepseek s latest technology has caused great angst as to the impact for compute demand and therefore fears of peak spending on gpus. the analysts who recommend buying nvidia shares said they think this view is farthest from the truth and that advancements in ai will most likely lead to the ai industry wanting more compute not less. but after nvidia s huge run up the stock soared 239 in 2023 and 171 last year the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. broadcom the other big u.s. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from ai fell 17 on monday pulling its market cap down by $200 billion. data center companies reliant on nvidia s gpus for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. dell hewlett packard enterprise and super micro computer dropped at least 5.8 . oracle a part of president donald trump s latest ai initiative fell 14 . for nvidia the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in september which was the biggest one day market value loss in history at the time unseating meta s $232 billion loss in 2022. before that the steepest drop was $182 billion by apple in 2020. nvidia s decline is more than double the market cap of coca cola and chevron and exceeds the market value of both oracle and netflix. ceo jensen huang s net worth also took a massive hit declining roughly $21 billion according to forbes real time billionaires list. the move demoted huang to 17th on the richest person list. the sudden excitement around deepseek over the weekend pushed its app past openai s chatgpt as the most downloaded free app in the u.s. on apple s app store. the model s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on u.s. chip exports to china. venture capitalist david sacks who was tapped by trump to be the white house s ai and crypto czar wrote on x that deepseek s model shows that the ai

history [TITLE_END] alternative source bloomberg nvidia corp. s plunge fueled by investor concern about chinese artificial intelligence startup deepseek erased a record amount of stock market value from the world s largest company. nvidia shares tumbled 17 monday the biggest drop since march 2020 erasing $589 billion from the company s market capitalization. that eclipsed the previous record a 9 drop in september that wiped out about $279 billion in value and was the biggest in us stock market history. the drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight nvidia has in major indexes. including monday s slump nvidia selloffs have caused eight of the top ten biggest one day drops in the s p 500 index based on market value according to data compiled by bloomberg. the s p 500 fell 1.5 monday and the nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3 . the semiconductor maker led a broader selloff in technology stocks after deepseek s low cost approach reignited concerns that big us companies have poured too much money into developing artificial intelligence. the chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price. the latest ai model of deepseek released last week is widely seen as competitive with those of openai and meta platforms inc. the open sourced product was founded by quant fund chief liang wenfeng and is now at the top of apple inc. s app store rankings. concerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current ai business model which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy jefferies analysts said in a note to clients. nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on ai because they design semiconductors used in the technology. while that heavy spending looks poised to continue investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that aren t showing a sufficient return on the investment. meta announced plans on friday to boost capital expenditures on ai projects this year by about half to as much as $65 billion sending its shares to a record high. that came on the heels of openai softbank group corp. and oracle corp. announcing a $100 billion joint venture called stargate to build out data centers and ai infrastructure projects around the us. in a bid to stall china s progress in ai the us has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced nvidia ai chips to others. but deepseek s progress suggests chinese ai engineers have found a way to work around the export bans focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. nvidia said in a statement monday that deepseek s model is an excellent ai advancement and indicated that the chinese company didn t violate us restrictions that limit access to advanced us chips in creating its technology. it also added that inference or the work of running ai models requires requires significant numbers of nvidia gpus and high performance

i ve read about this stock here and in other subreddits so i did my own research and placed my bet. so it is not intended as financial advice of any kind. since english is not my first language i used some ai magic to wrap up all my dd in two different formats . and i know the price at close today was higher. eastman kodak company equity research report rating overweight target price $18.50 current price $6.79 sector specialty chemicals industrial manufacturing investment summary we initiate coverage on eastman kodak with an overweight rating and a target price of $18.50 representing a 172 upside . kodak is undergoing a structural transformation pivoting from a declining legacy print business into higher margin verticals such as pharmaceutical manufacturing and advanced materials . despite strong underlying asset value significant hidden real estate assets and a near term deleveraging catalyst the stock trades at only 0.4x book value well below its intrinsic worth. we believe wall street misprices kodak by failing to incorporate the imminent launch of its pharma division in 2025 with attractive margin dynamics. debt reduction from pension surplus improving fcf and balance sheet health. strong tariff tailwinds under the trump administration positioning kodak as a beneficiary of u.s. domestic manufacturing policies. underappreciated real estate assets with a potential fair value of $175m $200m . valuation snapshot metric base case bear case bull case dcf valuation $18.42 $11.63 $24.00 liquidation value $17.78 $12.50 $22.50 ev ebitda valuation $12.30 $9.75 $15.00 p e valuation $11.35 $8.50 $13.50 current market price $6.79 $6.79 $6.79 our target price of $18.50 is based on a blended dcf and sum of the parts valuation. 1. company overview strategic pivot kodak operates across four primary segments 1. print imaging declining legacy business but kodak is stabilizing margins at 20 gross margin . 2. advanced materials chemicals high margin segment that supplies key specialty chemicals. 3. brand licensing real estate kodak owns eastman business park a 1 200 acre industrial park undervalued on the balance sheet. 4. pharmaceuticals new revenue driver projected to generate $149m in 2025 with 35 margins . kodak s pharmaceutical expansion is the primary catalyst for margin improvement and revenue diversification . with government incentives supporting domestic drug manufacturing kodak is well positioned for long term growth. 2. financial model valuation 2.1 revenue breakdown forecast division 2024 revenue 2025 revenue 2029 revenue print imaging $570m $550m

from 2024 due to lower capex and debt reduction. 3. key catalysts upside drivers 3.1 pension surplus debt reduction kodak will use $315m in pension assets to reduce debt lowering interest costs by $25m annually . net debt will decline to $145m reducing leverage to 0.7x ebitda. this significantly increases free cash flow starting in 2025 . 3.2 pharma division launch in 2025 kodak s api manufacturing facility is near completion. the pharma sector offers 30 40 gross margins significantly higher than print. government incentives for domestic api production could drive contract wins. projected revenue $149m in 2025 $250m by 2029. 3.3 trade tariff tailwinds trump s trade policies favor u.s. manufacturers in specialty chemicals and pharma. tariffs on chinese imports could make kodak s products more competitive . kodak is well positioned as a u.s. based supplier . 3.4 real estate monetization hidden value in ebp eastman business park is worth $175m $200m but it s booked at $60m . leasing out or selling portions of ebp could unlock value . 4. investment risks mitigation risk factor impact mitigation strategy declining print business print revenue declining 5 yoy. high margin pharma chemicals focus on . execution risk in pharma regulatory or contract issues. target pre signed api supply contracts . supply chain tariff risks cost increases from import tariffs. domestic manufacturing advantage offsets risk. 5. conclusion a deep value play kodak presents a compelling risk reward opportunity driven by 1. pharma division launch in 2025 . 2. debt reduction through pension surplus boosting fcf. 3. hidden real estate value in eastman business park . 4. trade tailwinds under trump favoring domestic manufacturing . rating overweight target price $18.50 kodak is a highly asymmetric deep value opportunity with significant potential for re rating in 2025. eli5 why kodak is a good investment right now imagine you have an old company like kodak which used to make cameras and films. people think it s outdated but here s the secret kodak is quietly transforming into something much bigger. and wall street isn t paying attention yet . here s why smart investors might want to take a closer look at kodak 1 kodak is getting into pharmaceuticals kodak is building a factory to make ingredients for medicines. this new business starts in 2025 and will make a lot more money per dollar spent than selling old school film and prints. think of it like kodak switching from selling dvds to streaming movies it s the future this new drug business could bring in over

linked group improperly obtained openai data [TITLE_END] microsoft corp. and openai are investigating whether data output from openai s technology was obtained in an unauthorized manner by a group linked to chinese artificial intelligence startup deepseek according to people familiar with the matter. microsoft s security researchers in the fall observed individuals they believe may be linked to deepseek exfiltrating a large amount of data using the openai application programming interface or api said the people who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. software developers can pay for a license to use the api to integrate openai s proprietary artificial intelligence models into their own applications. microsoft an openai technology partner and its largest investor notified openai of the activity the people said. such activity could violate openai s terms of service or could indicate the group acted to remove openai s restrictions on how much data they could obtain the people said. deepseek earlier this month released a new open source artificial intelligence model called r1 that can mimic the way humans reason upending a market dominated by openai and us rivals such as google and meta platforms inc. the chinese upstart said r1 rivaled or outperformed leading us developers products on a range of industry benchmarks including for mathematical tasks and general knowledge and was built for a fraction of the cost. the potential threat to the us firms edge in the industry sent technology stocks tied to ai including microsoft nvidia corp. oracle corp. and google parent alphabet inc. tumbling on monday erasing a total of almost $1 trillion in market value. david sacks president donald trump s artificial intelligence czar said tuesday there s substantial evidence that deepseek leaned on the output of openai s models to help develop its own technology. in an interview with fox news sacks described a technique called distillation whereby one ai model uses the outputs of another for training purposes to develop similar capabilities. there s substantial evidence that what deepseek did here is they distilled knowledge out of openai models and i don t think openai is very happy about this sacks said without detailing the evidence. in a statement responding to sacks comments openai didn t directly address his comments about

[TITLE_END] thoughts obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business tmus and aapl. tsla is also possibly affected because spacex trades as a proxy to tsla news. vz t other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that i won t hold my breath. apple inc. has been secretly working with spacex and t mobile us inc. to add support for the starlink network in its latest iphone software providing an alternative to the company s in house satellite communication service. the companies have been testing iphones with the starlink service from elon musk s space exploration technologies corp. according to people with knowledge of the matter. in an under the radar move the smartphone s latest software update released monday now supports the technology. the tie up comes as a surprise t mobile has previously only specified starlink as an option for samsung electronics co. phones such as the z fold and s24 models. apple meanwhile already provides a globalstar inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range. t mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the starlink service and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iphones as part of a beta test. the first users received text messages from t mobile saying you re in the t mobile starlink beta. you can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. to start experiencing coverage beyond please update to ios 18.3. users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iphone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature. an apple spokesperson declined to comment while t mobile said that the test will begin with select optimized smartphones and that the full launch will support the vast majority of modern smartphones. t mobile has also opened the beta to some users running android 15 the latest version of the google operating system. a representative for spacex didn t immediately respond to a request for comment. ever since apple teamed up with globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022 there s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. the day after apple s 2022 announcement musk posted on x that his company has had some promising conversations with apple about starlink connectivity. here s how it will work when a t mobile iphone is in an area without cellular connectivity devices that are part of the starlink program will first try to pair with spacex satellites. users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the globalstar service or contact emergency services through apple. the initial version of starlink is exclusively for texting. but spacex and t mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. the program also is only available in the us for now. that contrasts with apple s globalstar service which works in several countries. spacex is looking to expand starlink to other carriers globally. there s another major difference between the two services. the current apple feature requires users to point their iphone to the sky to find a satellite. the starlink option meanwhile is designed to work automatically even when the phone is in a customer s pocket. both the starlink and apple satellite features are designed to work in off the grid areas such as hiking trails that don t have cellular service. the capabilities can t be used in places where a mobile phone network is within reach. support for the apple feature is available on most current iphone models and the company plans to bring it to its ultra smartwatch later this year bloomberg news has reported. t mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iphone is supported as part of the ios 18.3 software release. as of now the number of users in the beta is minimal with t mobile planning to expand the program in february. apple s announcement of ios 18.3 touted ai features and bug fixes but it didn t disclose the starlink support. spacex requested authority to begin beta testing the service starting monday. the federal communications commission granted spacex conditional approval for its satellites to supplement t mobile s cellular network in november. link,apple spacex link support starlink satellite network

is a daily watchlist for short term trading i might trade all none of the stocks listed and even stocks not listed i am targeting potentially good candidates for short term trading i have no opinion on them as investments. the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting everything else is secondary. today openai may make history. trying out longer form more detailed catalyst examinations over the short form with more tickers. news ticker catalyst reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. revenue of $48.4b vs $47b but guided revenue short of consensus and didn t provide fy25 revenue outlook . their capex announcement was $60 65b vs $52.4b expected and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher opex and depreciation. also announced plans to grow meta s ai team significantly. volume market cap technicals earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that. context decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye popping capex number and selling the company. sector context there is a major next level breakthrough that openai is expected to

volume targets and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in austin in june. this puts them in competition with waymo uber. personally i think the vision only approach is not viable in the long run but hey i m no self driving phd. capex was also higher as with meta due to spending increases from ai training infra costs and battery production capacity. volume market cap
