2024-01-05,2024-01-05 23:25:05,TSLA,Tesla,pennystocks,what is the difference in profits from penny stocks compared to expensive stocks if they both went up by 10 in a month in share value and you have invested the same amount in both what is the difference in profits from penny stocks compared to expensive stocks if they both went up by 10 in a month in share value and you have invested the same amount in both [TITLE_END] edit solved answered. thanks new to trading. so i don t know if this question even makes sense. so here s the scenario if a penny stocks company increases it s shares value by 10 in 1 month. and if a big company like tesla increases it s shares value by 10 in 1 month. and i ve spent 100 in both. shouldn t my return profit be the same won t i have 110 end of month in both scenarios even if their shares value are very different the percent increase is the same. so my return on investment is the same so apart from the potential for quick big percentages increase why isn t it a good idea to spend the same money on a big company which is always increasing it s value every year instead of up and down like most penny stocks thanks in advance

important development opportunities aigc is firmly top 1 in the current technology field [TITLE_END] x200b the year of 2023 has been a unique year for ai which occured countless product launches power changes within the company and the race to launch the next major aigc innovation. currently openai s chatgpt has been huge success prompting each major technology company to release its own version. large technology companies have fully invested in the development of generative ai and various ai models have emerged such as meta llama 2 google s bard chatbot and gemini in addition generative ai allows artificial intelligence technology to develop bringing a historical turning point in the large scale adoption of machine learning. the new round of technological revolution initiated by generative ai is far beyond the imagination of ordinary people today which means that a huge historical opportunity is coming. from an application point of view various applications derived from generative ai are gradually trying to land in various industries including art generation text generation music generation and more complex tasks such as video generation and virtual reality environment generation. generative ai based knowledge base search text summary content or code creation takes productivity to a new stage. generative artificial intelligence is firmly top 1 in the current technology field and aigc represents a new trend of ai technology development. in the past traditional ai favored analytical capabilities but now ai is generating new content making a leap from perceptual understanding of the world to creating the world. according to the prediction of industry insiders from 2024 it will enter the era of generative ai applications and even become the 2.0 era of changing traditional industries. generated ai will contribute about $7 trillion to the global economy and increase the overall economic benefits of ai by about 50 percent according to data released by leading consultancy mckinsey. according to the top 10 strategic technology trends of 2024 released by global it research and consulting firm gartner by 2026 more than 80 of enterprises will be connected to generative ai or large models but the proportion is less than 5 at the beginning of 2023. companies began to compete in the ai field due to the rise of generative ai especially the application of large language model is fundamentally change the operation of technology industry industry technology is driven by ai into a new era this will prompt generative ai and industry model technology no longer limited to the boundary of the industry become an important strategic development direction of technology giants. in january microsoft released azure openai services by combining azure s enterprise capabilities with openai s generative ai model capabilities in march google opened the api of the ai big model palm and introduced generative ai into google s enterprise online collaboration platform google workspace. amazon entered generative ai a little later than microsoft and google but the company has not followed the two giants taking a new approach. according to the news amazon recently announced the launch of a number of blockbuster releases around the theme of reconstructing cloud infrastructure computing storage and enterprise generated ai to help cloud customers quickly realize digital transformation and improve the speed of enterprise generated ai innovation. in addition amazon has introduced five new amazon sagemaker features that make it easier and faster for enterprises to build train and deploy machine learning models that support a variety of generative ai usage scenarios enabling customers to easily integrate generative ai into their workflow. according to public information wimi hologram cloud is committed to cutting edge research and development in the field of artificial intelligence and constantly expands its application scope. it has excellent technical strength and rich experience in application scenarios. now generative ai is becoming a hot spot in the industry. wimi hologram cloud will use existing ai models and technical strength and use new aigc technology to empower various industries so as to provide more intelligent solutions and help vertical industries complete the development of digital intelligence so as to achieve comprehensive empowerment. the emergence of aigc is bringing disruptive changes to every industry leading all industries to an era of efficiency. it is foreseeable that aigc is both an important opportunity and an inevitable trend. with the continuous progress of artificial intelligence technology the capability and quality of aigc are also constantly improving. in the future the application scenarios will be more diversified which will bring more possibilities for all walks of life.

[TITLE_END] to support more analysis like this please join r tradingedge as well as r trading. analysis yesterday we hit 4900 like a brick wall and got rejected a lot of algorithmic selling from that point brought us lower. looking at today vs yesterday we can see that the call resistance still sits at 4900 it hasn t rolled up yet to 4950 or above. we want to see the roll up of call resistance for us to be more bullish. in fact after 4900 got rejected yesterday we can see that traders bought a fair bit of puts 0dte. on february expiration we can see calls on 5000 and 4950 got sold and puts got bought. so positioning bit worse but still bullish. money flows are strong. if we look 0dte we can see big walls at 4880 as 0dte call resitance and 4845 as 0dte put resistance. these will act as sticky strikes but obviously they are just 0dte so they can be broken by strong volume from gdp data. qqq positioning more or less as it was. call resistance still at 430 which will act as a wall. iwm we are seeing some selling of calls as bond yields push higher. note that positioning today will be subject to the gdp print. a big surprise in either direction will clearly impact the market as it will impact bond yields dollar and the chance of rate cuts. we showed yesterday that the probability of march rate cuts has been directly driving dollar price action and in turn the equity market. we can see from the chart below that the reduction in rate cuts being priced was what directly correlated to the equity sell off. vix is pretty much sleeping at this point so this is a good thing to watch as the number of rate cuts being priced and equity markets are moving inversely. furthermore tesla will weigh on nasdaq a bit today. the report wasn t great. pointing to lower volume is not what investors want to be hearing but that is mostly because their team is working on launch of next gen vehicle or so they say. i do think that we have to remember that the stock was trading at 260 at the start of the year. it s already down 27 on that. i do think tesla goes lower but i am not as pessimistic as other people on reddit and social media. a quick look at china because china announced more supportive measures this time for the property sector. call volumes on china are flying after the announcement of stimulus measures this week. we can see that below. i did look at the option profile for fxi and saw a fair bit of selling of puts at 21. positioning is looking much better. mainland investors aren t chasing this rally though but area actually selling it. whilst we can see more of a squeeze here and i am long china so i want to see that i do think we need to see mainland investor sentiment shift before we see sustainable rally forwards. along with the improved positioning on china we can see aud risk reversal points up. traders fully expecting 0.67 right now as stimulus in china helps australian trade. data lede ifo report for germany business climate was 85.2 lowest

tesla earnings. china call volumes are exploding after the news on stimulus. ger40 slightly lower rejected just above 16900 fell back to 16 810. slightly lower ahead of ecb meeting where lagarde expected to be somewhat hawkish bond yields slightly lwoer this morning ahead of gdp but mostly elevated oil was higher yesterday as us crude inventories showed a big decline much more than expected. that distorts supply demand imbalance in favour of higher prices. also we saw russian seabourne crude shipments drop to 7 week low. still oil price flat ahead of gdp numbers. forex eurusd flat ahead of ecb meeting and gdp numbers from us got rejected at 1.09 gbpusd flat ahead of gdp numbers from us at 1.273 audusd flat below 0.66. yesterday it pushed up then pared most of the gains as dollar

2024-01-25,2024-01-25 19:36:53,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",investing,one common mistake of a novice trader one common mistake of a novice trader [TITLE_END] let s imagine the mindset of beginners. beginners want to earn quickly a lot and with minimal effort. and most likely we know from our experience they will be quite fearful. so they will choose those instruments that are well known and have a good reputation. these will probably be stocks of companies such as google meta amazon apple. how will beginners add companies to their portfolio let s specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100 300 dollars. of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. this means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them. what is wrong with that the point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position. what does good or bad timing mean in investing for 10 15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times. but if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading it is very important to choose the right moment. because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more of course. for the sake of simplicity let s consider 2 companies meta and aapl. both of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading but you should not buy both companies now if you take them for a short term. the fact is that meta and aapl stocks are at their all time highs right now. they have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected. since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line. there will always come moments of correction. and if you buy their stocks now you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times. that s why it s important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly.

2024-01-26,2024-01-26 14:31:01,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",investing,booking holdings stock analysis booking holdings stock analysis [TITLE_END] hi everyone i hope you are all well. i want to share my thoughts on booking as a company since i think booking is interesting. if you re looking for a superficial analysis and don t like reading look elsewhere. this isn t a superficial analysis which is what is typically shared. i ll share why i think booking might be differentiated from major competitors like expedia and airbnb. i ll also do an overview of the economics of the business then write about the industry and competitors and estimate the intrinsic value. as i am sure all of you know this is just my thoughts so please do your own research. i hope i provide some insights and i welcome an exchange of ideas. company overview booking is an online travel agency . it is a parent company that holds a number of brands such as booking kayak rentalcars priceline agoda and opentable. as a whole booking provides reservation services for customers looking for accommodations flights rental cars taxis and restaurants. there is a lot interplay between these brands. booking categories their revenue as agency merchant advertising other revenue 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 agency $9 003 $6 663 $4 314 $10 117 $10 480 $9 714 $7 982 $6 527 $5 845 merchant $7 193 $3 696 $2 117 $3 830 $2 987 $1 891 $1 620 $1 450 $1 329 advertising other $894 $599 $365 $1 119 $1 060 $834 $713 $613 $410 total $17 090 $10 958 $6 796 $15 066 $14 527 $12 439 $10 314 $8 591 $7 584 booking mainly generates revenue on commissions. agency revenue is when booking makes a reservation for a customer but does not facilitate payment the supplier will follow up with the customer for payment. merchant revenue is when booking acts as a merchant i.e. collect payment and remits payment to supplier. bookings earns commission on both of these categories. merchant revenue is catching up and increasing its percentage as a proportion of total revenue and although this doesn t negatively impact booking in regards to its position in the industry it does negatively impact their margins. operating margins 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 42.2 40.5 37.92 28.18 36.48 36.7 35.48 9.28 22.78 we can see that as the merchant category increases as a proportion of sales operating margins are decreasing. merchant revenue incurs additional expenses. advertising other is revenue mainly earned by kayak for its meta search platform this platform lists hotel chains flights etc on its website. i am going to disregard this segment because google flights does the same thing so i am estimating no growth here. some people view google as a competitor to booking and they do compete against kayak. however google benefits booking s agency and merchant business since google refers a lot of people to bookings platforms. google is ultimately an advertising business they don t make reservations or facilitate payments. marketing expense as a of total revenue 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 35 34.6 32 32.9 34.1 36.2 35.4 35 booking spends a lot on marketing and a lot of this spend is performance marketing on google. room nights booked 2022 2021 2020 2019 896 591 355 845 what i like about this data is that room nights booked in 2022 is higher than 2019 which was the record prior to covid. room nights have been increasing significantly in geographical areas which has lower average daily rates compared to areas like europe and the u.s. this also impacts their margins. competitors bookings mix of room nights for hotels and alternative accommodation 2022 2021 2020 2019 hotels motels resorts 70 71 71 alternative 30 29 29 airbnb the way i am thinking about this is 70 of bookings accommodations are in hotels and motels and airbnb mainly generate revenue from homes holiday houses etc. this is only 30 of bookings business which they list as alternative. although these two companies compete i don t think it will affect booking if airbnb continues to grow since they don t specialise in hotel accommodations. i am curious to know your thoughts about this. website traffic expedia 88.68 website traffic in the u.s. airbnb 71.54 website traffic in the u.s booking 10.86 website traffic in the u.s most of bookings website traffic is concentrated in europe whereas expedia and airbnb is concentrated in the u.s. i believe this has other implications especially when i compare booking with expedia that has a business model that is almost identical. most of the hotel chains in the u.s are very popular marriott holiday inn hilton hampton inn and hyatt to name a few. they have their own loyalty programs and big marketing and merchandising campaigns and customers often seek these hotels out directly although they are listed on expedia as well. since they are popular they have bargaining power and can request lower commissions to be listed on an ota. since expedia is heavily concentrated in the united states this has an impact on their margins. most of bookings hotel suppliers are outside of the u.s. and these are often smaller independent chains that rely more heavily on an ota. expedia operating margins 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 10.2 3 29.4 8 7 6.6 i think this explains why expedia s margins are a lot lower than booking despite similar business models. industry ota industry estimates suggest it will grow to over $1 trillion at the end of 2030. it is currently at $521 billion. estimated growth is just over 10 . intrinsic value estimate historical data x200b 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 fcf $7 054 $5 913 $2 243 $456 $4 318 $4 882 $4 398 $3 694 percentage change 19.3 163.6 591 110 11.5 11 19 33.45 roic 53.47 43 12.3 3.37 29.61 26.67

and 6 in yrs 6 10 discount rate of 10 and terminal value of 20. the growth rates are estimated because of the industry growth projections and bookings position in the market. also the 5 year previous growth rates for booking was 8 which was the lowest compared to my 1 3 7 and 9 years growth rates so i went with that. 8 is a lower growth rate than the industry growth projections and i wanted to be conservative especially since the fcf in the current year is at record highs. i always like putting a lower growth rate in the latter half because it is a lot harder to estimate. the discount rate is high however my style has always been to make fewer bets for higher returns and i am happy being patient until those opportunities arrive. this gave me an intrinsic value of $4 296. i try and go a bit further to see if i can get a discount to intrinsic value. margin of safety price ranges 10 $3 867 20 $3 437 30 $3 007 40 $2 578 50 $2 148 x200b risk interest debt has been increasing over the past 10 years. covid really impacted the ota industry and who knows if another similar crises will occur i did not invest in this company i just wanted to share my thoughts. x200b

canada.. owned by li ft power for most lithium companies around the world they dig dozens if not hundreds of meters into the earth s crust to find this rock. not the one this man is holding. this specific rock not only contains some of the highest grade lithium around this rock could be picked up right off the ground. yes like any old pebble in fact there s over 158 400m2 area of land that is bursting with this rock. so much so there are kilometers of it just sitting on top of the earth. it s so large just look for yourself on google maps x200b you can see this lithium deposit from this aerial view. see those white specks stretching over 2 kilometers that stuff can power a tesla and it s there for the taking. this unique project in the northwest territories canada is called the yellowknife lithium project. discovered in the 1970 s but hidden from the world until today once owned by exxonmobil in the 80s it s sat dormant and relatively untouched for the last 36 years. until now. when a successful gold finder from the $47b newmont mining company francis macdonald stumbled on a major arbitrage in the lithium market. due to his experience in gold mining he knew you needed 500 000 1.5 million meters of drilling to start a gold project. and the costs are enormous. for copper mining it s 200 000 1 million meters of required drilling. for lithium it s only 50 000 meters of drilling . that means less money time and effort to find out how much metal is in the ground. not only that there are already over 536 active gold producing mines running right now. active producing lithium mines a paltry 54. that s not enough. at the moment there are 1. record breaking demand for electric vehicles ... and lithium ion batteries. plus 2. a looming lithium shortage to hit as early as 2025 according to cnbc. francis took his geology and mining knowledge and founded li ft power. the company is only two years old while potentially sitting on a fascinating lithium deposit in north america. li ft power trades publicly on the us otcqx lifff li ft s a company bursting with lithium potential literally coming out of the ground. x200b li ft currently is drilling to discover how much lithium is here why hasn t yellowknife been drilled for lithium if it could be one of the greatest deposits in north america extracting any resource from gold to copper to lithium takes time to permit and develop the mine site money to do so companies like exxonmobil and individuals barely touched yellowknife for almost a century as lithium wasn t as profitable to get out of the ground. only recently have ev sales picked up lithium prices soared and then stabilized and the demand for lithium ion batteries taken off. it s only now as we face geopolitical risks and coming lithium shortages does it finally makes sense to put more shovels into the ground. that s the opportunity li ft power and its founders see. over 50 of the outstanding shares of li ft power are owned by the founders and early investors. early li ft investors poured in as much as $15 million dollars each into the company to acquire the yellowknife project and start defining how much lithium is in the ground. that money hasn t gone to pay out bonuses or waste. francis the ceo is plowing most of the cash into fast tracking yellowknife by drilling to determine how much lithium is there. remember this deposit has lithium containing rock that can be seen on the surface. now it s drilling down 200 300 meters and determining how big this project really is. we re hitting on 80 90 of our drill holes the ceo says. meaning 80 90 of drill tests locate more lithium. by mid 2024 li ft should know how much lithium they re holding. when you hear about car companies partnering up with mines now ford pre purchased one third of the output of a lithium mine in 2022 gm invested over $650 million bucks into a lithium mine in 2020 volkswagen is seeking to create what former ceo herbert diess has called a full ecosystem of suppliers from lithium extraction to the assembly of batteries in spain we ll need 78 new mines by 2035 to accommodate total demand but few mines are under development and existing mines are not scaling up lithium production. also lithium mines take 10 years to bring online. so if the mine is not already under development it s too late. which is why massive shortfalls are already being predicted. under the best case scenario the lithium shortage in three years will be as much as the entire demand was in 2022. to avoid the impending crisis ev manufacturers are taking matters into their own hands. in a rare move they re getting involved in lithium mining itself. what s unfolding is an escalating no holds barred brawl for lithium supply. consider volvo which is talking with the biggest mining companies in the world about buying a stake in their operations. not for a profit but just to have access to lithium. volkswagen s ceo scott keogh echoes this sentiment we are not going to become a mining company. but certainly we will get significantly closer. or ford which pre purchased 33 of the lithium output of a new mine in nevada last year. a few months after that gm invested $650 million in a lithium mine also in nevada. gm director of purchasing tanya skilton predicts that the industry will be divided into winners and losers companies with minerals for electrified dreams will succeed. the rest are toast. it s after feasibility this type of investor interest really picks up both with the stock and the potential vendors who desperately need more high grade lithium. why once li ft discovers how much lithium they can get and the way to extract it economically companies and investors start watering at the mouth. an example is tesla was rumored to be in talks to buy sigma lithium the massive lithium project in south america for around $3 4 billion. that company kept updating their feasibility and reserve size to be bigger and bigger tesla was interested to pounce. how big is the potential lithium motherlode inside yellowknife note modelling a deposit has a lot of variables and risk. and that s the job of seasoned analysts to determine. tesla was interested in buying sigma lithium as mentioned. today sigma is a $4 billion dollar lithium company in brazil. their entire business centers around their one lithium project grota do cirilo. the mine s already up running and producing as they started working on it in 2012. sigma s grota do cirilo is estimated to hold between 85 and 100 million metric tonnes of lithium in their mine. what about yellowknife according to francis the ceo he and his team are more than halfway through drilling to determine the actual tonnage. sigma is further along and now producing up to $450 million in free cash flow from their lithium output. sigma s stock skyrocketed over 1 350 as lithium demand and prices soared of course past returns are no guarantee of future returns. x200b taking a further look lift s yellowknife lithium deposits are in yellow and sigma s groto do cirolo deposits are in green both at the same scale on these maps. x200b let s look at another major lithium discovery patriot battery metals... 2.5 years ago they were worth around $10m. today they re a $1.25 billion dollar company but haven t pulled an ounce of lithium out of the ground yet. patriot battery metals project is called corvette. and it s currently heralded as one of the largest lithium mining deposits in the americas. they show 109 million metric tonnes of lithium ore. the project is still years from producing lithium revenue worth over $1 billion they ve simply defined how much lithium they have in the ground. li ft power aims to have a resource estimate done in the next 8 months and will be able to share their final numbers. if 100 million metric tonnes proves correct li ft power could end up with a significant lithium deposit in the americas. the top 4 lithium projects in the americas are owned by billion dollar companies as of this writing one large owner albemarle is worth over $16 billion. they own multiple projects globally. take a look x200b yellowknife has the potential to surpass the size of these billion dollar sites including its neighbor patriot battery metals. meaning two of the largest deposits in north america are quietly tucked away in canada. yet at the moment canada is a rounding error on the total lithium producers in the world. x200b australia leads the pack in lithium production by a wide margin followed by members of the lithium triangle chile and argentina. then of course china. canada is not even at 3 while australia reigns at over 46 . it s not a shock if canada begins making strides higher especially in the mining space. canada is already a top 5 producer of uranium diamonds gold platinum titanium and other resource metals. mining is in its dna. in canada thanks to the ice age ending only 25 000 years ago the lithium deposits are easier to get to and not as damaged. the glaciers also polished the landscape making beautiful pristine deposits at the surface in areas like yellowknife. not only that many canadian suppliers are not affiliated with china china is a major geopolitical concern in the lithium space. a big reason being they got to the lithium first. their quest for more evs before global adoption meant they snatched up mines all over the world. x200b china itself produces only 17 of the world s raw lithium. but it has managed to wrap its tentacles around every corner of the lithium market. it even has the lithium refining market cornered 65 of the world s lithium chemicals are produced in china. for example australia produces about half of the world s raw lithium but it s almost all owned by china a chinese lithium company owns a large stake in greenbushes the australian lithium reserve that is the largest in the world the second largest lithium reserve in the world also in australia is underwritten by ganfeng lithium... a chinese company. nearly 60 of the world s known reserves of lithium can be found inside a triangle that intersects the borders of three countries chile argentina and bolivia. x200b the lithium triangle holds most of the lithium reserves and china owns a large chunk of the ganfeng lithium paid $4 billion to become the second largest shareholder in sqm the largest lithium producer in chile. and in 2021 chinese companies bought three major lithium mines in argentina in deals worth $1.3 billion. most countries are trying to get out from the stranglehold of china s grasp on the lithium market. china s main gig is that they own over 60 of the lithium processing capacity. bloomberg projects they own up to 80 . which is quite alarming that s on top of owning the actual lithium in the ground inside multiple countries. the battle for lithium comes down to access to the lithium ion batteries. that s why the us is also seeking alternative lithium supplies. we need more lithium ion batteries to power electric vehicles. an electric car battery has between 30 and 60 kilos of lithium. it s estimated that by 2034 the us alone will need 500 000 metric tons of unrefined lithium a year for ev production. that s more than the global supply was in 2020. and by 2030 albemarle the world s largest lithium producer is projecting that 3.7 m metric tonnes of lithium will be needed. x200b that s a lot of lithium needed by mid century some experts project evs will be nearly 100 of the market supply for vehicles. boston consulting group predicts electric battery powered vehicles will surpass combustion engine vehicle sales as soon as 2028. x200b ev demand has picked up in just the last two years whether you believe gas powered cars are on their way out or not there s no denying ev sales are shooting upwards at the moment. everywhere you turn in north america there s a tesla driving by. and the numbers in china are breaking new records if the u.s. meets its 2030 target there will be more than 48 million evs on the road in just seven years. but it s not just the us trading in gas for lithium powered electrics europeans just started buying a ton more evs in 2021. x200b ev sales have tripled in just three years. china beat other countries to the lithium punch early because they suck up more supply of evs than anyone. more evs on the road more lithium required. to create one singular lithium ion battery to power a tesla you must process 25 000 pounds of brine for the lithium more is needed. the international energy agency an organization that tracks world energy usage says demand for lithium is growing faster than demand for any other metal or mineral they estimate that the global demand for lithium will increase more than tenfold by 2030 and potentially 50 times greater by 2040. check out where the demand graph is at the moment x200b we re in the early stages of lithium demand meaning experts predict a near 4x increase in lithium demand. 73 of that today comes from evs. another block is energy storage. keith phillips ceo of piedmont lithium projects we need 40x more lithium by the end of this decade. that may be overstating but either way the supply crunch is set to begin as early as 2025. and the gap will only widen as time passes. x200b we need more lithium being produced. well there are large players out there. the biggest in the world own projects in the china heavy lithium triangle. however getting the product out of the ground and scaling it is a problem. the problem big time companies like albemarle aren t hard rock lithium mining they use a technique called brining. brining is a process where instead of chipping away at rock and pulling out the lithium brining pumps ungodly amounts of water into lithium deposits extracts the solution then dries out the water to get the lithium salt remaining. here s the issue the brining evaporating cycle takes 2 years to complete in hard rock lithium mining you can pull the product out and it s commercial ready 6 weeks later. yellowknife has hard rock lithium sitting on the surface ready to be processed. little to no water evaporating is required. you can t scale brining operations without more land and tonnes and tonnes of more water. in chile brining has caused severe droughts. in northern chile an entire river was dried out due to water extraction and evaporation. rivers and lakes have disappeared one local told the news. to meet soaring demand we need more hard rock lithium miners. and with many countries turning their backs on chinese operations... canada has another opportunity to shine in the mining space. the lithium project that could be at the center of it all it s called yellowknife as mentioned. a project you can see from google maps for yourself it s that obvious yellowknife s owned by li ft power a two year old lithium mining company. francis macdonald the ceo has put together an expert team with multiple geologists and environmental officers. x200b a top tier team for a top tier lithium asset. insiders own 50 of the outstanding shares currently the company is valued around $198 million as of this writing. they hold $18 million just in cash. the stock trades for a mere $4 under the ticker symbol otcmkts lifff. the goal is to continue to develop the yellowknife project to become one of the top deposits in not just the americas but also the world. insiders still own 50 of the stock and aren t selling. shares only went public in may 2023. lithium prices currently sit at multi year lows. as we see a supply crunch with demand skyrocketing there s no telling how long lithium prices will stay this low. this low lithium price will discourage new lithium miners to develop. meaning if competitors don t start now they won t be extracting any new lithium before 2030. that could exacerbate the supply problem even further. by then it s too late even if lithium prices rebound. an investor is better to position themselves before lithium prices go up again. . investing in li ft power at just $4 is an easy way to gain exposure to lithium but also enjoy watching the potential unfold. their next major milestone for investors is finishing their drilling in early 2024 then a feasibility study by mid 2025. consider li ft power as a potential value play in the lithium mining space as a bonus li ft power also owns four other projects in canada. cali acquired with yellowknife near the yukon border rupert located near the james bay region of quebec pontax located also near the james bay region moyenne accessed via helicopter also located in james bay all 4 of these bonus assets are in pre production. most funding is going towards yellowknife. x200b

to become a mining company. but certainly we will get significantly closer. or ford which pre purchased 33 of the lithium output of a new mine in nevada last year. a few months after that gm invested $650 million in a lithium mine also in nevada. gm director of purchasing tanya skilton predicts that the industry will be divided into winners and losers companies with minerals for electrified dreams will succeed. the rest are toast. it s after feasibility this type of investor interest really picks up both with the stock and the potential vendors who desperately need more high grade lithium. why once li ft discovers how much lithium they can get and the way to extract it economically companies and investors start watering at the mouth. an example is tesla was rumored to be in talks to buy sigma lithium the massive lithium project in south america for around $3 4 billion. that company kept updating their feasibility and reserve size to be bigger and bigger tesla was interested to pounce. how big is the potential lithium motherlode inside yellowknife note modelling a deposit has a lot of variables and risk. and that s the job of seasoned analysts to determine. tesla was interested in buying sigma lithium as mentioned. today sigma is a $4 billion dollar lithium company in brazil. their entire business centers around their one lithium project grota do cirilo. the mine s already up running and producing as they started working on it in 2012. sigma s grota do cirilo is estimated to hold between 85 and 100 million metric tonnes of lithium in their mine. what about yellowknife according to francis the ceo he and his team are more than halfway through drilling to determine the actual tonnage. sigma is further along and now producing up to $450 million in free cash flow from their lithium output. sigma s stock skyrocketed over 1 350 as lithium demand and prices soared of course past returns are no guarantee of future returns. x200b taking a further look lift s yellowknife lithium deposits are in yellow and sigma s groto do cirolo deposits are in green both at the same scale on these maps. x200b let s look at another major lithium discovery patriot battery metals... 2.5 years ago they were worth around $10m. today they re a $1.25 billion dollar company but haven t pulled an ounce of lithium out of the ground yet. patriot battery metals project is called corvette. and it s currently heralded as one of the largest lithium mining deposits in the americas. they show 109 million metric tonnes of lithium ore. the project is still years from producing lithium revenue worth over $1 billion they ve simply defined how much lithium they have in the ground. li ft power aims to have a resource estimate done in the next 8 months and will be able to share their final numbers. if 100 million metric tonnes proves correct li ft power could end up with a significant lithium deposit in the americas. the top 4 lithium projects in the americas are owned by billion dollar companies as of this writing one large owner albemarle is worth over $16 billion. they own multiple projects globally. take a look x200b yellowknife has the potential to surpass the size of these billion dollar sites including its neighbor patriot battery metals. meaning two of the largest deposits in north america are quietly tucked away in canada. yet at the moment canada is a rounding error on the total lithium producers in the world. x200b australia leads the pack in lithium production by a wide margin followed by members of the lithium triangle chile and argentina. then of course china. canada is not even at 3 while australia reigns at over 46 . it s not a shock if canada begins making strides higher especially in the mining space. canada is already a top 5 producer of uranium diamonds gold platinum titanium and other resource metals. mining is in its dna. in canada thanks to the ice age ending only 25 000 years ago the lithium deposits are easier to get to and not as damaged. the glaciers also polished the landscape making beautiful pristine deposits at the surface in areas like yellowknife. not only that many canadian suppliers are not affiliated with china china is a major geopolitical concern in the lithium space. a big reason being they got to the lithium first. their quest for more evs before global adoption meant they snatched up mines all over the world. x200b china itself produces only 17 of the world s raw lithium. but it has managed to wrap its tentacles around every corner of the lithium market. it even has the lithium refining market cornered 65 of the world s lithium chemicals are produced in china. for example australia produces about half of the world s raw lithium but it s almost all owned by china a chinese lithium company owns a large stake in greenbushes the australian lithium reserve that is the largest in the world the second largest lithium reserve in the world also in australia is underwritten by ganfeng lithium... a chinese company. nearly 60 of the world s known reserves of lithium can be found inside a triangle that intersects the borders of three countries chile argentina and bolivia. x200b the lithium triangle holds most of the lithium reserves and china owns a large chunk of the ganfeng lithium paid $4 billion to become the second largest shareholder in sqm the largest lithium producer in chile. and in 2021 chinese companies bought three major lithium mines in argentina in deals worth $1.3 billion. most countries are trying to get out from the stranglehold of china s grasp on the lithium market. china s main gig is that they own over 60 of the lithium processing capacity. bloomberg projects they own up to 80 . which is quite alarming that s on top of owning the actual lithium in the ground inside multiple countries. the battle for lithium comes down to access to the lithium ion batteries. that s why the us is also seeking alternative lithium supplies. we need more lithium ion batteries to power electric vehicles. an electric car battery has between 30 and 60 kilos of lithium. it s estimated that by 2034 the us alone will need 500 000 metric tons of unrefined lithium a year for ev production. that s more than the global supply was in 2020. and by 2030 albemarle the world s largest lithium producer is projecting that 3.7 m metric tonnes of lithium will be needed. x200b that s a lot of lithium needed by mid century some experts project evs will be nearly 100 of the market supply for vehicles. boston consulting group predicts electric battery powered vehicles will surpass combustion engine vehicle sales as soon as 2028. x200b ev demand has picked up in just the last two years whether you believe gas powered cars are on their way out or not there s no denying ev sales are shooting upwards at the moment. everywhere you turn in north america there s a tesla driving by. and the numbers in china are breaking new records if the u.s. meets its 2030 target there will be more than 48 million evs on the road in just seven years. but it s not just the us trading in gas for lithium powered electrics europeans just started buying a ton more evs in 2021. x200b ev sales have tripled in just three years. china beat other countries to the lithium punch early because they suck up more supply of evs than anyone. more evs on the road more lithium required. to create one singular lithium ion battery to power a tesla you must process 25 000 pounds of brine for the lithium more is needed. the international energy agency an organization that tracks world energy usage says demand for lithium is growing faster than demand for any other metal or mineral they estimate that the global demand for lithium will increase more than tenfold by 2030 and potentially 50 times greater by 2040. check out where the demand graph is at the moment x200b we re in the early stages of lithium demand meaning experts predict a near 4x increase in lithium demand. 73 of that today comes from evs. another block is energy storage. keith phillips ceo of piedmont lithium projects we need 40x more lithium by the end of this decade. that may be overstating but either way the supply crunch is set to begin as early as 2025. and the gap will only widen as time passes. x200b we need more lithium being produced. well there are large players out there. the biggest in the world own projects in the china heavy lithium triangle. however getting the product out of the ground and scaling it is a problem. the problem big time companies like albemarle aren t hard rock lithium mining they use a technique called brining. brining is a process where instead of chipping away at rock and pulling out the lithium brining pumps ungodly amounts of water into lithium deposits extracts the solution then dries out the water to get the lithium salt remaining. here s the issue the brining evaporating cycle takes 2 years to complete in hard rock lithium mining you can pull the product out and it s commercial ready 6 weeks later. yellowknife has hard rock lithium sitting on the surface ready to be processed. little to no water evaporating is required. you can t scale brining operations without more land and tonnes and tonnes of more water. in chile brining has caused severe droughts. in northern chile an entire river was dried out due to water extraction and evaporation. rivers and lakes have disappeared one local told the news. to meet soaring demand we need more hard rock lithium miners. and with many countries turning their backs on chinese operations... canada has another opportunity to shine in the mining space. the lithium project that could be at the center of it all it s called yellowknife as mentioned. a project you can see from google maps for yourself it s that obvious yellowknife s owned by li ft power a two year old lithium mining company. francis macdonald the ceo has put together an expert team with multiple geologists and environmental officers. x200b a top tier team for a top tier lithium asset. insiders own 50 of the outstanding shares currently the company is valued around $198 million as of this writing. they hold $18 million just in cash. the stock trades for a mere $4 under the ticker symbol otcmkts lifff. the goal is to continue to develop the yellowknife project to become one of the top deposits in not just the americas but also the world. insiders still own 50 of the stock and aren t selling. shares only went public in may 2023. lithium prices currently sit at multi year lows. as we see a supply crunch with demand skyrocketing there s no telling how long lithium prices will stay this low. this low lithium price will discourage new lithium miners to develop. meaning if competitors don t start now they won t be extracting any new lithium before 2030. that could exacerbate the supply problem even further. by then it s too late even if lithium prices rebound. an investor is better to position themselves before lithium prices go up again. . investing in li ft power at just $4 is an easy way to gain exposure to lithium but also enjoy watching the potential unfold. their next major milestone for investors is finishing their drilling in early 2024 then a feasibility study by mid 2025. consider li ft power as a potential value play in the lithium mining space as a bonus li ft power also owns four other projects in canada. cali acquired with yellowknife near the yukon border rupert located near the james bay region of quebec pontax located also near the james bay region moyenne accessed via helicopter also located in james bay all 4 of these bonus assets are in pre production. most funding is going towards yellowknife. x200b

[TITLE_END] analysis we broke 5000 in premarket which means that we are currently trading above the call resistance. premarket trading isn t the best indicator of true price action due to the lack of volume. so when the market opens we will want to see spx consolidate above the 5000 level. it will likely retest this level so we just need to see if it holds above. we can start to see some more call interest building at 5050 and 5100 now as we approach monthly opex. we can see that here and with a different visualisation here we have shown before that the money flows into spx reached new highs. here is a different visualisation of this from nomura which shows that asset managers are basically really really long on this market. look at the skew on the mag 7. very very strong not looking like any pullback right now on the big boys. money flows in spx remain strong we are seeing some signs of possible hedging by traders in qqq. the gamma is very very high again today which tells us that again volatility should be slightly surprised although we will have the cpi revisions released which will be interesting if they show some hawkish surprises. note the last revisions data did indeed lead to dollar strengthening and yields rising. if we do get that kind of move higher we will likely see some pullback as traders hedge going into cpi print next week. see the institutional research section to read about morgan stnaley s prediction for the cpi next week. iwm lastly trading above a key gamma level skew points higher on 1 month expiration and 1 year expiration. traders expect bond yields to fall and iwm to break higher. yes market positioning does still look bullish on this market but i do want to share with you an alternative analysis from goldman sachs here. goldman note that we are now seeing extremely bullish options activity in the collective mag 6 names. this is something that we have seen 5 other times in the post covid era . we note that if you look at forward returns after this occurrence the 2 4 week forward return is negative . we can see that in this graph below. gamma levels to watch plot these on your charting platform so you can track the price action against them. spx trading at 5013 these are the key gamma levels gamma level at 5025 my quant says max of the day expected to be 5031 5000 remains tech all resistance gamma level at 4975 below that my quant says expected min of the day if we go that low is 4965. that marks the lower bound of the expected trading range today and we can expect a bounce from here. qqq call resistance remains at 440 myq quant says upper trading bounce of today will be 436.95 gamma level at 436 too. 435 is where the 0dte call resistance is below spot key gamma level is at 430. below this my quant says min of the day expected to be 429. that d mark the bottom of the trading range if we were to fall that far. data lede us cpi revisions markets will be looking to inform their thesis for the timing of the first rate cut. this comes ahead of cpi next week. last time the 2022 revisions showed that inflation progress wasn t so great which made yields jump and the dollar jump. fed s logan speaks later

2024-02-09,2024-02-09 14:54:40,TSLA,Tesla,trading,09 02 premarket report everything i m watching and analysing in premarket as spx breaks 5k. 09 02 premarket report everything i m watching and analysing in premarket as spx breaks 5k. [TITLE_END] analysis we broke 5000 in premarket which means that we are currently trading above the call resistance. premarket trading isn t the best indicator of true price action due to the lack of volume. so when the market opens we will want to see spx consolidate above the 5000 level. it will likely retest this level so we just need to see if it holds above. we can start to see some more call interest building at 5050 and 5100 now as we approach monthly opex. we can see that here and with a different visualisation here we have shown before that the money flows into spx reached new highs. here is a different visualisation of this from nomura which shows that asset managers are basically really really long on this market. look at the skew on the mag 7. very very strong not looking like any pullback right now on the big boys. money flows in spx remain strong we are seeing some signs of possible hedging by traders in qqq. the gamma is very very high again today which tells us that again volatility should be slightly surprised although we will have the cpi revisions released which will be interesting if they show some hawkish surprises. note the last revisions data did indeed lead to dollar strengthening and yields rising. if we do get that kind of move higher we will likely see some pullback as traders hedge going into cpi print next week. see the institutional research section to read about morgan stnaley s prediction for the cpi next week. iwm lastly trading above a key gamma level skew points higher on 1 month expiration and 1 year expiration. traders expect bond yields to fall and iwm to break higher. yes market positioning does still look bullish on this market but i do want to share with you an alternative analysis from goldman sachs here. goldman note that we are now seeing extremely bullish options activity in the collective mag 6 names. this is something that we have seen 5 other times in the post covid era . we note that if you look at forward returns after this occurrence the 2 4 week forward return is negative . we can see that in this graph below. gamma levels to watch plot these on your charting platform so you can track the price action against them. spx trading at 5013 these are the key gamma levels gamma level at 5025 my quant says max of the day expected to be 5031 5000 remains tech all resistance gamma level at 4975 below that my quant says expected min of the day if we go that low is 4965. that marks the lower bound of the expected trading range today and we can expect a bounce from here. qqq call resistance remains at 440 myq quant says upper trading bounce of today will be 436.95 gamma level at 436 too. 435 is where the 0dte call resistance is below spot key gamma level is at 430. below this my quant says min of the day expected to be 429. that d mark the bottom of the trading range if we were to fall that far. data lede us cpi revisions markets will be looking to inform their thesis for the timing of the first rate cut. this comes ahead of cpi next week. last time the 2022 revisions showed that inflation progress wasn t so great which made yields jump and the dollar jump. fed s logan speaks later

2024-02-13,2024-02-13 15:28:31,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",investing,looking at historical data does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market looking at historical data does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market [TITLE_END] looking at historical data does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market i say that by looking at the data. for example. amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. that is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. also i have another example. nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. the margins are high but obviously companies like meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent gpu solutions to control costs and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. the same is looking at arm. arm which trades at like 150 x earnings or something crazy literally grows at like 28 percent. that means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity. then if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004 apple it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth a tiny market cap better leadership. this compared to the 2000 s investing environment or earlier is terrible yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want. it goes on and on. looking at palantir which trades at a crazy multiple or basically any software company yes it s possible to buy palantir or any stock and it triple but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words real investing seems to be literally impossible right now. even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline. and there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible fed reserve activity mainly due to qe pushing valuations to their highest levels ever. also do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios
2024-02-15,2024-02-15 16:50:18,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",pennystocks,$caud staking it s claim in the ad tech market $caud $caud staking it s claim in the ad tech market $caud [TITLE_END] collective audience is a media industry game changer its 47 february rally supports that thesis collective audience inc. is a media industry game changer in many respects. and investors are taking notice sending caud shares higher by over 47 since the start of february. however while the run is indeed impressive it s likely the precursor to even higher gains especially as caud continues to actively stake its claim in an audience based performance advertising and ad tech sector that s expected to reach $2.9 trillion over the next seven years. the magnitude of how significant a trillion dollar market potential is can t be under appreciated particularly at a time when the once thought of as impossible mission to become a billionaire has been scored by an ever growing number of people. many professional investors thought that a company reaching the trillion dollar market cap was a far stretch of optimism. but that s been breached too with alphabet amazon and nvidia all holding valuations closer to two trillion than one. the interesting part of what s happening in the investment world is that these valuations are being scored while everyone s watching. the issue however is that many people and investors only see what they want to see and ignore not always intentionally the most monumental changes in global business and lifestyle landscapes. collective audience targets massive ad tech market a shift deserving immediate attention is how artificial intelligence including the peripheries around it is disrupting the way companies do business. that disruption is more than excellent news for clients needing best in class services it also is for investors looking to exploit opportunities exposed by innovative companies like collective audience which are capitalizing on potentially massive revenue generating opportunities by being in the right sector with the right products at the right time. for a company like caud valued at roughly $16.06 million on wednesday earning just a tiny slice of the market potential can be transformative. but know this caud wants to collect more than just market leftovers. and they intend to succeed in its mission by leveraging a products and services portfolio arsenal that can support earning an impressive share of the opportunities targeted. to ensure staying on track caud has assembled a leadership team that includes a who s who list of best in industry overachievers that can turn sales ambitions into tangible revenues. the company s recently announced addition of as ceo complements that list. wall street knows him for all the right reasons. for investors who don t and are evaluating the caud value proposition pay attention because he may help to quickly close the disconnect between his company s assets potential and share price. there s plenty to appreciate in the bio above. but the biggest reason for investors to embrace his leadership is that he has a proven track record of making small companies bigger. in most cases substantially so. and now leading caud and alongside some of the world s brightest business minds history in that respect may repeat. in fact that s likely considering caud has captured one of the digital sector goat s and by doing so has positioned themselves to become one of the most dynamic and influential companies in its target markets. an innovative products and services arsenal that presumption supports the case that even after its impressive february run considerable earned value may still be neglected in its current market cap. missing from its current valuation goes well beyond overlooking its leadership team. in may also neglect to fairly appraise the value inherent to caud assets which already position the company to target its increasing market opportunities. more value should be applied after caud and a special purpose acquisition company that previously traded on nasdaq that held an over $64 million market cap. nearly 4x higher than caud s current. however as noted the valuation gap could close quickly a likely proposition after caud debuted on the nasdaq market in november 2023. that uplist could attract significant analyst attention. a bullish view could send caud stock prices soaring considering that only about 13.73 million shares are o s with roughly 83 of those tightly held by insiders and another 5.2 owned by institutional investors. that leaves a relatively small number of shares in the public float a consideration that can help fuel and sustain a rally. the bullish speculation is more than warranted especially by factoring companies needs for an ally like caud to help them make better use of their ad budgets and publishers needing to leverage expertise to more effectively and quickly monetize their content. keep in mind that while the ad tech sector is expected to reach trillion dollar levels in less than eight years it s already substantial estimated at $748 billion in revenue generating potential just three years ago. from there and with an expected cagr of 14.7 into the next decade the case for caud bulls gets appreciably stronger supported by a combined products and services platform specifically designed to identify convert and monetize the collective audience of leading brands and publishers. right space right strategy right assets those intrinsic abilities put caud in an enviable spot to grow bigger and faster than even the staunchest caud bulls might expect. that case is not purely speculative either. it s supported by caud s abilities to target lucrative opportunities alongside some of the world s largest companies including meta and those mentioned which rely almost exclusively on ad revenues for top and bottom line growth. that s not all. while the large caps may have the means to fend off potential problems in the competitive landscape thousands of other companies especially smaller ones don t have the financial or technical resources to keep pace with changes. their challenge can be significant value drivers for caud. the better news in that respect is that caud can provide services that others can t to fill soaring demand. industry competitors like the trade desk pubmatic and magnite as good as they are in their respective target markets certainly can t handle the entirety of the market demand. even factoring in the niche focused companies like digital turbine and doubleverify while it helps still leaves considerable revenues for the taking. caud intends to earn its rightful share. that s no coincidence. as a u.s. based provider of e commerce and digital customer acquisition solutions that simplify digital advertising its proof of concept and performance attracts the right eyes by being an innovative data driven end to end provider with solutions facilitating access to data for activating campaigns across multiple channels. its digital marketing business includes a holistic self serve adtech platform a proprietary data driven and an ai powered system that enables brands and agencies to advertise across thousands of the world s leading digital media and connected tv platforms. all of that s important. remember digital marketing is widely considered the optimal solution for companies to communicate with prospective and existing customers to create business and brand awareness. moreover its value extends because digital marketing provides an easy way for companies to get creative and stand out from competitors in congested markets. that s led to significant adtech spending with many companies targeting the customers time spent on social media platforms like tiktok and instagram. of course those apps target millions of users. however as large as they are other apps retail media and gaming environments add billions of additional viewers eyes. and caud wants to connect them to the right interest through retail media connected television and e commerce channels that generate specific metrics and attribution models. a caud valuation disconnect exposed with the tools and abilities in place to bring audience objectives to life quickly efficiently and effectively caud is not a sector player to ignore. the 47 february increase indicates many investors aren t. but clients are taking notice too. and that s the real value driver behind the investment proposition since it can lead to a further steepening of caud s revenue curve. thus using virtually any valuation model especially based on a sum of its parts calculus caud presents a compelling value investment proposition. while investors are apparently taking advantage of its $1.15 share price on wednesday these levels still present what many refer to as ground floor levels. but with momentum at its back bargain prices may not last much longer a premise supported by a new era of internet and consumer landscapes that make adtech and the facilitators behind the space like collective audience an invaluable and necessary competitive tool. $caud

possibilities of ai and it has also spawned the demand for stronger smarter and more efficient ai chips. in last year s wave of generative ai nvidia was the undisputed biggest winner. predictably ai applications are ubiquitous and have become a new battleground between chip giants. meta plans to launch a new ai chip artemisintelligence ial intelligence gold rush the chip war will burn more and more in 2024. to support the artificial intelligence business meta plans to deploy a new custom chip in its data center this year and meta plans to launch artemis of ai chips for model reasoning this year to reduce its reliance on nvidia chips. meta h as been improving its computing power to meet generative ai products in applications such as facebook instagram and whatsapp as well as hardware devices such as ray ban smart glasses. zuckerberg said last month that the company plans to have about 350 000 of nvidia s flagship h100 processors by the end of the year and with other suppliers meta will have 600 000 h100 equivalent computing power. amd microsoft makes a full preparation for ai chips in addition us chip giant amd recently raised its 2024 ai processor sales forecast by $1.5 billion to $3.5 billion. amd ceo zifeng su said on the conference call that its ai chip sales could exceed its current forecasts of $3.5 billion once more capacity starts in the second half of the year. microsoft which is betting on ai has also launched its first ai chip maia 100 to compete with nvidia s gpu and reduce its expensive reliance on nvidia. maia 100 using the 5nm process the number of transistors reaches 105 billion which can be used for large language model training and reasoning. the two chips are reportedly expected to go on sale in 2024. both custom chips power microsoft s azure data center and prepare for a future full of artificial intelligence. nadella said maia will first support microsoft s own ai applications and then to partners and customers. there is no doubt that demand for ai chips is extremely strong and most companies around the world are looking for alternatives to the nvidia h100. according to the latest forecast from market research firm gartner the ai chip market will grow 25.6 from the previous year to $67.1 billion by 2024. gartner the ai chip marketofexpected to be more than twice the size of 2023 by 2027 reaching $119.4 billion. wimi explores the value from the industrial chain definitely the outlook for ai chip demand is extremely promising. data shows as a leading ai vision enterprise wimi hologram cloud under the boom of artificial intelligence currently in semiconductor algorithm and holographic ar light field technology module and other core technology has strong strength and has developed its ai chip business to enterprise customers provide computer chip products and central processing algorithm and related services comprehensive solutions and software and semiconductor business. at present the new generation of artificial intelligence technology has given wimi a new role. wimi based on ai chip is no longer limited to command control but to carry out more image structure and big data analysis which requires cpu and other traditional chip architecture to meet the needs of ai applications. at the same time with the deepening of the industry wimiai chip technology has gradually expanded to the related scene. in terms of horizontal development ai vision is promoted to intelligent home commercial buildings intelligent security intelligent retail autonomous driving robots and other broader application scenarios. no doubt 2024 will be a year of strong chip growth and ai electrification energy transition etc. all need a large number of chip support. with its excellent technical strength and market performance wimi actively promotes the development and application of artificial intelligence technology and plays an important role in the era of artificial intelligence. with the acceleration of the global digital transformation wimi is expected to maintain its lead and drive the global semiconductor industry. to sum up in the past few years the global chip industry has been in a downturn with the entire industry oversupply and the pressure on chip inventory increasing. today the development of large models and generative artificial intelligence is significantly driving the growth of the intelligent computing power market and the various giants are driving the boom of the chip industry. however as the competition in the ai chip market intensifies it will be interesting to see who will emerge from the ai wave and how this important market will change in the future.

2024-03-22,2024-03-22 11:34:01,TSLA,Tesla,pennystocks,$allg european ev charging services provider with great potential $allg $allg european ev charging services provider with great potential $allg [TITLE_END] hi everyone yesterday allego nv closed at $0.85 coming from a low of $0.59 just a couple of days ago. i bought some shares yesterday because i believe it will climb above $1 in the short term and will move higher in the long term. here s why company overview allego nv provides and operates ev charging locations throughout europe. they have all kinds of chargers ranging from slow charging to ultrafast but their focus is fast charging on parking lots. they operate 34.000 charging points throughout europe. the stock is undervalued. in the us sentiment for ev related stocks is very bad. most ev stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. this resulted in a big sell off of anything related ev. but this company is not on the us market. it s a european company and the european market is totally different. in europe ev sales are still growing helped by legislation. although consumers are still reluctant to buy one big organisations are all switching to evs. most big companies or government organisations have strict co2 reduction goals and switching to evs is a quick win. these organisations have to install chargers on their parking lots and allego has been providing these since 2013. these big organisations will negotiate pricing agreements on the energy prices so the margins will be thin. but the big advantage is the charging needs on these parking lots are predictable and continuous. this was their main focus during the starting years of the company and a smart strategy they were able to build revenue and gain expertise with predictable income in a time when private ev ownership was still low. in short allego has a baseline steady stream of predictable revenue from partnerships with big organisations by providing charging solutions for their own fleet of cars. their focus in the last 3 years has been to partner with big companies to build charging stations on their parking lots to offer charging solutions to the public. they landed some big contracts burger kings europe . they are slowly shifting their strategy to offering public charging stations which make sense in 2024 when ev ownership is getting higher and still increasing in europe. on these public charging stations the charging hours and predictability will be lower but margins will be higher. in short allego has shifted very successfully to offering public charging locations on parking lots of businesses such as supermarkets restaurants and hotels. the company started in the netherlands which has been one of the front runners in ev adoption. bigger countries such as france and germany were slower to adopt evs but are catching up rapidly . in these countries there s a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time so allego is very quickly winning contracts all over europe. their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed allego to grow fast at the moment. there s not a lot of competition in europe some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand alone locations next to the major roads . in short allego is extremely well positioned to deploy new charging locations throughout europe at a rapid pace since there is hardly any real competitor in europe that does what they do. financially allego is in a reasonabe position. their 2023 revenue is up 28 from 2022 and is expected to grow another 30 in 2024. they are about to publish their full year results but i expect the total revenue to be around 185m in 2023 . their gross margins are pretty good and their operational ebitda will be around 35m . their total debt is 320m which is obviously quite high and their interest payments are too high compared to their revenue. but in 2023 they made several big investments and they landed some big contracts in exchange for equity. also their cash flow is improving so i expect them to continue into 2024 without increasing their debt. this will be a crucial turning point in their way towards profitability. in short allego has strong revenues and margins with good growth numbers. their debt is high and they should be careful not to increase it but they already made big investments in 2023 that should pay off in 2024. all in all allego is in pole position to becoming the biggest ev charging provider in europe. they have a smart strategy in place and lack competition. they are on their way to stopping the cash burn in 2024 and turning profitable in 2025. some macro economic developments are helping them grow such as strict european legislation. other macro economic developments may be unpredictable such as energy prices or energy net congestion. the stock price has fallen because of negative sentiment surrounding electric vehicles and this provides an excellent buying opportunity get yourself some of these shares in the $0.80 $0.85 price range on their 2023 full year results i think they will climb to $1 . let me know

[TITLE_END] hi r investing roughly 10 years ago there was a great discussion about i discussed my method trending value and that led to me sharing my results with many of you via a program i had written. well that program broke and remained dormant for years... until now. so what is trending value it s a method published by james o shaughnessey in his what works on wall street book. during decades of backtesting it generated over 21 annual returns with equal standard deviation to the total market. it generated a lot of discussion and lead to in my mind this method resonates the truest... far truer than those who advocate watching the check out lines at your grocery store to see which products are being purchased. the method summarizing is the following when you run a screen for stocks with good p e or p b what do you look for you find a stock with a p e multiple of 12. is this good is this bad neither and both without a frame of reference. o shaughnessey s method rates 6 key financial metrics for every stock against the whole market to come up with a cumulative value based score. those metrics are p e p b p fcf p s ev ebitda and shareholder yield which is dividend yield stock buyback yield . all 6 metrics are ranked 0 100 where 100 is the best ratio in the stock universe and 0 is the worst. the top 10 of stocks will typically have scores in the 420 range. they are undervalued relative to the rest of the market. however just because a stock is undervalued does not mean that it s a good buy. it could be facing legal action failing drug trials having a ceo that just went to jail or other event that can t be reflected in these numbers. that s where momentum comes into play. we take the top decile of stocks and reorder them by 6 month price momentum. invest equally in the top 25 hold for a year liquidate repeat. the companies you buy are undervalued and the market is rallying behind them. back testing while not a prediction of future results yielded a 21.2 average roi with this method. of course there s no screener that does this nor is there a way to even view shareholder yield in one location. when i started this 10 years back yes matlab. wrong tool for the job. thankfully chatgpt has turned even amateur hobbyist coders into useful contributors and a python version has been born. i ll post the results of today s run below. feel free to ask for a specific stock and i ll post the results of that ticker. keep in mind it is filtered to market cap $200m and the name of the method is trending value your growth stocks are going to be viewed very poorly. edit you ll occasionally see a value like 10000 for p e or another field. that means the value was either missing or negative. this is to artificially just kill that field for that ticker.

[TITLE_END] i m really impressed with meta s smart moves in virtual reality and their big picture thinking for the next decade. however their decision to add large language models to apps like instagram threads facebook and whatsapp has me scratching my head a bit. generally people hop onto these platforms to chat and get entertained not for heavy duty tasks like studying or research which are typical uses for llms. trying to do homework or deep dives into topics on a buzzing social media site that sounds pretty distracting. i think meta could really hit it out of the park if they used llms to boost their advertising game instead. imagine an llm that helps advertisers craft killer campaigns or dig deeper into understanding their audiences. sort of like palantir s software of gathering data and using an llm to sort it and understand it better but with consumers and their buying habits. that could really amp up what meta offers to businesses and drive their growth much more effectively. i still think meta is a big buy since their forward pe is in the 20 s and mark zuckerberg has a great vision for the company besides this move solid buy. if anyone disagrees with me please let me know

[TITLE_END] i have made many posts about oust and i have made good money on all of them. i will try and make a mega post here for why you should be buying shares of oust and holding till 2030 or later. 1. oust just joined the russell 3000 look on page 4 here 2. oust gives 0 fucks about pr they almost never drop it good or bad. 3. oust is everywhere in all fields from cave exploring to driving a tractor tank yes a fucking tank we are proud to announce our strategic expansion into the military markets of norway and sweden. how long before we are in the u.s. military all links below have videos you should watch. we see you. you take the bus or train we got you. how lidar and ai interact with a human. i would watch a whole move done like this. i found this crazy to think about but he is not wrong watch the video. would you rather have cameras watching you and recording your looks or a computer image that tracks everything and everyone and not race based. oh you ski or snowboard we got you. oh you like trees and forest stuff we got you. oh you recycle we got you. oh you got boats we got you. oh you want to go caving in the ice in a volcano or just under ground we got you. oh you got a farm we got you. oh you got a warehouse we got you. oh you drive trucks we got you. if you made it this far i left the biggest and best for last you ever leave your house and get on any road if so we got you. if you don t know whats coming you will get left behind like trash. most or the world will start buying oust in about 3 5 years when it is well over 100 a share and i will be on to my next move years ahead of the random people who know nothing of how lidar is going to change our lives forever. 4. the ceo is awesome at what he does he also keeps buying shares he also doesn t pay himself like an asshole so when he buys share it means a lot more then lets say elon musk buying some tsla. 5. now that oust is in the russell 3000 every month lots of big mm funds will be buying oust by buying the russell 3000 and etfs. now on to a little rant. if i can tell you 1 thing for 2024 it is buy oust while you still can i don t see this under $20.00 for more than a week or two three tops. i may not know shit about stocks like goog and amzn but i know oust and i know it well. iykyk. stay chill and keep buying p.s. if you want to see my proof look at my older posts. here is a pic of my last oust trade.

2024-06-11,2024-06-11 01:47:25,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",investing,fiverr an unfairly beaten down pandemic stock an investment thesis for what currently looks like a contrarian bet. fiverr an unfairly beaten down pandemic stock an investment thesis for what currently looks like a contrarian bet. [TITLE_END] context a lot of pandemic era stocks lacked basic unit economics and were found out when the funding stopped and subsequently collapsed. some had network effects unit economics but needed to get fit some have righted their mid pandemic wrongs with clear turnaround value creation plans and been rewarded and some have righted the wrongs but not yet been rewarded. i think fiverr sits in this latter category. fiverr is a leading freelance marketplace which connects businesses with freelancers offering a wide range of services. about the company founded in 2010 by micha kaufman and shai winiger in tel aviv fiverr operates a two sided marketplace matching small businesses with freelancers. with approximately 700 employees fiverr is listed on the new york stock exchange and had a market cap of just under $1 billion in june 2024 down from about $11 billion during the covid 19 pandemic. problem statement fiverr solves fiverr transforms the opaque and inefficient process of hiring freelancers into a modern user friendly e commerce experience. unique selling proposition fiverr offers an easy to use platform where people can buy and sell small services for a flat starting fee. the platform boasts a comprehensive catalogue of services and well vetted freelancers. potential sources of network effects buyers around 4 million buyers with approximately 65 of core marketplace revenue from repeat buyers indicating sustained user engagement. service categories over 700 freelance service categories including recent additions like ai content and development. gigs range from $5 to $50 000. freelancers approximately 400 000 active freelance sellers. investment thesis star company fiverr operates in a profitable and growing market niche with growth exceeding 10 per year. it is a leader in its niche matching freelancers to smaller smes effectively. this makes it a star company . reasons why i think the stock will rise 1. overly beaten down tech stock fiverr has seen its share price decline by over 90 from its february 2021 peak. this significant drop which has also recently been exacerbated by the geopolitical concerns in israel and palestine and the disruptive impact of ai on its business is a common trend among tech stocks that were covid 19 beneficiaries. what seems to have been overlooked is fiverr retains a very viable and growing business post pandemic. 2. shift to profitability and cash generation fiverr s growth has slowed to approximately 10 year over year as it has pivoted its focus towards profitability and cash generation addressing investor demand for a focus on fundamentals. this strategic shift is reflected in improved bottom line results including free cash flow and earnings per share underpinned by key performance indicators like higher average ticket sizes and growing gross margins. 3. attractive valuation metrics following recent share price pressures fiverr currently trades at a 2024 forecast earnings enterprise value multiple that is attractive given its 10 growth rate and acceleration in key value creation metrics including eps fcf per share and return on invested capital . 4. ai concerns appear overblown investors are concerned ai will disrupt the services provided by freelancers on fiverr s platform but fiverr s q1 2024 results exceeded expectations leading to raised guidance for the full year. management has highlighted the net positive impact of ai on the business. 5. stable take rate and financial resilience fiverr s take rate remains stable at 30 it has a $304m net cash position and the company is free cash flow positive providing significant financial resilience. i.e. it has gotten beyond default alive . 6. dynamic macro environment while the macroeconomic environment remains challenging with constrained budgets in large enterprises and financial pressures on small businesses fiverr s high exposure to smaller businesses positions revenues to rebound quickly as conditions improve. 7. share buyback program in may 2024 fiverr initiated a $100 million share buyback program reflecting management s belief that the stock is undervalued. they are confident in their cash position and free cash flow generation to support this initiative. 8. large short float the short float was around 10 as of june 2024 indicating the possibility of large upwards price moves if sentiment on the stock changes as i think it should. overall fiverr s strategic focus on profitability robust financial health and proactive management of market challenges make it a compelling investment opportunity. things i don t like about the stock 1. share based compensation the level of share based compensation appears excessive and results in significant dilution. deducting sbc from free cash flow results in a near zero number meaning free cash flow per share is not trending up as quickly as desired. 2. ai cannibalization threat ai has the potential to cannibalize certain services offered on fiverr such as logo design and article writing which could impact revenue. 3. buyer trends while the number of buyers has been declining this has been offset by an increase in the average purchase price. this trend is concerning and needs to be monitored. overall looks like a decent buy at current prices. it currently trades at $24.5. analyst expectations are $26 on the low end and $45 at the high. my target is late $30s i placed a limit buy order at $24.5 which filled last night. at the same time i also took a position in upwork which has the same business model but is focussed on larger customers and is perhaps better equipped for ai implementation type services. $fvrr $fvrr

2024-06-19,2024-06-19 03:01:44,TSLA,Tesla,investing,selling nvda with $1m gains selling nvda with $1m gains [TITLE_END] i ve decided i m going to sell a portion of my nvidia stock once i hit $1million profit. as of close today i need an additional 22 increase to hit this threshold so it will likely happen before the end of the month or by the end of summer if things slow down correct. a little back story i bought my first shares in feb 2017 for $2.77 and again in october for $4.86. i ve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because i thought gpus would be needed for self driving cars. little did i know the ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world. my total cost basis is $34k and i m sitting right around $850k. gains are around 2600 which is insane. i still have more conviction that ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so i m a bit torn on actually selling any of it. if i sold all the other years people told me nvidia had mooned well i wouldn t be sitting on the gains i have today. my gut is telling me to only sell 1 3 of my holding but i have no idea where else to rotate this into. i m also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0 which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true fatfire setup. as with any compounding interest once the snowball gets to this point smaller 2 5 moves really move the needle . anyways just want to share this with someone since i can t really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship. it s anyone s real guess what will happen with nvidia in the future so i can t imagine anyone can persuade me one way or another on this trade. i ve experienced similar gains on tesla but failed to sell at the top and now only have a portion of my gains on that stock so i know when a bubble feels like a bubble and this is definitely in that territory now.

out for awhile and here it is. as always please feel free to suggest any companies you want me to check out kulr technology group inc. $kulr market cap 66m company overview kulr technology group develops and commercializes thermal management technologies for electronics batteries and other components. their products serve markets such as electric vehicles energy storage battery recycling transportation cloud computing and 5g communication devices. company highlights kulr had a solid 2023 with a 146 revenue increase to $9.8 million and a customer base that grew from 36 to 53. this growth shows rising demand for their tech. looking at q1 2024 revenue was steady at $1.75 million. what stands out though is the 769 jump in contract services revenue to $1.13 million indicating a strong demand for their specialized services. they more than doubled their revenue generating customers which is a promising sign. they did see gross margins drop to 29 but they managed to cut sg a expenses significantly and almost halved their r d expenses. one of the most compelling aspects of kulr is their partnerships. they secured a $1 million order from h55 for electric aviation applications and are working with nanoracks for space applications. kulr is also developing next gen battery solutions for the u.s. army. management often mentions that they have significant partnerships with large companies although many are under ndas. for example they hinted at the potential use of their safecase in apple stores and amazon prime shipments showing their broad market reach. kulr has also launched an online marketplace for their safecase and safesleeve products approved by the u.s. department of transportation and accepted by ups for battery transport. they ve delivered power cell batteries for ai enabled drone missions in ukraine and customized battery solutions for the u.s. army to enhance tactical operations. cematrix corporation $ctxxf $cvx.v market cap 63m company overview cematrix corporation based in calgary canada produces advanced cellular concrete products for infrastructure industrial energy and commercial markets across north america. their solutions are used for lightweight fill insulation and grouting applications. company highlights 2023 was a big year for cematrix as it was their first year of profitability. revenue jumped to $53.3 million from $29 million in 2022 a clear indicator that demand for their products is on the rise. gross profit also saw a solid increase to $11.9 million up from $2.5 million the previous year showing their effective cost management. in q1 2024 the company continued to perform well. they reported $8.4 million in revenue an improvement from $7.2 million in q1 2023. what is important though is that their gross margin saw a juicy increase reaching $2.6 million compared to just $746 000 in the same quarter last year. this shows they are scaling operations efficiently while managing costs. their cellular concrete products are particularly impressive for their high strength to weight ratio resistance to hydrocarbons and durability against freeze thaw cycles. these features make them ideal for applications like road construction and utility insulation. for example the resistance to hydrocarbons ensures stability even when exposed to oil or gas spills which is crucial for long term infrastructure projects. the company operates through three subsidiaries cematrix inc mixonsite usa inc and pacific international grout company. this structure allows them to manage and scale operations efficiently across north america. additionally they have received approvals from multiple transportation authorities which shows their credibility. some positive client testimonials display their effectiveness in reducing project costs and timelines. for example one client reported saving over 5 000 man hours and accelerating their schedule by seven weeks due to cematrix s efficient product application. american salars lithium inc. $asalf $usli.cn market cap 7m company overview american salars lithium inc. focuses on exploring and developing high value battery metals projects catering to the growing electric vehicle market. company highlights american salars stood out to me due to its resource rich projects and strategic acquisitions. their candela ii lithium brine project in argentina holds an inferred resource of 457 000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent positioning them well to meet the rising lithium demand from the ev sector over the next few years. the recent acquisition of the pocitos 1 lithium salar project along with pocitos 2 adds an inferred resource of 760 000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent. the proximity to essential infrastructure enhances the project s value. moreover completing the environmental and social baseline report for pocitos 1 and 2 is a significant step towards securing production permits adding credibility to the project. their blackrock south lithium brine project in nevada is another asset worth noting. its location near the tesla gigafactory could open doors for future partnerships and logistical advantages. financially the company raised $844 999 in april 2024 and $580 000 in may 2024 through private placements. these funds are allocated for advancing exploration at candela ii demonstrating their commitment to developing this project. new leadership has brought in experienced professionals. ceo robert nick horsley with over 19 years in finance and m a and cfo daryn gordon a mining sector expert bring valuable expertise to the company. a nice bonus is that the company maintains a lean capital structure with just 23 million shares outstanding suggesting potential for significant upside. in terms of technology their work at the university of melbourne using ekosolve dle technology is impressive. they managed a 94.9 extraction efficiency and produced lithium carbonate with 99.8 purity. this breakthrough could really boost their production capabilities and set them apart. if you are reading this your a real one so suggest a ticker and if it is actually good i will post my thoughts on it in a future post. ty $kulr $ctxxf $cvx $asalf $usli

2024-07-03,2024-07-03 20:30:33,TSLA,Tesla,investing,tesla set for a new bull run as deliveries turn around and energy storage powers the ai era tesla set for a new bull run as deliveries turn around and energy storage powers the ai era [TITLE_END] whenever investors are disappointed with tesla elon musk surprises short sellers with a big move. on tuesday tesla posted stronger than expected q2 deliveries hinting at a turning point for weak demand with an upside in q3 deliveries. additionally energy storage deployments doubled quarter over quarter potentially helping to meet the vast electricity demand that comes with ai. these factors are enough to bring in a substantial influx of tesla bulls. thanks to these developments tesla surged over 10 on tuesday with its market value reaching $737.5 billion maintaining a six day rally and breaking another resistance level which is always a bullish sign. from april s low tesla shares are now up 67 . q2 deliveries slightly exceed expectations amid record june deliveries from chinese ev makers zero interest car purchases expected to drive crazy q3 demand according to tesla s delivery data released on tuesday the company delivered 440 000 new vehicles in q2 down 4.8 year over year but up 15 quarter over quarter and better than the market s expectation of 439 300 vehicles. the total production in q2 was about 411 000 cars resulting in a delivery production gap of 33 000 cars compared to 46 000 cars in the previous quarter . tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of german factories and the red sea conflict which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short term supply struggles to meet demand which is obviously more exciting than excess supply. considering that chinese ev makers such as nio zeekr and leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in june this implies a significant recovery in demand for tesla. the company also launched a major campaign on monday introducing five year zero interest financing for model 3 y and other preferential policies. specifically users who place an order before and including july 31 can avail themselves of a no down payment deal with an initial down payment of 79 900 yuan the daily installment for the model 3 rwd and long range awd will be as low as 85 yuan and 107 yuan respectively while the model y rwd and long range will be as low as 95 yuan and 118 yuan per day. users who make a down payment of 45 900 yuan can opt for a five year low interest plan . the chinese market accounts for about 22.5 of tesla s revenue and if this measure is implemented in other countries in the future it would indeed be a massive move. this also adds a new narrative for tesla s q3 growth. energy storage deployment doubles benefitting from ai era both nvidia ceo jensen huang and openai ceo sam altman have pointed out that the future development of artificial intelligence is closely related to energy and storage. while tesla s ai business has yet to show tangible benefits its energy storage business is poised to become a pillar of ai in the future. tesla reported that it deployed 9.4 gwh of energy storage products in q2 setting a new record for quarterly deployment more than double the 4 gwh in q1 and the company s energy storage deployments in the first half of the year almost matched the total for last year. morgan stanley analyst adam jonas praised as gen ai acceleration spurs a multigenerational increase in energy demand electricity generation and data center investment we believe investors will begin to pay more attention to tesla energy which we value at $36 per tesla share as the business is uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the u.s. electric grid accelerated by the ai boom.

2024-07-11,2024-07-11 03:31:49,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,nike is a bargain right now nike is a bargain right now [TITLE_END] right now these prices are an absolute fire sale. maybe i missed the part where people are going to stop buying nike worldwide. apparely nike has less going for it than it did in 2018 i mean just look at this chart below that covers 10 years you have a volume read of 129 996 982 on june 28th. right now the markets are highly infactuated with tech stocks and things like tsla or pltr. something boring like nike is far from the excitement anyone is looking for as new ath s are being made every day on qqq or spy. theres nothing sexy about it at all. this is where the best prices can be obtained. no one wants the stock. so few people want the stock that they are willing to actually sell it at prices first seen may 25th 2018. even in 2020 with a full blown pandemic breaking out with unknown consequences only saw nike hang out below this price for a whopping 7 trading days. lil trip down and v shape recovery. even from a pure volume only perspective the following shows some interesting things the lowest volume day is about 15.95m for any day since the big drop. the volume on the day of the big drop is unprecedented. the 2nd highest volume day in the last decade was 12 23 2015. hilariously almost around the same price the high of that day back then was 68.20 and was a new all time high. the difference with large volume down here is its the opposite. large amounts of demand are showing up down here. in the past the big volume was correlated with being near big highs. but nike wasnt even near its high right before it dropped either. so what i would say is that finding a bottom is a matter of flushing people out. you gotta get to that point where even the most committed person who would have a 1 chance of selling pre earnings is now ready to and currently selling. thats probably going on and we couldn t sport such volume down here if there wasn t some equal demand. the price has not moved much. you have a high there of 79.05 and we are down to about 72 now. lets just look at the actual income here over the last 10 years the revenue is only going up. even if the company is faltering so to speak these prices are far from connected to the reality of actual income. check out the p e below even right here you can see that right now nike is sporting a p e that looks to be just over 20. but its actually even lower and this chart is delayed the last time the p e was under 18.30 was nov of 2011... now heres what i do know. alot of fund managers are going to be looking at these beautiful pictures over the coming weeks months they are going to potentially sell some of those wildly running high stocks. then they will be sitting on some cash they need to find another play for. all of a sudden seemingly out of nowhere on your favorite stock channel all the analysts will be upgrading nike. show hosts and guests will be talking about how the stock is too cheap and all that fun fancy stuff they do after they bought the ol dippity skippity. they are going to have to do something with the money. they will see nike. i doubt they will just pass it up. since the fed hasnt cut rates yet theres nothing to really worry about. even when that happens markets should run a good 3 5 further before they tap out from whatever caused the fed to cut in the first place. now lastly what brought me to this trade idea at all adobe. how did adobe lead you to see something in nike i remember 2022. in 2022 there was a big gap down and this brought adobe to prices not 1st achieved since sept of 2018. i passed this one up. i let the fear keep me out of the trade. surely everyone who was selling was correct. obviously thats the crowd that always wins. since we are dealing with panic lets get up close and examine how the panic works the day of panic was mid sept and a bottom was put in over the next two weeks. it did however fight against going higher. you can see that in those micro higher lows leading into mid nov where it said goodbye to those lows permenantly. so quite clearly any attempts to make the stock run in the near term should be expected to be stamped out. espeically if we see a run back up to 78. it will probably have to retest its low whatever it is a couple of times over the coming months. quite clearly those retests whenever they happen should end higher on that day as they did with adobe there. that would be a sign of people buying the dip 10 10. it won t happen overnight but i do think the stock could fill its gap within the next 3 4 months. even if things get bad around the election period nike already got the business. tldr everyone hates nike so you should love it long time. thats all you really need to know.

2024-07-12,2024-07-12 16:42:07,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,how this door handle cost tesla half of my investment how this door handle cost tesla half of my investment [TITLE_END] today i arrived in bangkok with my girlfriend and ordered us to grab to get us to the hotel. i ve heard about byd before and that it s the chinese tesla but i d never expected to be driven in one of those cars for $2.63 through the midst of bangkok traffic for over 30 minutes. if you take a look at the design features and changes tesla s made over the last couple of years the companies beginning and elon musk of course it s obvious that they re trying to revolutionize the electric vehicle market with features like the yoke steering wheel the outer door handles and much much more. however if you look at the company byd how cheap they are producing their vehicles how amazing the design and the quality is in general you won t be able not to be amazed what china s done in that regard as well. one thing that struck me the most is the inner door handle... sounds weird but think about it how either unnatural or unnecessarily cumbersome are the inner handles of car doors either you have to pull the handle with one arm and push the door with the other handle or you bend your fingers in an unnatural angle to the side pulling in a curve to push the door open with your elbow. this might not be one of the most important topics when talking about a car and most people probably never thought of this as a problem or inconvenient but if you ve read the book atomic habits you might know where i m going with this. james clear at one point goes into detail about a racing bike team that improved every single little detail in their lifes to get every little advantage over the competition they could get. needless to say that after dozens of little improvements they became impressively successful making history for their country in this sport. i believe the same to be true for companies their culture their product and their team. and in the case of byd it definitely applies in a bunch of cases just like it did with tesla a couple of years ago . i ve been an investor in tesla since 2016 because i believed in the product and elon musk and made good money owning the stock however with tesla becoming being a blue chip stock not a growth stock anymore the percentage gain is going to be limited compared to byd which is until now rarely represented in the western world compared to tesla. tesla s got a market cap of 839.59 billion vs byd being at 96.16 billion which would mean byd has about an 8x to go until it catches up with tesla. and i m expecting higher prices on tesla too... when i talked to a friend at mercedes a couple of days ago he told me that china s investing so much money into the research of electric vehicles and the development of batteries that many european projects and car companies already gave up as they don t have the funding and resources provided by the chinese government. seeing how china s developed over the last 10 20 years and investments into modern technology they ve already passed by most western countries if they keep that trajectory going they ll be miles ahead 10 years from now. what do you think

2024-07-23,2024-07-23 21:30:29,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,deep dive into match group $mtch deep dive into match group $mtch [TITLE_END] 1.0 introduction match group is a company that continues to benefit from the society in which we live. the best way to introduce it is by sharing the apps brands it owns tinder hinge match meetic plenty of fish pairs azar hakuna and many more. the estimate is it has 50 market share in the u.s. and impressive profitability. here s its revenue and operating margin over time 2019 $2.1b 2020 $2.4b 2021 $3.0b 2022 $3.2b 2023 $3.4b there are two key points 1. this is a resilient business regardless if there s a pandemic or inflation there is always demand for connecting with another human being. 2. the operating margin has decreased at first glance this might seem concerning and you might wonder is this a trend the lower margin is caused by the management s decision to increase the r d expense significantly . this is expected to generate value in the future by introducing new products or new features as part of the existing products. however it is clear that the the current margin decrease is the outcome of a conscious management decision and is not caused by outside pressure. if the additional r d expense isn t adding value the management will reverse it which will bring its old profitability back. with this in mind i don t see any reason why the operating profitability would further decrease. 2.0 the worrisome society 2.1 the world is changing and the internet has a significant impact on how couples meet. based on a survey more than 50 of the couples have met online. this number has doubled over the last decade meaning the number of dating app users has increased . this doesn t come as a surprise but given that the younger generations are tech savvy i don t think we ve reached the peak . 2.2 not only that but the new generations are using more apps . based on match group s investor presentation back in january 2023 the average number of apps used by individuals under 35 was 4.3 . i would not be surprised if this widens further. 2.3 lastly there are fewer marriages meaning the apps are being used for a longer period of time . to summarize we have more users using more dating apps and for much longer . 3.0 the biggest concern competition of course every company has competition. given the market share it seems as if match group is winning this battle by a wide margin. being the biggest fish in the sea it can create the biggest network effect. the more people use an app the higher the value it generates for its users. the biggest concern that many have is meta. as facebook and instagram are dominating worldwide in theory these apps should be able to capture a large portion of the market quickly. however the reality is different 1. facebook dating was launched back in 2019 and it hasn t been a huge success. 2. facebook was founded back in 2004 . it has been two decades and mark zuckerberg has now focused on the metaverse. it is quite clear that targeting this market isn t a priority for meta at this very moment. it doesn t mean it will never be but the chances seem quite slim. 4.0 valuation based on my assumptions the fair value of the company is $14 billion slightly above the current share price of $34. the two key assumptions i have are 1. revenue growth of 54 over the next decade i think this is fairly conservative. the change in demographics combined with price increases makes this easily achievable. 2. operating margin of 26 this is below their historical average and assumes the management continues with the current level of r d. here s how the valuation changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth over the next decade and the operating margin revenue operating margin 26 28 30 cagr 54 $39 $43 $47 4.4 75 $44 $49 $54 5.8 100 $51 $56 $61 7.2 as i m writing this the share price is $34. if the company grows its revenue at 4 cagr the market expects its profitability to decrease below 26 . if the profitability remains at 26 the market expects the revenue to grow below 4 year. based on the analysis above i don t see data that supports any of the two scenarios above. i hope you enjoyed this post feel free to share your thoughts.

push for electric vehicles and renewable energy infrastructure significantly boosts copper demand. copper prices have risen approximately 6.54 since the beginning of 2024. analysts predict copper prices could reach $11 000 per metric ton by the end of 2024 driven by increased demand and potential supply constraints. the stock market is facing uncertainty with turbulent days ahead. tesla s recent missed earnings demonstrate how even major players can experience corrections and return to more expected levels. some experts suggest that the market may be undergoing a shift. while the exchanges might be fluctuating it could be wise to take a cautious approach and consider safer investments. however this doesn t mean you should only invest in assets with low potential growth. you might consider exploring small cap but promising companies as well as mining exploration firms with significant potential. these investments could offer opportunities for growth while still managing risk. what commodity should you look after while gold is here and represents one of the safest commodities in the world another one is emerging as a top asset. it is not silver but copper. why copper is essential for the modern world playing a crucial role in various industries due to its excellent electrical conductivity and thermal properties. copper is a critical component in the production of electrical wiring electronics and renewable energy systems including solar panels and wind turbines. as the world transitions to greener energy sources the demand for copper is expected to soar. the push for electric vehicles is another major driver as each ev requires significantly more copper than a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle. additionally the expansion of 5g networks and increasing urbanization are set to further boost copper demand. copper has experienced a notable price increase over the past six months gaining approximately 6.54 since the beginning of 2024. this rise is attributed to growing demand from sectors like electric vehicles renewable energy infrastructure and general electronics all of which heavily rely on copper due to its superior electrical conductivity and thermal properties . looking ahead the outlook for copper remains optimistic. analysts predict that copper prices could continue to climb potentially reaching $11 000 per metric ton by the end of 2024. this anticipated growth is driven by an expected increase in global demand particularly from green energy initiatives and infrastructure projects. additionally potential supply constraints from major copper producing regions like chile and peru could further tighten the market supporting higher prices . introducing world copper world copper ltd. headquartered in vancouver bc is a canadian resource company specializing in the exploration and development of significant copper porphyry projects. the company s primary assets include the zonia project in arizona and the escalones project in chile. world copper also aims to capitalize on these assets by continuing to explore and expand the known mineralization leveraging its experienced team and strategic positioning in copper rich regions. the company is also exploring additional opportunities in the u.s. aligning with governmental initiatives recognizing copper as a critical metal further enhancing its portfolio s growth potential . zonia copper project the zonia copper project located in arizona is a significant venture managed by world copper ltd. this project includes a historically productive open pit copper mine with a substantial resource estimate that underscores its economic potential. the region s rich mineral deposits make the site an important focus for further exploration and development efforts. recent developments world copper recently announced a new discovery within the zonia copper project highlighting the potential for expanded copper resources. the mountain states research development provided key data on the site revealing 14 million tons of historically mined material available for re processing split into 7.1 million tons of run of mine mineralized material on three historical heap leach pads. 7.7 million tons of blasted and leveled in situ leach mineralized material. for the material on the heap leach pads the original copper grade before leaching was estimated between 0.4 and 0.6 cut . this material yielded 30.5 million pounds of copper during operations from march 1966 to march 1975. an estimated 26.7 to 55.1 million pounds of copper may remain unrecovered. for the isl area the original copper grades were estimated between 0.269 and 0.292 cut. this area produced 2.70 million pounds of copper between mid 1972 and march 1975. it is estimated that 38.6 to 41.8 million pounds of copper may remain. the total potential unrecovered copper from both the heap leach pads and the isl area is estimated to be between 65 million to 96 million pounds . based on these findings world copper s technical advisory committee is considering re processing the material to recover the remaining copper. escalones copper project the escalones copper project managed by world copper ltd. is situated in chile approximately 35 kilometers east of el teniente one of the world s largest underground copper mines. the project is a high potential copper gold porphyry system encompassing a large area with significant mineralization. it has been a key focus for world copper ltd. due to its extensive resource potential and strategic location within a well known mining district. key details of the escalones project location 35 km east of el teniente chile. project type copper gold porphyry system. key resource estimates and potential measured indicated resources 426 million tonnes at 0.367 cut . this includes 3.45 billion pounds of copper. inferred resources 178 million tonnes at 0.356 cut. this includes an additional 1.4 billion pounds of copper. high grade core contains 104 million tonnes at 0.79 cut indicating a rich copper deposit within the larger resource area. the project s strategic development plan involves further exploration and resource expansion with a focus on defining high grade zones and enhancing the overall resource base. the escalones project represents a significant asset for world copper ltd. providing potential for long term copper production. conclusion copper s essential role in modern technologies particularly in the shift towards renewable energy and electric vehicles makes it a critical commodity. the rising demand coupled with potential supply constraints suggests a strong market outlook for copper. companies like world copper are well positioned to capitalize on this growing demand with significant projects like zonia and escalones poised for development and expansion.

electrical wiring electronics and renewable energy systems including solar panels and wind turbines. as the world transitions to greener energy sources the demand for copper is expected to soar. the push for electric vehicles is another major driver as each ev requires significantly more copper than a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle. additionally the expansion of 5g networks and increasing urbanization are set to further boost copper demand. copper has experienced a notable price increase over the past six months gaining approximately 6.54 since the beginning of 2024. this rise is attributed to growing demand from sectors like electric vehicles renewable energy infrastructure and general electronics all of which heavily rely on copper due to its superior electrical conductivity and thermal properties . looking ahead the outlook for copper remains optimistic. analysts predict that copper prices could continue to climb potentially reaching $11 000 per metric ton by the end of 2024. this anticipated growth is driven by an expected increase in global demand particularly from green energy initiatives and infrastructure projects. additionally potential supply constraints from major copper producing regions like chile and peru could further tighten the market supporting higher prices . introducing world copper world copper ltd. headquartered in vancouver bc is a canadian resource company specializing in the exploration and development of significant copper porphyry projects. the company s primary assets include the zonia project in arizona and the escalones project in chile. world copper also aims to capitalize on these assets by continuing to explore and expand the known mineralization leveraging its experienced team and strategic positioning in copper rich regions. the company is also exploring additional opportunities in the u.s. aligning with governmental initiatives recognizing copper as a critical metal further enhancing its portfolio s growth potential . zonia copper project the zonia copper project located in arizona is a significant venture managed by world copper ltd. this project includes a historically productive open pit copper mine with a substantial resource estimate that underscores its economic potential. the region s rich mineral deposits make the site an important focus for further exploration and development efforts. recent developments world copper recently announced a new discovery within the zonia copper project highlighting the potential for expanded copper resources. the mountain states research development provided key data on the site revealing 14 million tons of historically mined material available for re processing split into 7.1 million tons of run of mine mineralized material on three historical heap leach pads. 7.7 million tons of blasted and leveled in situ leach mineralized material. for the material on the heap leach pads the original copper grade before leaching was estimated between 0.4 and 0.6 cut . this material yielded 30.5 million pounds of copper during operations from march 1966 to march 1975. an estimated 26.7 to 55.1 million pounds of copper may remain unrecovered. for the isl area the original copper grades were estimated between 0.269 and 0.292 cut. this area produced 2.70 million pounds of copper between mid 1972 and march 1975. it is estimated that 38.6 to 41.8 million pounds of copper may remain. the total potential unrecovered copper from both the heap leach pads and the isl area is estimated to be between 65 million to 96 million pounds . based on these findings world copper s technical advisory committee is considering re processing the material to recover the remaining copper. escalones copper project the escalones copper project managed by world copper ltd. is situated in chile approximately 35 kilometers east of el teniente one of the world s largest underground copper mines. the project is a high potential copper gold porphyry system encompassing a large area with significant mineralization. it has been a key focus for world copper ltd. due to its extensive resource potential and strategic location within a well known mining district. key details of the escalones project location 35 km east of el teniente chile. project type copper gold porphyry system. key resource estimates and potential measured indicated resources 426 million tonnes at 0.367 cut . this includes 3.45 billion pounds of copper. inferred resources 178 million tonnes at 0.356 cut. this includes an additional 1.4 billion pounds of copper. high grade core contains 104 million tonnes at 0.79 cut indicating a rich copper deposit within the larger resource area. the project s strategic development plan involves further exploration and resource expansion with a focus on defining high grade zones and enhancing the overall resource base. the escalones project represents a significant asset for world copper ltd. providing potential for long term copper production. conclusion copper s essential role in modern technologies particularly in the shift towards renewable energy and electric vehicles makes it a critical commodity. the rising demand coupled with potential supply constraints suggests a strong market outlook for copper. companies like world copper are well positioned to capitalize on this growing demand with significant projects like zonia and escalones poised for development and expansion.

in the s p analyzing the analysts using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the s p [TITLE_END] hello everyone i m a lazy investor and don t like to do much due diligence but i do like to make money. unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as i ve lost money in the past for not doing my dd. as such i continue to be lazy but i try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. one such way that i have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. in essence i try to just have these analysts do the work for me. an idea i had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it s price action and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you ll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy i have a thesis that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. now i know that anyone who has read this far already thinks i m an idiot. many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor i m stupid for following their lead but i would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. as much as i have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates there is still much i don t know as i don t have a finance or economics degree. moreover as bad as you may think an analyst is they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. lastly and most importantly what i am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so i m not relying on a single analyst but several . i think if two dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. so what i did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 s p 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on yahoo finance. i then divided the current stock price by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. then i also listed how many total ratings each company had and how many of them were strong buys and buys . this yielded the following table a b c d e f g h 1 company current price price target percent to target total ratings strong buy ratings buy ratings of ratings that were strong buys 2 aapl 222.08 209.76 105.87 38 11 21 28.95 3 msft 418.35 459.66 91.01 34 14 13 41.18 4 nvda 117.02 125.69 93.10 38 14 15 36.84 5 amzn 186.98 206.43 90.58 47 15 28 31.91 6 meta

analysts using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the s p [TITLE_END] hello everyone i m a lazy investor and don t like to do much due diligence but i do like to make money. unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as i ve lost money in the past for not doing my dd. as such i continue to be lazy but i try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. one such way that i have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. in essence i try to just have these analysts do the work for me. the idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it s price action and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you ll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy i have a thesis that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. now i know that anyone who has read this far already thinks i m an idiot. many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore i m stupid for following their lead but i would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. as much as i have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates there is still much i don t know as i don t have a finance or economics degree. moreover as bad as you may think an analyst is they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. lastly and most importantly what i am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so i m not relying on a single analyst but several . i think if two dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. so what i did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 s p 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on yahoo finance. i then divided the current stock price by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. then i also listed how many total ratings each company had and how many of them were strong buys and buys . this yielded the following table a b c d e f g h 1 company current price price target percent to target total ratings strong buy ratings buy ratings of ratings that were strong buys 2

push for electric vehicles and renewable energy infrastructure significantly boosts copper demand. copper prices have risen approximately 6.54 since the beginning of 2024. analysts predict copper prices could reach $11 000 per metric ton by the end of 2024 driven by increased demand and potential supply constraints. the stock market is facing uncertainty with turbulent days ahead. tesla s recent missed earnings demonstrate how even major players can experience corrections and return to more expected levels. some experts suggest that the market may be undergoing a shift. while the exchanges might be fluctuating it could be wise to take a cautious approach and consider safer investments. however this doesn t mean you should only invest in assets with low potential growth. you might consider exploring small cap but promising companies as well as mining exploration firms with significant potential. these investments could offer opportunities for growth while still managing risk. what commodity should you look after while gold is here and represents one of the safest commodities in the world another one is emerging as a top asset. it is not silver but copper. why copper is essential for the modern world playing a crucial role in various industries due to its excellent electrical conductivity and thermal properties. copper is a critical component in the production of electrical wiring electronics and renewable energy systems including solar panels and wind turbines. as the world transitions to greener energy sources the demand for copper is expected to soar. the push for electric vehicles is another major driver as each ev requires significantly more copper than a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle. additionally the expansion of 5g networks and increasing urbanization are set to further boost copper demand. copper has experienced a notable price increase over the past six months gaining approximately 6.54 since the beginning of 2024. this rise is attributed to growing demand from sectors like electric vehicles renewable energy infrastructure and general electronics all of which heavily rely on copper due to its superior electrical conductivity and thermal properties . looking ahead the outlook for copper remains optimistic. analysts predict that copper prices could continue to climb potentially reaching $11 000 per metric ton by the end of 2024. this anticipated growth is driven by an expected increase in global demand particularly from green energy initiatives and infrastructure projects. additionally potential supply

in copper rich regions. the company is also exploring additional opportunities in the u.s. aligning with governmental initiatives recognizing copper as a critical metal further enhancing its portfolio s growth potential . zonia copper project the zonia copper project located in arizona is a significant venture managed by world copper ltd. this project includes a historically productive open pit copper mine with a substantial resource estimate that underscores its economic potential. the region s rich mineral deposits make the site an important focus for further exploration and development efforts. recent developments world copper recently announced a new discovery within the zonia copper project highlighting the potential for expanded copper resources. the mountain states research development provided key data on the site revealing 14 million tons of historically mined material available for re processing split into 7.1 million tons of run of mine mineralized material on three historical heap leach pads. 7.7 million tons of blasted and leveled in situ leach mineralized material. for the material on the heap leach pads the original copper grade before leaching was estimated between 0.4 and 0.6 cut. this material yielded 30.5 million pounds of copper during operations from march 1966 to march 1975. an estimated 26.7 to 55.1 million pounds of copper may remain unrecovered. for the isl area the original copper grades were estimated between 0.269 and 0.292 cut. this area produced 2.70 million pounds of copper between mid 1972 and march 1975. it is estimated that 38.6 to 41.8 million pounds of copper may remain. the total potential unrecovered copper from both the heap leach pads and the isl area is estimated to be between 65 million to 96 million pounds. based on these findings world copper s technical advisory committee is considering re processing the material to recover the remaining copper. escalones copper project the escalones copper project managed by

2024-08-04,2024-08-04 18:52:31,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,my thoughts on meta my thoughts on meta [TITLE_END] i d like to start a dialogue on what investors think about meta please challenge or add onto this discussion. this is a long post so i ve posted the tldr below. given the recent negative non farm jobs report and unemployment prints i think the market is missing a great opportunity in meta stock after a great earnings report. context meta pre earnings was about $470 and post earnings is now $488. they beat earnings by 8 . meta is down from its high of $540. position i have sold some meta puts at lower strike points so yes i am biased and want the company to perform well but will change my mind if there s a compelling argument otherwise. first thoughts on the market the sell off is a correction that gives long term investors an opportunity to buy companies at a less inflated p e ratio. i think recession concerns are overblown given the following absolute levels of unemployment remain very low meeting inflation targets are important for encouraging discretionary spending for lower income populations so that buying power won t be continuously eroded and we can move past this tightening cycle the fed has the ability to reduce interest rates significantly if warranted reduction in mortgage rates will allow existing homeowners to reduce interest burden and increase discretionary spending and stimulate big ticket purchases reduced bond yields means equities become more attractive in comparison. in the short run the carry trade has largely unwinded from its highs in july 2024 and further downside risk is less than before meta specific thoughts earnings just crushed earnings expectations their advertising business continues to run strong with user base growth. they stated that they have seen early benefits from their capex spend on ai . reasonable valuation in the short run currently trading at 25 pe and forward pe is 21 to 24 depending on eps forecasts. for context meta hit its lowest pe of 14 in december 2022 when people thought meta wouldn t exist anymore due to ad spend concerns apple privacy updates and issues with facebook engagement. compared to other tech companies investing in ai meta has one of the lowest p es with a comparable growth rate. relative to its peers its peg ratio is lower as well. however i think some of this difference is explained by its reliance on ad spend which is cyclical and less resilient in downturns. long term bets meta has invested in long term bets in ai and virtual reality which have yet to pay off and are considered a cost burden. for example in their recent earnings call they ve talked about using ai stand in personas to help influencers and small businesses answer questions to followers. if they become the small business or personal ai then they can deepen relationships with users and monetize in ways beyond ads through reoccuring services revenue. reoccuring revenue and proving monetization of ai will give it a boost in eps given investors value this type of revenue more. i believe meta is trying to move away from reliance on ads and provide value to users in ways that cannot be pulled away as easily spending risks capex is large which has a future drag on eps but i think they can scrap their vr initiatives if needed if cost efficiency is required. if ai doesn t work out eps growth will be harmed in the outer years . economic risks short term dependence on ad spend which is cylical and impacted during recessions chinese companies spending a lot on meta for ads this might go away i think given interest rates are coming down hopefully any softness will be alleviated quickly. tldr short term business is reasonably valued and forward valuations aren t priced for explosive ai monetization. this results in upside both from an eps and p e perspective if there is no prolonged economic downturn and especially if new ai products show early chutes of monetization. would appreciate any thoughts challenges to this from other investors.

2024-08-12,2024-08-12 23:56:32,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,tesla stops taking orders for its least expensive cybertruck cheapest cybertruck now costs $99 990 tesla stops taking orders for its least expensive cybertruck cheapest cybertruck now costs $99 990 [TITLE_END] tesla has quietly stopped taking orders on its entry level cybertruck which was originally priced at $61 000 leaving the $100 000 version as the new starting point for potential buyers. this move is a significant shift from the initial promises made by ceo elon musk who in 2019 projected that the cybertruck would cost around $40 000 and deliver over 500 miles on a single charge. now the least expensive model available is the dual motor foundation series which is priced at $99 990 and offers a 318 mile range. this model is available for delivery as soon as this month while the higher end $119 990 tri motor cyberbeast which has a 301 mile range is expected to be delivered starting in october. despite musk s earlier claims of having over 1 million reservations some analysts believe that interest in the truck may not be as strong as initially expected especially for the higher priced models. sam abuelsamid an analyst at guidehouse insights noted that this latest move shows that demand is a lot less than a million trucks particularly for those who were holding out for a more affordable option. tesla s shift to prioritize its more expensive models is a clear signal that the company is focusing on maximizing profitability even if it means pricing out a significant portion of its potential customer base. the cybertruck with its unconventional trapezoidal design inspired by the blade runner movie and its stainless steel body has certainly captured the imagination of many but the reality of its pricing and range limitations may dampen enthusiasm for some. sales figures show that tesla sold nearly 4 800 cybertrucks in july marking its best month yet and making it the best selling vehicle in the u.s. priced over $100 000. however maintaining this level of sales at such high price points could prove to be a challenge. a spokesperson for cox automotive commented that while tesla has sold more than 16 000 units so far sustained high volume at that price point will be a challenge reflecting the potential difficulty tesla may face in maintaining strong sales numbers without a more affordable option in the lineup. the cybertruck s journey to market has been fraught with delays and challenges with deliveries only beginning in november 2023 after years of setbacks and a difficult production ramp up. with the latest pricing strategy tesla seems to be betting on the allure of its high end models to carry the day but whether this gamble will pay off remains to be seen. source

going to be a long post so bear with me. i think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. now you re probably thinking ok but how gdp continues to grow unemployment continues to be stable and the market is higher than ever right now. i am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory. 1. microsoft now you re probably wondering why this is the first company i am bringing up when microsoft grew revenue and income. microsoft grew revenue by 10 and net income by 20 . microsoft does both software and hardware. the software parts of the business like office cloud and services increased substantially. however when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. device revenue decreased 20 . these are things like personal computers accessories and other electronics that microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. gaming revenue decreased by 5 with xbox hardware sales falling 11 . we are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. people are pulling back on items like pcs and gaming consoles. now you re probably thinking yeah random redditor not everybody buys pcs xboxs every year. this means nothing. so now we go to our next company. 2. apple like microsoft apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. if you don t personally use them you know someone who uses their products. if we look at apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. hardware sales were down across the board. macs iphones ipads and wearables all declined. however no what didn t decline services. like microsoft services grew for apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. now you re probably thinking yeah random redditor but apple isn t cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. so that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things. ok let s keep going. 3. nike nike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. like apple if you don t use their products you personally know someone who uses them. they re everywhere. nike reported a decline in revenue by 2 in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10 drop in q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. we saw nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and it s expected to get worse in 2025. the stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides covid these levels haven t been seen since 2018. now you re probably thinking ok random redditor but nike isn t cool anymore and adidas is better and sells more track suits to the eastern europeans. so it makes sense why it s down. ok lets look at more. 4. home depot and lowe s the two home building retailer giants of the us. if you own a home or have done work on your home you re familiar with these 2 companies. these 2 companies are staples to the entire us economy. similar to ups and fedex if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing you re paying attention to these two companies as they re crucial to its health. in 2023 we saw home depots sales decrease by 3 and earnings decrease by 9.5 . we just saw home depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. we saw a similar result for lowe s. they reported a net sales decrease of 11 and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. with expectations being another 2 3 fall in comparable sales. both home depot and lowe s stock are still down from their highs in 2021. home depot is down 16 and lowe s down 10 which was close to 3 years ago. now you re probably thinking ok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about. ok how about another one. 5. target target is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. target is the upperclass walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies i mention they appeal to the middle high class. in 2023 target reported a sales decline of 1.7 and a comparable sales decline of 3.7 . full year revenue decreased by 1.7 . the company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. target stock is currently down 48 from its high with its high being in 2021. i can really keep going with this. here is some more. 1. estee lauder massive stock decline 2. ulta beauty massive stock decline 3. ups massive stock decline 4. lululemon massive stock decline 5. dollar general massive stock decline 6. hershey massive stock decline 7. starbucks massive stock decline now what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about these are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. now we are seeing the middle class consumer pull back on these products. maybe you re not buying the next microsoft pc this year or the new iphone or the new pair of nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas. this is causing the market to price in future bad results and causing the stock price to crash. we are seeing a case where the market is not reflecting the economy. businesses all across various industries are showing declines across the board and it s only expected to get worse. now with all these declines in other industries why is the market so high the answer is tech. companies like nvidia google amazon microsoft apple meta broadcom qualcomm amd etc. are dominating the market. with these stocks continuing to increase and other stocks continuing to decrease it s only getting worse. they have a heavy weight on the indexes and they re causing most of the gains in the index while we are seeing other sectors decline. this has caused tech valuations to soar and other areas of the market to lag. now what does this mean going forward. are we due for a massive decline in the market where we see tech finally come down i personally don t think so. however i think going forward we won t see the returns that tech has given now going forward. i think these stock declines in the market has presented opportunities and we can possibly see a sector rotation. for example the fed cutting rates and alleviating pressure on the consumer. a case where tech lags behind and we see other areas of the market which have fallen start to climb. i could be wrong on this but these are just my thoughts. let me know what you think about this theory.

2024-09-06,2024-09-06 10:33:43,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",trading,research and detailed analysis on high tide inc $hiti research and detailed analysis on high tide inc $hiti [TITLE_END] background how became the leading cannabis retailer in canada the beginning raj grover the founder and ceo who owns 9 of the company and has never sold a single share comes from an entrepreneurial family and had already experienced success with several smaller businesses before establishing during a business trip to india in search of opportunities in fashion accessories or body jewelry raj stumbled upon the potential of cannabis consumption accessories. recognizing the margin arbitrage opportunity he shipped $10 000 worth of consumption accessories from new delhi to canada and sold everything overnight. after replicating this success a few more times raj decided to open a store. this marked the beginning of high tide s story . in 2009 raj opened smokers corner with an initial investment of less than $50 000 and grew it into a multimillion dollar empire. at that time there were only two or three competitors with unappealing stores. raj believed that by creating a differentiated store in a smart location he could easily capture market share and he was right. by leveraging his established roots in indonesia thailand china and india he was able to not only provide a better customer experience but also offer much cheaper products. cannabis legalization in canada always looking to stay ahead raj seized the opportunity when the prime minister of canada announced that recreational cannabis would soon be legalized. with an existing customer base of cannabis users it made perfect sense for raj to expand into selling cannabis itself. he realized that if he only sold accessories he would eventually lose customers to shops that offered both cannabis and accessories. after nine years of focusing on consumption accessories and accumulating nearly $10m in retained earnings raj raised $88.5m for the first time in 2018 and ventured into the equity markets marking the beginning of high tide s journey as a publicly traded company . with easier access to capital when compared to its peers high tide expanded its footprint across canada highlighted by the significant acquisition of its competitor meta in 2020 which increased the number of stores from 37 to 67. the strategy shift that made everything change around the same time with higher margin profiles a pivotal decision for the company . from acquiring several brands in the u.s. such as smoke cartel fabcbd daily high club dankstop and nuleaf holdings to later acquiring blessedcbd in the uk high tide leveraged its market power to enhance margins and diversify its revenue streams. in the summer of 2021 was accepted for listing on the nasdaq marking a significant milestone. later that year a transformative decision was made high tide launched a discount club model for its retail stores in october 2021 . with consolidated margins higher than any competitor due to the previously mentioned cbd related acquisitions high tide could offer cannabis at remarkably low prices attracting loyal members and rapidly gaining market share . although this discount model initially involved selling cannabis at a loss the move proved to be incredibly successful . high tide s market share increased from less than 4 to over 10 in less than three years despite representing less than 5 of the total cannabis retail store count. today the discount model program has more than 1.5m members and continues to grow each quarter . being the first of its kind discount model was the key differentiating factor that propelled high tide to become the leading cannabis retailer in canada. no competitor could match their prices and raj targeted cannabis users who consumed regularly and were highly price sensitive. when i first started investing in high tide one of its closest competitors was fire flower holdings which ultimately went bankrupt following this price war. there are many more examples of competitors that went bankrupt following this showing how strong has become in the sector. and the consolidation of the market in canada is just starting. this strategy also significantly diminished the illicit market further strengthening high tide s market share. after capturing market share it was time to turn profitable while raj sacrificed margins to achieve this economies of scale and several initiatives aimed at improving margins allowed as well as positive net income in the most recent quarterly results with a consolidated leadership position stronger than ever. overall high tide took a calculated risk to become the leader in the country and it proved to be incredibly successful. this success was only possible due to the ceo s extensive experience in the sector and deep understanding of the cannabis consumer surpassing that of any other management team. what s next for the best is yet to come. while the focus on becoming fcf led to a notable deceleration in revenue growth is now returning to its high growth strategy . despite cannabis being legal for over five years there s still significant market potential to capture in canada. a recent regulatory change in ontario now allows one company to operate up to 150 recreational cannabis stores doubling the previous cap of 75. this change is benefiting large retail chains like capitalizing on the opportunity and targeting the high presence of the illicit market in the region. moreover the canadian market is experiencing significant consolidation allowing high tide to expand its market share organically and through acquisitions at depressed multiples. for example high tide recently acquired a store for 1.5x last quarter s annualized adj. ebitda. the ceo mentioned in the last earnings call that he s in negotiations with a sizable player to acquire additional stores aiming to accelerate its footprint expansion and surpass this year s initial target. every month there are dozens of cannabis stores closing in canada because they simply can t compete with over the next two years high tide is expected to reach a 15 market share up from 10.9 today. it s worth mentioning that raj and his team have always been methodical in selecting store locations ensuring each one yields significant returns which is why the annual revenue per store at surpasses the industry average by a wide margin. over the next three to five years there s potential to reach an annual revenue of $1b in canada alone . is one of the very few cannabis companies that does not depend on any new legislation to keep growing and improving its bottom line numbers. ongoing developments in the u.s. might give the green light to expand there. significant changes are on the horizon for the u.s. cannabis sector. the potential rescheduling of cannabis from schedule i to schedule iii could open doors for u.s. cannabis companies to list on major exchanges like nasdaq or nyse making it easier for institutional investors to get involved. the only reason high tide hasn t entered the u.s. market yet is to avoid compromising its nasdaq listing so this would finally open doors for the canadian leader. note for those who don t know u.s. cannabis companies can t be listed on the nyse or nasdaq only on the otc markets. since there s no issue. this is also one of the reasons why institutional ownership in the sector is so low. high tide with its vast e commerce base of over 3m u.s. customers and profitable operations is poised to leverage these developments. raj grover s strategic approach as a second mover allows him to avoid pitfalls and strategically open stores in key states. the company is ready to capitalize on its strong foundation and scale efficiently aiming to secure significant market share with well chosen locations and a clear expansion strategy. most u.s. operators struggle to turn a profit even with gross margins in the 40 50 range while is both fcf and net income profitable with a gross margin below 30 . while the company doesn t depend on the u.s. market to continue growing this presents an additional catalyst for its upcoming growth trajectory. regardless of whether this expansion happens quickly or not these developments will attract a wave of new investors to the sector and contribute to an overall expansion in multiples. high tide is becoming the costco of cannabis after the success of its free discount model which gathered over 1.5m members in under three years launched elite a paid membership with even better offers . the rollout began slowly but membership is now growing at a record pace 226 yoy and 38 qoq last quarter. it s worth noting that this growth is happening while the subscription price is being raised. although the absolute number is still relatively small at 46 000 the conversion rate of regular club members to elite ones is getting better every quarter. you only need to make a small purchase for the membership price to pay for itself it s exactly like the long term vision is for high tide to be the of cannabis driving strong and predictable cash flows and strengthening high tide s competitive edge . i believe this is one of the catalysts that will help further improve bottom line margins. despite being a retailer with relatively low margins have room to grow . cannabis prices in canada are just starting to stabilize and is waiting for full market stabilization before aggressively launching white labels. while many independents are closing and the market is consolidating isn t raising prices yet to avoid aiding competitors. the long term strategy is to leverage pricing power gradually . when i asked the ceo if fcf margins are nearing a peak the response was clear no there are still many growth opportunities . as the market consolidates and market share increases they anticipate further improvements in both gross and fcf margins plus new areas to explore with scale and other initiatives. valuation is the most superior cannabis business yet the cheapest. retail investors in canada alone have lost over $130b since the 2017 bubble popped so i understand why everyone is wary of this sector. but i have demonstrated how is different from the most well known cannabis companies like and others. high tide generates strong fcf and has a track record of consistently impressive execution . most importantly it has a highly aligned management team that cares about shareholders which is rare in the sector. the fact that this sector is at its peak of pessimism is what makes it possible for us to buy at such a cheap valuation. it s also worth mentioning that unlike the other names mentioned high tide went public late in the game and was not part of the bubble in 2017 2018. that s why it is so underfollowed and why most people don t even know about it.let s check the numbers. generated cad $22.7m in fcf over the last 12 months so it is currently trading at 10x ltm fcf. it s worth noting that this was the first full year of fcf profitability so this number should improve further from here. but since most cannabis companies are not fcf positive let s use ev ebitda as a proxy. is trading at 5x its ntm adj. ebitda while the average for is 7 8x. importantly its adj. ebitda from these last 12 months increased 82.7 from the previous year. it s mind blowing that it can trade at such a low multiple. the disparity is even larger when we look at other nasdaq listed cannabis stocks. for instance is trading at almost 20x at the same and isn t even ebitda positive. is the best performing cannabis company and one of the very few that is already generating both fcf and net income yet it remains the cheapest . faster growth better margins a superior management team a winning business model the lowest valuation a complete bargain at least in my view. while most investors are avoiding this sector due to the well known companies that destroy shareholder value i m taking advantage of this opportunity by investing in what i consider a hidden gem. the recent acquisition of nova cannabis by at a low valuation multiple might have highlighted how undervalued is. nova cannabis was one of the few competitors to high tide but under ownership it has lost direction. this acquisition occurred at an ev ttm revenue multiple of 0.55 0.6 while a more established and superior business was trading at 0.4x. similarly ev ttm gross profit multiple of 1.4x contrasts sharply with nova s 2.4x. this disparity indicates that is undervalued and the market is beginning to recognize this. 2nd following the news that the dea has scheduled a hearing on the marijuana rescheduling proposal after the u.s. election causing the entire cannabis sector to drop significantly performance remained strong. despite the sector wide double digit decline has maintained a notably higher value compared to its pre news levels. this resilience suggests that is too cheap to ignore and the market is catching on. before finishing i d like to highlight this has less than 10 institutional ownership while over 75 of the market is owned by institutions. peter lynch often talks about this . if you want to achieve multibagger returns find a hidden gem before the institutions do. $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti $hiti

2024-09-06,2024-09-06 17:18:42,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,sen. elizabeth warren writes a letter backing the doj investigation into nvidia antitrust allegations sen. elizabeth warren writes a letter backing the doj investigation into nvidia antitrust allegations [TITLE_END] september 5 2024 dear assistant attorney general kanter. competition is key to a thriving u.s. economy and faster economic growth. this is particularly true in the semiconductor market which will drive future advances in artificial intelligence and other tech breakthroughs the reason congress provided $52.7 billion in support for the industry in the chips and science act. this is why i welcome the reports that the department of justice has opened an antitrust investigation into nvidia whose blockbuster growth has made it one of the world s largest companies. while this growth has been primarily driven by the recent ai boom it has been supercharged by nvidia s use of anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation. i am pleased that the doj has joined authorities in other countries such as the united kingdom and the european union in investigating nvidia s conduct. until recently nvidia was a relatively niche provider of gaming chips but as a prime beneficiary of the al frenzy it has seen its market capitalization increase by 250 between november 2021 and may 2024. the money involved is vast and big tech is spending most of it microsoft and meta spent a combined $9 billion on nvidia s chips last year alone. amazon purchased as many as 50 000 chips in 2023. and google plans to pour nearly $40 billion into ai this year much of it on nvidia s products and services. as a result of this spending nvidia now controls an estimated 90 of the market for high end ai chips and 98 of the lucrative and growing data center graphics processing units market. its hardware has been the underpinning of almost every ai milestone including the development and deployment of openal s chatgpt 4 and other models. market power like that means the company decides who gets chips from its limited supply and how much they pay with some experts theorizing that nvidia has been making a 1000 profit through the retail price of some of its chips. this has effectively made nvidia the gatekeeper for the world s ai future. but in carrying out this responsibility nvidia has shown that it is not committed to fair play. the company locks customers in by bundling products software and services a practice that has already triggered antitrust scrutiny in france resulting in nvidia s own programming software being the only system that is fully compatible with its chips. in a move that was ultimately blocked by the federal trade commission nvidia has attempted to further raise barriers to entry by acquiring arm limited the developer of essential chip architecture. if the deal had gone through experts say nvidia would have gained control over a software architecture that most of the industry relies on. as nvidia cements its dominance venture funders are investing less in companies attempting to build competing chips. indeed the number of u.s. venture funding deals for al chips fell approximately 80 between 2022 and 2023. the insatiable hunger of gargantuan big tech companies for nvidia chips along with the company s opaque and preferential allocation of them are starving startup companies of the infrastructure they need to do business and crowding academic ai researchers out of the field. allowing a single company so much influence over ai research development and monetization poses dire economic risks. competition powers a virtuous cycle of rapid innovation by impelling each market participant to create the best products. it creates jobs and generates tax revenue. it reduces the need for regulation by giving the market a role in keeping aspiring monopolists in check. it reduces costs for companies by giving them a choice of suppliers. without the intervention of u.s. regulators the prospects of restoring competition in the semiconductor market are bleak. they will only grow bleaker as nvidia approaches 100 ownership of the market and as it begins pouring money into lobbying alongside the conventional big tech players to shape the contours of ai regulation and lock in its advantage. i thank you for your leadership and support efforts to undertake a comprehensive and fair investigation into nvidia. sincerely elizabeth warren united states senator

2024-09-14,2024-09-14 11:36:31,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",pennystocks,research and detailed analysis on high tide inc $hiti research and detailed analysis on high tide inc $hiti [TITLE_END] background how became the leading cannabis retailer in canada the beginning raj grover the founder and ceo who owns 9 of the company and has never sold a single share comes from an entrepreneurial family and had already experienced success with several smaller businesses before establishing during a business trip to india in search of opportunities in fashion accessories or body jewelry raj stumbled upon the potential of cannabis consumption accessories. recognizing the margin arbitrage opportunity he shipped $10 000 worth of consumption accessories from new delhi to canada and sold everything overnight. after replicating this success a few more times raj decided to open a store. this marked the beginning of high tide s story . in 2009 raj opened smokers corner with an initial investment of less than $50 000 and grew it into a multimillion dollar empire. at that time there were only two or three competitors with unappealing stores. raj believed that by creating a differentiated store in a smart location he could easily capture market share and he was right. by leveraging his established roots in indonesia thailand china and india he was able to not only provide a better customer experience but also offer much cheaper products. cannabis legalization in canada always looking to stay ahead raj seized the opportunity when the prime minister of canada announced that recreational cannabis would soon be legalized. with an existing customer base of cannabis users it made perfect sense for raj to expand into selling cannabis itself. he realized that if he only sold accessories he would eventually lose customers to shops that offered both cannabis and accessories. after nine years of focusing on consumption accessories and accumulating nearly $10m in retained earnings raj raised $88.5m for the first time in 2018 and ventured into the equity markets marking the beginning of high tide s journey as a publicly traded company . with easier access to capital when compared to its peers high tide expanded its footprint across canada highlighted by the significant acquisition of its competitor meta in 2020 which increased the number of stores from 37 to 67. the strategy shift that made everything change around the same time with higher margin profiles a pivotal decision for the company . from acquiring several brands in the u.s. such as smoke cartel fabcbd daily high club dankstop and nuleaf holdings to later acquiring blessedcbd in the uk high tide leveraged its market power to enhance margins and diversify its revenue streams. in the summer of 2021 was accepted for listing on the nasdaq marking a significant milestone. later that year a transformative decision was made high tide launched a discount club model for its retail stores in october 2021 . with consolidated margins higher than any competitor due to the previously mentioned cbd related acquisitions high tide could offer cannabis at remarkably low prices attracting loyal members and rapidly gaining market share . although this discount model initially involved selling cannabis at a loss the move proved to be incredibly successful . high tide s market share increased from less than 4 to over 10 in less than three years despite representing less than 5 of the total cannabis retail store count. today the discount model program has more than 1.5m members and continues to grow each quarter . being the first of its kind discount model was the key differentiating factor that propelled high tide to become the leading cannabis retailer in canada. no competitor could match their prices and raj targeted cannabis users who consumed regularly and were highly price sensitive. when i first started investing in high tide one of its closest competitors was fire flower holdings which ultimately went bankrupt following this price war. there are many more examples of competitors that went bankrupt following this showing how strong has become in the sector. and the consolidation of the market in canada is just starting. this strategy also significantly diminished the illicit market further strengthening high tide s market share. after capturing market share it was time to turn profitable while raj sacrificed margins to achieve this economies of scale and several initiatives aimed at improving margins allowed as well as positive net income in the most recent quarterly results with a consolidated leadership position stronger than ever. overall high tide took a calculated risk to become the leader in the country and it proved to be incredibly successful. this success was only possible due to the ceo s extensive experience in the sector and deep understanding of the cannabis consumer surpassing that of any other management team. what s next for the best is yet to come. while the focus on becoming fcf led to a notable deceleration in revenue growth is now returning to its high growth strategy . despite cannabis being legal for over five years there s still significant market potential to capture in canada. a recent regulatory change in ontario now allows one company to operate up to 150 recreational cannabis stores doubling the previous cap of 75. this change is benefiting large retail chains like capitalizing on the opportunity and targeting the high presence of the illicit market in the region. moreover the canadian market is experiencing significant consolidation allowing high tide to expand its market share organically and through acquisitions at depressed multiples. for example high tide recently acquired a store for 1.5x last quarter s annualized adj. ebitda. the ceo mentioned in the last earnings call that he s in negotiations with a sizable player to acquire additional stores aiming to accelerate its footprint expansion and surpass this year s initial target. every month there are dozens of cannabis stores closing in canada because they simply can t compete with over the next two years high tide is expected to reach a 15 market share up from 10.9 today. it s worth mentioning that raj and his team have always been methodical in selecting store locations ensuring each one yields significant returns which is why the annual revenue per store at surpasses the industry average by a wide margin. over the next three to five years there s potential to reach an annual revenue of $1b in canada alone . is one of the very few cannabis companies that does not depend on any new legislation to keep growing and improving its bottom line numbers. ongoing developments in the u.s. might give the green light to expand there. significant changes are on the horizon for the u.s. cannabis sector. the potential rescheduling of cannabis from schedule i to schedule iii could open doors for u.s. cannabis companies to list on major exchanges like nasdaq or nyse making it easier for institutional investors to get involved. the only reason high tide hasn t entered the u.s. market yet is to avoid compromising its nasdaq listing so this would finally open doors for the canadian leader. note for those who don t know u.s. cannabis companies can t be listed on the nyse or nasdaq only on the otc markets. since there s no issue. this is also one of the reasons why institutional ownership in the sector is so low. high tide with its vast e commerce base of over 3m u.s. customers and profitable operations is poised to leverage these developments. raj grover s strategic approach as a second mover allows him to avoid pitfalls and strategically open stores in key states. the company is ready to capitalize on its strong foundation and scale efficiently aiming to secure significant market share with well chosen locations and a clear expansion strategy. most u.s. operators struggle to turn a profit even with gross margins in the 40 50 range while is both fcf and net income profitable with a gross margin below 30 . while the company doesn t depend on the u.s. market to continue growing this presents an additional catalyst for its upcoming growth trajectory. regardless of whether this expansion happens quickly or not these developments will attract a wave of new investors to the sector and contribute to an overall expansion in multiples. high tide is becoming the costco of cannabis after the success of its free discount model which gathered over 1.5m members in under three years launched elite a paid membership with even better offers . the rollout began slowly but membership is now growing at a record pace 226 yoy and 38 qoq last quarter. it s worth noting that this growth is happening while the subscription price is being raised. although the absolute number is still relatively small at 46 000 the conversion rate of regular club members to elite ones is getting better every quarter. you only need to make a small purchase for the membership price to pay for itself it s exactly like the long term vision is for high tide to be the of cannabis driving strong and predictable cash flows and strengthening high tide s competitive edge . i believe this is one of the catalysts that will help further improve bottom line margins. despite being a retailer with relatively low margins have room to grow . cannabis prices in canada are just starting to stabilize and is waiting for full market stabilization before aggressively launching white labels. while many independents are closing and the market is consolidating isn t raising prices yet to avoid aiding competitors. the long term strategy is to leverage pricing power gradually . when i asked the ceo if fcf margins are nearing a peak the response was clear no there are still many growth opportunities . as the market consolidates and market share increases they anticipate further improvements in both gross and fcf margins plus new areas to explore with scale and other initiatives. valuation is the most superior cannabis business yet the cheapest. retail investors in canada alone have lost over $130b since the 2017 bubble popped so i understand why everyone is wary of this sector. but i have demonstrated how is different from the most well known cannabis companies like and others. high tide generates strong fcf and has a track record of consistently impressive execution . most importantly it has a highly aligned management team that cares about shareholders which is rare in the sector. the fact that this sector is at its peak of pessimism is what makes it possible for us to buy at such a cheap valuation. it s also worth mentioning that unlike the other names mentioned high tide went public late in the game and was not part of the bubble in 2017 2018. that s why it is so underfollowed and why most people don t even know about it.let s check the numbers. generated cad $22.7m in fcf over the last 12 months so it is currently trading at 10x ltm fcf. it s worth noting that this was the first full year of fcf profitability so this number should improve further from here. but since most cannabis companies are not fcf positive let s use ev ebitda as a proxy. is trading at 5x its ntm adj. ebitda while the average for is 7 8x. importantly its adj. ebitda from these last 12 months increased 82.7 from the previous year. it s mind blowing that it can trade at such a low multiple. the disparity is even larger when we look at other nasdaq listed cannabis stocks. for instance is trading at almost 20x at the same and isn t even ebitda positive. is the best performing cannabis company and one of the very few that is already generating both fcf and net income yet it remains the cheapest . faster growth better margins a superior management team a winning business model the lowest valuation a complete bargain at least in my view. while most investors are avoiding this sector due to the well known companies that destroy shareholder value i m taking advantage of this opportunity by investing in what i consider a hidden gem. the recent acquisition of nova cannabis by at a low valuation multiple might have highlighted how undervalued is. nova cannabis was one of the few competitors to high tide but under ownership it has lost direction. this acquisition occurred at an ev ttm revenue multiple of 0.55 0.6 while a more established and superior business was trading at 0.4x. similarly ev ttm gross profit multiple of 1.4x contrasts sharply with nova s 2.4x. this disparity indicates that is undervalued and the market is beginning to recognize this. 2nd following the news that the dea has scheduled a hearing on the marijuana rescheduling proposal after the u.s. election causing the entire cannabis sector to drop significantly performance remained strong. despite the sector wide double digit decline has maintained a notably higher value compared to its pre news levels. this resilience suggests that is too cheap to ignore and the market is catching on. before finishing i d like to highlight this has less than 10 institutional ownership while over 75 of the market is owned by institutions. peter lynch often talks about this . if you want to achieve multibagger returns find a hidden gem before the institutions do. for greater understanding look at the company presentation since images are not

2024-09-22,2024-09-22 18:52:00,TSLA,Tesla,trading,webull is there a better way webull is there a better way [TITLE_END] morning all i ve been interested in investing many years now. eventually i put some money together right before the pandemic and opened a robinhood account. i had nothing to compare it to and at that time i was just investing so i didn t see any problems with it. simply put i had no expectations. fast forward 2 3 years a good friend gets heavy into tsla and options. when i was trading on robinhood back in the day i became aware of options but had trouble understanding them. anyway the past year talking to my friend he explained them to me and i got the hang of it and the importance of charting candles levels the whole 9 yards. then as he was still learning himself he kind of ran out of things to teach me so i ended up immersing myself in learning about charting and the technical analysis. my major was economics and i work in business so i had a pretty strong understanding of economics and the market generally. i eventually read a bunch martin j pring s 800 page understanding technical analysis was especially helpful as was investopedia. anyway my friend invited me to webull told me its the shit so i said why not. after a month of getting the hang of it using the papertrade feature and just generally getting comfortable and configuring it how i wanted i dropped some money it. things are going well but i have two issues. 1. i d like to have one roth type brokerage account elsewhere and then daytrade swingtrade out of the other one. 2. i d prefer to not use a chinese app. after doing a lot of research based on reviews i narrowed it down to the following fidelity ibkr etrade thinkorswim moomoo what i m looking for is something comparable to webull s really fantastic ui charting tools and its superb integrated access to company financials. it also has customizable screens watchlists and has yet to bug out on me. i also make 5 on my cash balance. my options fees under 500 contracts are also free whereas on the us brokerages the norm seems to be 0.65 per contract. i downloaded tos and it s pretty awkward compared to webull especially the charting and although it does kind of work its tedious af however i can chart on webull or other software if need be. downloaded e trade and again while not as strong as webull its more intuitive than tos at least. i checked out the reviews for fidelity on the app store and they were almost universally extremely negative. ibkr while getting slightly better reviews still got quite awful reviews from users in the app store especially in regards to filling option orders and something about only being able to do simple calls and puts not condors straddles etc. i have yet to try moomoo . i may have to default to robinhood for my investment account and can use other apps for advanced research and charting. what are you guys thoughts what are you using

2024-09-25,2024-09-25 21:42:22,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,meta unveils $299 quest 3s vr headset orion ar glasses prototype meta unveils $299 quest 3s vr headset orion ar glasses prototype [TITLE_END] meta announced the quest 3s the latest virtual reality headset to come out of the company s reality labs division and a cheaper offering than its predecessor. the device will go on sale on oct. 15 and it ll retail starting at $299 down from the $499 starting price for 2023 s quest 3. the device can be used to watch movies as well as run vr fitness apps and gaming meta said wednesday at its connect event in menlo park california. the company positioned the headset as a multitasking computer putting it in competition with apple s $3 499 vision pro headset that launched in february. in addition to the quest 3s meta on wednesday also showcased its latest prototype of augmented reality smart glasses and announced a flurry of new features for its meta ai chatbot. meta s previous quest devices are the bestselling vr headsets with millions shipped thanks to heavy marketing and a lower price than many competitors but those efforts have yet to spark a cultural phenomenon or a mainstream software ecosystem around vr. including its acquisition of oculus in 2014 meta has poured more than $65 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts. meta ceo mark zuckerberg has defended the company s spending as a strategic initiative to prevent apple from controlling future hardware platforms. although there was hope among vr developers that apple s entry into the market would spur a wave of new apps and users apple hasn t revealed sales for its headset and reports suggest that sales have been in small volumes under 1 million units partially due to its high price. what it does a meta representative said the s in quest 3s stands for start as in getting started with vr. many of the new meta features that the company discussed for the $299 quest 3s have counterparts on apple s vision pro including a mode that allows for the device to be used on an airplane and another that simulates a large movie theater inside the headset. meta highlighted improved passthrough the term used to described when a vr headset uses cameras and sensors on the outside of the device to display live real time video inside the headset. that function is intended to make users feel like they are looking through a display and allows them to interact with the real world while keeping the headset on. for the quest 3s meta added a dedicated button to turn on passthrough. the company has emphasized the ability of the quest 3s to multitask and run apps positioning it as a computing device instead of a game console. all the things you can do with a general purpose computer quest is the full package zuckerberg said. in demos provided tuesday meta showcased the device running as many as four apps at one time on floating screens inside the headset including a youtube video a browser amazon music and meta s app store. meta says the headset can handle six windows. but the demo experience was not smooth. the amazon music app crashed window controls would disappear and meta s controllers would fall asleep after a few minutes if the user wasn t pressing buttons. besides the quest 3s meta also announced a price cut for last s year quest 3 bringing the price of the 512gb version down from $649 to $499. the quest 3 has more advanced lenses and a superior screen with a higher resolution than the quest 3s. additionally meta said it will discontinue the quest pro its $999 headset launched in 2022 that never gained much momentum and the older quest 2 headset. eventually glasses zuckerberg s justification for spending so much on vr and ar is his belief that the technology will eventually end up in lightweight transparent glasses that overlay computer graphics and information onto the real world. investing in vr software and hardware are early steps toward those glasses which could take as much as a decade to develop zuckerberg previously said. zuckerberg showed off an early concept of what those glasses could look like on wednesday. the thick black framed prototype called orion won t be sold to consumers but meta says they will be used internally as the company continues working toward the consumer glasses it hopes to one day sell. this is where we are going zuckerberg said. meta hopes the next version of orion will be available to consumers as the company s first full ar glasses zuckerberg said without giving a timetable for when that may be. orion is meta s first fully functioning prototype ar glasses zuckerberg said and the device is tethered wirelessly to a small puck. the prototype uses a wristband component to pick up on users neural signals and let them control the orion glasses using their brains. that technology stems from the company s 2019 acquisition of ctrl labs. orion enables users to play games multi task with multiple windows and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar zuckerberg said. meta s orion prototype comes a week after snap announced its fifth generation spectacles ar glasses. those thick framed glasses will only be made available to developers who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build ar apps for the device. this isn t the first time meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where vr and ar technology is headed. the orion glasses are an improvement on project nazare prototype smart glasses that zuckerberg announced in 2021 when the company changed its name from facebook. meta does sell a pair of glasses with a built in camera in partnership with essilorluxottica called ray ban meta which start at $299 and were announced in 2023. while these glasses don t have any displays they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with meta ai the company s voice assistant. as part of wednesday s event meta announced new meta ai features for its ray ban smart glasses. for example the ray ban meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in spanish and if asked can translate in the user s ear a new improvement meta said. the camera can scan qr codes and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes. another new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked. li chen miller the vice president of product in charge of ray ban meta glasses told cnbc that when she travels she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door and later she asks meta ai to recall the number. those features will become available later this year the company said. the ray ban meta smart glasses have sold more than 730 000 units in their first three quarters according to market researcher idc. in july zuckerberg told investors that they were a bigger hit sooner than expected. last week essilorluxottica and meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses. ai that speaks zuckerberg also introduced improvements to its meta ai chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice in addition to written prompts. with voice users will be able to have oral conversations with meta ai which is accessed through meta s apps. users will be able to perform actions using their voice such as telling meta ai to take a photo by talking to their smartphone. for meta ai s new feature the company is using computer generated voices from celebrities including awkwafina judi dench john cena keegan michael key and kristen bell. the new siri like meta ai voice feature will be available over the next month for u.s. canadian australian and new zealand users of whatsapp instagram facebook and messenger. the meta ai announcement comes a day after rival openai the maker of chatgpt announced an advanced voice feature for people who pay for its premium service. meta s new chatbot features are based on the company s ai model llama. meta on wednesday announced a newer version of llama called llama 3.2. this updated model can understand both images and text an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people s written prompts. source

stocksy s weekly dd [TITLE_END] hey everyone here are some notes from companies that i have been looking at this week. good lord kraken has been climbinggg. zomd and bolt both new mentions for me but they both look super solid. hope this can be of value to anyone. please feel free to comment any tickers you would like me to checkout cheers zomd technologies $zomd.v market cap 40m company overview zoomd technologies provides digital marketing solutions focused on user acquisition primarily in the mobile space. the company operates beyond the usual google and meta channels offering clients access to a range of media sources. this gives advertisers flexibility and allows them to diversify their marketing efforts all managed from one platform. highlights zoomd s q2 2024 results showed impressive growth with revenue jumping by 58 compared to the same quarter last year. they brought in $13.98m in q2 2024 up from $8.82m in q2 2023. what stands out most is their net profit of $2.15m a clear turnaround from the $785k loss they reported in the same period last year. this also makes it their fifth quarter in a row of profitability which shows that their recent efforts to refocus the business are working. cost control has been a big part of the story. they cut operating expenses by 21 which helped boost their adjusted ebitda to $3.03m nearly 700 higher than last year. the company s move to discontinue less profitable products and concentrate on core services has paid off. what caught my eye about zoomd is how they ve set themselves apart from the typical google and meta reliance. they give advertisers the flexibility to use a wider range of channels like sdk networks and programmatic ads which opens up more options and control for their clients. this is why i see a lot of room for zoomd to grow. as more advertisers look for ways to diversify and spread their marketing dollars beyond the big players zoomd is well positioned to benefit from that shift on the client side retention is solid. over 90 of their top customers have stuck around for more than three years which obviously shows that once companies start working with zoomd they see enough value to stay on board long term. kraken robotics inc. $krknf $png.v market cap 400m company overview kraken robotics is a canadian marine technology company specializing in advanced sonar and optical sensors subsea batteries and robotics for unmanned underwater vehicles. they serve both military and commercial sectors offering solutions that include high resolution imaging for defence offshore energy and subsea infrastructure monitoring. highlights kraken s q2 2024 results were impressive with revenue climbing 67 to $22.8m compared to $13.7m in q2 2023. the bulk of this growth came from product sales which jumped 83 thanks to continued demand for key offerings like their subsea batteries and katfish system. kraken ended q2 with $20.4m in cash boosted by a $20m equity financing and $45m in new credit facilities. this solid financial foundation supports kraken s ambitious growth plans including ramping up production and expanding into new markets with projected 2024 revenue of $90m $100m and ebitda of $18m $24m. kraken has been steadily building an impressive pipeline of contracts. they ve recently secured more than $8m in subsea battery orders along with an $8m acoustic corer project and a $3.7m katfish related order. these deals are part of a broader pipeline kraken estimates to be worth over $900m in identified opportunities. kraken has locked in some big multi year deals with major clients like nato navies and the canadian navy. their ability to keep key customers coming back including large players in offshore energy really shows how much trust there is in kraken s technology and the value they consistently deliver in both defence and commercial markets. kraken just seems like a solid bet at this point. some may find it a bit expensive but if they hit their projected revenue of 90m 100m that would be their fourth year in a row of nearly doubling their revenue. the company is just firing on all cylinders. bolt metals corp. $pcrcf $bolt.cn market cap 4m company overview bolt metals corp. is a canadian exploration company focused on securing and advancing key metals projects in north america. their portfolio is centred on critical metals like antimony and copper. highlights what i like about bolt is that they have some super promising projects that are largely unexplored despite strong historical results. the new britain antimony and gold project in british columbia for example spans over 2 400 hectares and has already shown high grade samples including 10.4 antimony 9.7 g t gold and 2 358 g t silver. these numbers are impressive but what s even more intriguing is that the site remains mostly untouched when it comes to modern exploration. for those of you who have no idea what antimony is don t worry i didn t either. but it turns out that this critical metal has been experiencing a supply crunch and the price has nearly doubled in 2024. china which controls the majority of the world s antimony production has tightened exports which has driven prices up dramatically. with barely any domestic companies exploring for antimony this only scarcity boosts bolt metals position. soap gulch is their other promising asset in bolt s portfolio with great potential for copper and zinc. historical drilling has already delivered copper grades as high as 4.7 along with solid results in zinc and gold. what makes this project even more exciting is the opportunity bolt has to leverage existing data. they ve got 5 000 meters of historical drill core that has never been sampled for copper. this is a huge advantage as they can analyze this core without having to launch an expensive new drilling program potentially saving them around cad $3.4 million. on top of that a 2018 airborne geophysics survey identified several untested anomalies which are essentially indicators of subsurface structures that might contain additional mineral deposits. these anomalies suggest that there could be even more copper and zinc hidden beneath the surface adding to the project s untapped potential. if bolt can confirm what the historical data hints at soap gulch could become a valuable copper play in a strong market. plus it looks like bolt metals is about to add another promising project to their portfolio with the silver switchback property. early surface sampling has shown impressive results with 1 975 g t silver 17.01 copper and 0.48 g t gold. the property has never been drilled but the existing permit is valid until 2027 making it drill ready too. management is excited about this one and sees it as a key part of their growth plan with a solid exploration program in the works to uncover more silver and copper. it could definitely be a strong addition to their portfolio. all of this while still maintaining a strong cap structure. bolt has a tight share structure with only 8.9m shares fully diluted and 42 insider ownership. if you made it this far thanks for reading keep in mind that none of this is financial advice and i highly suggest doing your own research before chucking your hard earned money into a stock you saw through a random dude on reddit. $zomd $krknf $png $pcrcf $bolt

2024-09-30,2024-09-30 21:54:40,TSLA,Tesla,pennystocks,the race for u.s. lithium independence in the ev revolution the race for u.s. lithium independence in the ev revolution [TITLE_END] lithium demand is projected to quadruple by 2030 driven by the electric vehicle boom and increasing global energy storage needs. li ft power has strengthened its lithium portfolio through key projects in canada including its recent acquisition of 9 681 hectares in the little nahanni pegmatite district. with a price target of $9.25 cad and a potential upside of 240 li ft power offers a strong investment opportunity in the growing lithium market. the electric vehicle boom led by companies like tesla nio and stellantis has brought global attention to lithium a vital resource for the ev industry. governments and corporations are racing to secure it for future energy needs. despite having its own lithium reserves the united states currently produces only 1 of the global supply making it heavily dependent on foreign sources especially china. to safeguard its energy future and reduce reliance on geopolitical rivals the u.s. must ramp up domestic lithium production significantly. lithium abundance vs. production concentration though lithium is widely distributed across the globe its production is dominated by a handful of countries. australia chile china and argentina produce over 95 of the world s lithium. however the united states holds significant untapped reserves particularly in nevada north carolina and california. these states are estimated to contain about 4 of the world s lithium deposits making the u.s. home to some of the largest reserves outside the lithium triangle in south america. despite this u.s. production remains limited compared to global leaders. as the electric vehicle industry accelerates lithium demand is projected to surge. benchmark mineral intelligence forecasts that by 2030 annual lithium demand will hit 2.4 million tons four times the expected production for 2024. to support this growing need the inflation reduction act introduces $370 billion in incentives for domestic ev and battery production aiming to reduce reliance on imports. additionally earlier in 2023 the department of energy committed $3 billion to boost the u.s. ev supply chain following the bipartisan infrastructure law s passage which further emphasizes localizing production and bolstering the clean energy industry. this initiative is going to coordinate the effort across the federal government and work closely with the private sector labor unions tribes community organizations and our partners and allies abroad it s going to secure america s electric vehicle battery supply chain and clean energy future president joe biden china s strategic control over the lithium supply chain china s dominance over the global lithium supply chain is a result of strategic investments and policies aimed at controlling critical minerals. according to a 2021 white house report between 2009 and 2019 china funneled $100 billion in subsidies rebates and tax exemptions to its companies and consumers to capture the lithium refining market before demand skyrocketed. this gave china a powerful position as both the largest consumer of unrefined lithium and the leading producer of refined lithium. china has employed anti competitive tactics such as subsidizing production even when demand was low and dumping products at below market prices to outcompete international players. chinese companies have also invested heavily in lithium mines around the world ensuring their access to the supply. this strategy mirrors china s actions in controlling other critical minerals like cobalt graphite and nickel further entrenching its global mineral dominance. america must reduce its reliance on china and other adversaries for critical minerals our nation s dependence on foreign sources for these materials creates a serious threat to our national and economic security senator gary peters my stock pick li ft power for america s independency the reason why i am mentioning li ft power is because the company focuses on acquiring exploring and developing high potential lithium pegmatite projects in canada. its flagship asset the yellowknife lithium project in the northwest territories is key covering a large portion of the yellowknife pegmatite province known for significant lithium pegmatite formations. along with this li ft holds three promising early stage exploration properties in quebec and is advancing the cali project in the little nahanni pegmatite group further strengthening its position in the lithium market. on september 3 2024 li ft power announced a significant expansion of its operational area in the little nahanni pegmatite district located in the northwest territories canada. the company acquired an additional 9 681 hectares at its cali project which includes outcropping spodumene pegmatites a crucial lithium bearing mineral linked to the broader cali dyke swarm that the company has been actively mapping. this expansion was made possible following the n ts hch oh amendments to the saht land use plan in june 2024 which provided new opportunities for staking claims in the region. these amendments were expected after receiving endorsement from the saht secretariat incorporated and the government of the northwest territories back in 2019. as of september 20 2024 li ft power s stock is trading at $2.72 cad with a market capitalization of $107.24 million cad. in terms of future projections analysts have set a 12 month price target of $9.25 cad representing a potential upside of 240.07 with estimates ranging from a low of $8.50 cad to a high of $10.00 cad. the company s share structure includes 42.7 million outstanding shares and an additional 1.07 million options for a fully diluted total of 43.8 million shares. ownership remains concentrated with 55 held by founders 17 by institutional investors 25 by retail investors and 3 by management and directors. top institutional shareholders include commodity capital ag extract capital and tribeca investment partners. conclusion lithium is becoming an increasingly vital resource as the demand for electric vehicles surges yet production remains concentrated in a few countries like australia chile china and argentina. while the u.s. holds significant untapped reserves production has not kept pace with global leaders. to address this the inflation reduction act and bipartisan infrastructure law provide substantial funding to boost domestic lithium production and reduce reliance on china which dominates the lithium refining market. companies like li ft power are poised to benefit from these trends with their strategic lithium projects in canada. recent expansions in the northwest territories position li ft to capitalize on rising demand. with analysts projecting a 240 stock price increase li ft offers strong growth potential supported by its concentrated ownership and promising lithium assets.

[TITLE_END] almost 90 days ago i made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why i believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days essentially the crash will begin by the day before

expediting things today. nonetheless i think the post is super relevant and for some reason the moderators of wsb deleted the post after 6 hours despite it receiving over 2.2 million views and over 1100 shares. the ride the market has been on quite simply has been insane. according to generally accepted wisdom by investing in the s p 500 you can anticipate to double your money on average every

while the last two cycles don t necessarily ring any alarm bells we have just more than doubled twice looking at the last two cycles there is one massive bloated shit filled elephant in the room... price to earnings ratio. historically the price to earnings ratio for the s p has sat just under 20 . the median value has it under 18x and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at 10x. currently the p e ratio sits at 28.71 roughly 150 of what is normal. in the history of the s p the p e ratio has hit this level only 3 times... immediately preceding and then during the dot com bubble . immediately preceding and then during the global financial crisis . the quarter after covid hit. . images aren t allowed in this subreddit but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday 09 30 at a p e of 30.07 historically what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark in all three scenarios by the time we crossed a p e of 30 the dam had already started to break. during the dot com bubble the s p 500 was already down 19 from its highs and would fall another 34 before finally starting to recover. by the the time the bleeding stopped it had lost 47 of its value. during the global financial crisis an almost identical story can be told. the s p had lost 18 of its value by time p e broke 30 and when it finally bottomed out in february of 2009 it lost 53 of its total value. covid obviously was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32 and had bounced back in less than 6 months time . okay so maybe we have a price to earnings ratio problem but you re still not sold. what else do we have going on outside of the fact that i firmly believe that the market is overvalued today i think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment and while i could write a diatribe for each for purposes of succinctness i ll simply outline them via bullet points below. credit card debt is at an all time high and outside of a brief period after covid checks arrived has been rising since 2013. younger americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. as boomers continue to retire it will be the working class most disproportionately affected. credit card delinquency rates are the highest they ve been since 2011. auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they ve been at any point in history. auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they ve been since 2010. the stock market is insanely top heavy right now. the magnificent 7 amazon apple meta microsoft nvidia and tesla now account for 45 of the entire value of the nasdaq. they account for roughly 30 of the entire stock market combined. as of today they are trading at a combined p e of 42x. a correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole. we are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. furthermore i do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. i think many of the jobs added over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences. many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. while this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst some of the largest banks including bank of america charles schwab and usaa have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50 of their equity capital. regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of us treasury notes they hold that were bought during covid. in short nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. banks flush with cash took said money and bought us t notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. this was at a time when interest rates were very low. now that interest rates are high demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. if any sort of bank run starts these banks will be forced to liquidate said t bills and they will have to sell them at a loss. if too many people do this simultaneously the bank will become insolvent like what we saw happen with silicon valley bank signature bank and first republic bank. . the us government still has a spending problem. our deficit has grown by $500 million since i started writing this an hour ago. global tensions are high and rising. massive protests are erupting all over europe. the us is involved in two proxy wars that don t appear as if they will abate any time soon. the political division in the us is as dramatic as i ve seen it at any point in my existence. perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here but it seems most are resorting to tribal identity politics split down party lines. commercial real estate is starting to buckle. covid brought about work from home and with many offices retaining those practices or allowing partial work from home office space supply far outpaces demand. this problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. when that balloon is bout to come due the owner of that property will refinance the loan restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020 during covid when rates bottomed out are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. however with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago and vacancy rates skyrocketing many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. commercial real estate foreclosures jumped 117 in march alone. housing has become increasingly less affordable for many americans. for 2022 the most recent year i could find data a family earning the median us household income renting a median priced us home was spending 40 of their income on rent. countries are abandoning the us dollar in droves. i believe some of these issues on their own are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. bundled together i don t see how we aren t in for a very rude awakening. this economic downturn may be severe. in the three times this has happened before the action or lake thereof varied dramatically. during scenario one the dot com bubble the government largely just let the companies fail. while i was only 11 at the time my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies unlike scenario two. during the gfc shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the us financial system. while i won t get into partisan politics i m of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary and more importantly for this post the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic. bailouts on any level whether to companies banks or directly to citizens will inevitably increase inflation. i don t think they are on the table for this correction. people have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... and while supply chain issues didn t help i think the bigger issue by far was the sheer amount of money we printed. you cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn t going to suddenly become worth less money. we just lived through this reality after the covid printing. this will largely tie the feds hands. print more money we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates. what happens from here i don t know. don t listen to me. i m an idiot. stock market will probably just continue to go up. i m probably wrong about 100 of this. the prediction in bold below is what i posted 90 days ago. i now believe the top is officially in that we won t see another ath for a long time. my prediction gspc spy cruise up a tiny bit further to $5900 $590 before retreating to $3500 $350 by 12 2025. my positions bought 50 $570 10 2 puts at open this morning right at open. i m up

any point in history. auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they ve been since 2010. the stock market is insanely top heavy right now. the magnificent 7 amazon apple meta microsoft nvidia and tesla now account for 45 of the entire value of the nasdaq. they account for roughly 30 of the entire stock market combined. as of today they are trading at a combined p e of 42x. a correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole. we are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. furthermore i do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. i think many of the jobs added over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences. many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. while this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst some of the largest banks including bank of america charles schwab and usaa have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50 of their equity capital. regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of us treasury notes they hold that were bought during covid. in short nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. banks flush with cash took said money and bought us t notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. this was at a time when interest rates were very low. now that interest rates are high demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. if any sort of bank run starts these banks will be forced to liquidate said t bills and they will have to sell them at a loss. if too many people do this simultaneously the bank will become insolvent like what we saw happen with silicon valley bank signature bank and first republic bank. . the us government still has a spending problem. our deficit has grown by $500 million since i started writing this an hour ago. global tensions are high and rising. massive protests are erupting all over europe. the us is involved in two proxy wars that don t appear as if they will abate any time soon. the political division in the us is as dramatic as i ve seen it at any point in my existence. perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here but it seems most are resorting to tribal identity politics split down party lines. commercial real estate is starting to buckle. covid brought about work from home and with many offices retaining those practices or allowing partial work from home office space supply far outpaces demand. this problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. when that balloon is bout to come due the owner of that property will refinance the loan restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020 during covid when rates bottomed out are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. however with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago and vacancy rates skyrocketing many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. commercial real estate foreclosures jumped 117 in march alone. housing has become increasingly less affordable for many americans. for 2022 the most recent year i could find data a family earning the median us household income renting a median priced us home was spending 40 of their income on rent. countries are abandoning the us dollar in droves. i believe some of these issues on their own are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. bundled together i don t see how we aren t in for a very rude awakening. this economic downturn may be severe. in the three times this has happened before the action or lake thereof varied dramatically. during scenario one the dot com bubble the government largely just let the companies fail. while i was only 11 at the time my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies unlike scenario two. during the gfc shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the us financial system. while i won t get into partisan politics i m of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary and more importantly for this post the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic. bailouts on any level whether to companies banks or directly to citizens will inevitably increase inflation. i don t think they are on the table for this correction. people have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... and while supply chain issues didn t help i think the bigger issue by far was the sheer amount of money we printed. you cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn t going to suddenly become worth less money. we just lived through this reality after the covid printing. this will largely tie the feds hands. print more money we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates. what happens from here i don t know. don t listen to me. i m an idiot. stock market will probably just continue to go up. i m probably wrong about 100 of this. the prediction in bold below is what i posted 90 days ago. i now believe the top is officially in that we won t see another ath for a long time. my prediction gspc spy cruise up a tiny bit further to $5900 $590 before retreating to $3500 $350 by 12 2025. my positions bought 50 $570 10 2 puts at open this morning right at open. i m up

2024-10-02,2024-10-02 15:10:06,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,tesla stock slips after it reports 462 890 total deliveries during the third quarter tesla stock slips after it reports 462 890 total deliveries during the third quarter [TITLE_END] tesla posted its third quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on wednesday. the stock fell about 2 in premarket trading after the report. here are the key numbers total deliveries q3 2024 462 890 total production q3 2024 469 796 analysts were expecting deliveries of 463 310 in the period ending sept. 30 according to estimates compiled by factset streetaccount. deliveries are not defined in tesla s financial disclosures but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. it s one of the most closely watched metrics on wall street. in the year ago period tesla reported 435 059 deliveries and production of 430 488 evs. last quarter the company reported 443 956 deliveries and production of 410 831 vehicles. tesla is facing increased competitive pressure especially in china from companies like byd and geely along with a new generation of automakers including li auto and nio. in the u.s. ev competitors like rivian are maturing while legacy automakers ford and general motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification. gm this week reported a roughly 60 increase in ev sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. still its electric business is tiny compared to tesla s with just 32 100 units sold in the latest period accounting for 4.9 of the company s total sales. ford plans to report results on wednesday. tesla hasn t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle the angular stainless steel cybertruck to their lineup. the company also said on wednesday that it deployed 6.9 gwh of energy storage products in the quarter. shares of tesla climbed 32 in the third quarter erasing their loss for the year in the process. the stock is now up almost 4 in 2024 trailing the nasdaq which has gained 19 . tesla s brand has been under pressure in the u.s. due in part to the antics of ceo elon musk who in addition to endorsing former president donald trump has shared what the white house called racist hate and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on x his social media app. but tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the u.s. than any other automaker with hyundai a distant second. in its third quarter earnings report later this month investors will be particularly focused on profit margins. tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in china as well as in the u.s. prior to earnings tesla will host a marketing event on oct. 10 and is expected to show off the design of dedicated robotaxi. musk has promised tesla self driving cars for years but the company has yet to deliver. meanwhile competitors like waymo and pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services. source

[TITLE_END] driverless cars are speeding onto america s streets but whether the public will trust robotaxis remains an open question. nearly two thirds of americans said they would not want to ride in a driverless passenger vehicle if they had the opportunity according to a pew research center survey. that s because residents in cities that have yet to experience robotaxis remain unfamiliar with the technology while those in cities with driverless cabs have not yet forgotten about high profile accidents involving other companies like gm owned cruise. now tesla the loudest and most bullish self driving proponent of them all is due to unveil its long awaited robotaxi after years of unfulfilled promises. the company s existing autonomous driving technology where a human is still at the wheel has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and multiple lawsuits after hundreds of crashes. experts say a great presentation from ceo elon musk won t guarantee a safe robotaxi network. tesla s upcoming robotaxi launch threatens to throw the whole autonomous vehicle space off course. alphabet owned waymo is the leader in the space with the company claiming it has notched more than 22 million driverless miles. it has proven that there is strong consumer demand with weekly paid rides in san francisco los angeles phoenix and austin doubling in just a couple months. and waymo has worked on building its reputation launching an online safety hub with data arguing that its cars are safer than human drivers. besides tesla other competitors are also looking to jump into the race. amazon says it is getting ready to roll out its fleet of zoox cars and cruise is resuming operations after a 2023 accident led regulators to ground the fleet. wall street is already looking ahead to a driverless future with one analyst arguing that if it hadn t been for generative ai 2024 would have been the year of the robotaxi. as driverless networks scale one of the fiercest debates is whether ride sharing will survive. robotaxis may cause consumers to question if they really want to book an uber or lyft and talk to a stranger sit in someone else s car and tip a human if there is a driverless alternative. uber has hedged its bets by inking high profile deals with autonomous vehicle companies but it s unclear how long those partnerships will last.

[TITLE_END] hey i m really new to stock market and trading in general. i m mainly a programmer and only a bystander in trading. in 2020 i realized nvidia was doing really good they also had their investments in a lot of technologies finally start to pay off and even if you exclude the c rypt0 frenzy it was somewhat clear that nvidia was nourishing. at least to me as a programmer i thought they had a ton of technological dominance and advancements in various areas. and especially in 2022 when ai stuff popped up if it wasn t clear before that with all the research and investments they were doing in ai ml space like it should be clear by that point with image generation llms and openai popping off and all of them relying on nvidia. but the stock price was still at 15 usd at maximum in 2022. at that time i had literally 0 knowledge in the stock market and thought maybe this is nvidia s value and this value includes all the new things and market is aware of nvidia. but in hindsight nvidia was overly undervalued and the market was simply not aware of it. maybe it was clear to me because nvidia is in my domain but am i missing something for example i also get the same vibes with tesla. yes it is crazily valued at the moment but still with the event they held yesterday and overall their direction even if everyone hates elon musk it also seems clear to me that tesla will pack a lot more than what it currently is. the robotaxis tesla robot their battery techs their knowledge in vision and ml and a lot more things will start to pay off eventually. after the event i expected today to see a growth in tesla but it was down by 3 is everyone waiting a lower point of entry or are people just not impressed by the event and the promises what am i not understanding and missing here

2024-10-11,2024-10-11 18:45:39,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,tesla is completely out of touch with needs of taxi services. tesla is completely out of touch with needs of taxi services. [TITLE_END] seeing a lot of focus on the temu boston dynamics bot but not a lot of discussion on the robo taxi. how this thing is built tells me how out of touch and unprepared tesla is to seriously compete in ride servicing. first off this thing has two seats that alone is such a dumb design decision. it had to be elon that said to keep it as two seats so it looks futuristic and aesthetic. what if i want to travel with a small group of people i m not using the lax shuttle van at that point i m immediately turning to a competitor. haven t really seen anyone comment on how out of touch and unnecessary that was. one other concern i have is how tesla primarily uses cameras. what if there are sirens and a fire truck ambulance or police car is blowing through an intersection. other autonomous vehicles incorporate sound i m not too sure tesla does. if not it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. beyond this there s the ridiculous price tag he put on it which it ll probably be nowhere close to. what are other people s thoughts on this did anything with this robotaxi actually look like a feasible product to you it looks like an aesthetic toy but not an actual product that can compete in the space. based on my understanding of a typical car design cycle redesigning this to add four instead of just 2 seats would take probably another 2 4 years at least. to me it seems like they really just showed they lost on their biggest bet in the near future. edit alright read through the comments and still think the 2 seat no steering wheel design is stupid. people are saying this is meant to also be a personal commuter car. so my choices are to buy a 30k robotaxi and then also get a model 3 or model y to drive around my family for another 40k when i can just get one model 3 or any other self driving car no robotaxi and do everything i need how is that budget friendly at all and if there s a nicer car with a steering wheel that self drives why would i buy something without the option of a steering wheel still a toy. also if it s for personal use how does this know where to park at my office or how to get past a security gate to private property if i live in a condo building with a garage how does it know how to get out of the parking garage and where my parking space is it makes no sense as a personal car for a lot of people. and even if the majority of taxi rides are 1 2 people why not just use a model 3 that s 10k more already exists and can service that additional 15 20 of your taxi market . you also save on all the costs that it took to make a stupid 2 seater when it came to expanding production lines capacity testing and designing the pointless thing. my opinion doesn t change this thing shouldn t exist and it s out of touch with what most people need. total waste of time when they could ve focused on actually competing with growing competition in the normal car space where they re losing their competitive advantage. there s a reason why uber and the ex waymo ceo were not impressed.

2024-10-18,2024-10-18 07:03:01,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,large cap tech nvidia and by extension us index funds are likely to crash small cap value international to outperform. here s why large cap tech nvidia and by extension us index funds are likely to crash small cap value international to outperform. here s why [TITLE_END] if you look at the story of how the s p500 has performed so well over the past decade the answer is high return on invested capital from tech companies. by hiring top engineers to build innovative products and scaling the product globally these companies to achieved rapid growth at little cost resulting in impressive returns to shareholders. historically hardware costs were very cheap to scale compared to the revenue it brings in. you could spend a few thousand per month in hosting costs and bring in millions in profits. however this is changing. 7 out of 10 of the top holdings in the s p500 are gambling huge on ai they have laid off tens of thousands of the talented engineers that drove their earnings growth in order to fund expensive acquisitions of ai hardware. tech can no longer be seen as an industry with low capital costs because ai is tremendously expensive to deploy and maintain. for example microsoft expects to spend $100 billion on ai datacenters through fiscal 2027. that s 40 more than their entire profit in 2023. because ai hardware is so expensive and the electricity usage is so tremendous these future applications are no longer cheap to deploy and maintain. chatgpt is perhaps the best example of this. despite being tremendously successful from a growth perspective it has been tremendously unprofitable from an operating standpoint and relies on continued bailouts from large companies like microsoft nvidia and softbank to stay afloat. the economics of tech companies is quickly changing with companies in an arms race to acquire as many nvidia chips as possible to build the best genai applications they are hurting their margins and operating profitability. the impact of these investments has been quite lousy so far other than some round tripping transactions to create fake revenue and balance sheet growth these ai investments while tremendously expensive have not paid off microsoft s copilot has been a complete failure consumers are not buying copilot pcs and the copilot app has a 2.3 star rating on the windows store. they are also facing regulatory pressure in europe over recall. google s ai is providing dangerous and potentially deadly misinformation to users of its search engine such as incorrect advice about prescriptions. amazon s go stores were supposed to use ml ai to handle checkouts when in reality the ai failed to handle most of the work and the remainder was just outsourced to human operators in india which struggled to keep up with the workload. tesla has still failed to implement full self driving and during its robotaxi event had human actors control the robots to fake them being ai controlled. google s waymo is very impressive from a technology standpoint but its hardware costs and regulatory barriers make it unlikely to achieve profitability even as it expands. despite the poor results of ai investments so far all of the top 10 holdings in the s p500 other than berkshire hathaway trade at very high p e ratio suggesting that very high earnings growth is priced in. even if ai will have a significant impact on the economy and society the economics of it are not favorable to investors due to the high capex costs involved. tech is no longer an industry where a team of 10 20 engineers can build a product that brings in billions in revenue with minimal hosting costs. it is now an industry where billions of capital expenditures are needed just to build a model and margins on the finished product are very poor. of course tech ceos realize this which is why microsoft openai and google are all working to replace nvidia hardware which sells at a huge markup with their own in house chips. this is a tremendous threat to nvidia s long term prospects. given the high expectations implied by elevated price to earnings ratios and the poor financial performance of ai applications it does seem quite unlikely that large caps will continue to outperform. small cap value and international stocks are almost certainly a better investment if ai does drive significant productivity improvements then labor heavy businesses will benefit from improved margins from using these products that large tech companies are offering. looking at small cap value funds like avuv and international stock indexes there are a tremendous amount of labor intensive businesses with low margins in these funds that would benefit from ai ml. net margins going from 3 to 10 due to improved productivity would mean earnings more than tripling. this has historically been the case with technical revolutions. for example railroads revolutionized our economy and drove tremendous economic growth but they provided terrible returns to shareholders.

2024-10-23,2024-10-23 14:35:32,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,alphabet to $7 trillion by 2025 alphabet to $7 trillion by 2025 [TITLE_END] we believe alphabet is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2 trillion figure now potentially becoming the world s most valuable company by a huge margin as its often overlooked waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. this would take the stock to over $500 a share. here s why. fact waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10 000 to over 100 000 in the last 12 months. it went from 50 000 weekly rides to 100 000 just in the last six months. the growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive case in point uber does more than 200 million rides each week. let s let that sink in. so if autonomous rides can capture even half that market that would mean 100 million rides per week. that s about 1 000 times where waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. at $30 per ride we re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year. but wait there is more to the growth story if waymo is already delivering over 100 000 driverless rides how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles the shift could be massive. for each person hailing a cab there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat streaming netflix while they re stuck behind the wheel. in fact early data backs this up. according to earnest analytics waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride hailing services like uber or lyft. people enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. safety could also be another attraction. waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85 reduction in injury causing crashes compared to national rates for human operated cars. investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride hailing market has substantial growth potential it could easily expand by 2 3x. a $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn t out of the question. this growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like tesla which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies. but wait aren t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving yes but not all of them are making the same progress. waymo has a head start in the market. its main competitor general motor s backed cruise lost its driverless permits in california after a serious accident making waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in san francisco. uber exited its self driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with waymo to bring its services to the uber app in some cities. while electric vehicle behemoth tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self driving space given its large base of vehicles it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its robotaxi vehicle earlier this month. waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. it uses a fleet equipped with high resolution cameras lidar and radar systems creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. and don t forget google s got a secret weapon. it crowdsources annotated data such as captcha codes from its massive user base using that to train its machine learning models. that s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments. the best part these are self driving cars no human drivers no unions no employee or contractor issues and no human cost. while there will be other expenses such as software development and battery costs the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. margins of 50 aren t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride hailing models. if waymo can capture about one third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. with a 50 margin that s a neat $150 billion in profits. what s that worth at a 30x earnings multiple that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for alphabet. considering that alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently this could take the company s market cap to over $6.5 trillion or over $500 per share. to be sure building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time quite different from signing up for say a google or netflix account. however investors will need to look well out into the future. think 2030 maybe even more. the point is not to get stuck if you re concerned look even further out say 2035 the bottom line alphabet is growing waymo quickly has the technology and competitive edge and is addressing a potentially massive market making this high valuation within reach. source alphabet to $7 trillion by 2025

[TITLE_END] it may surprise some to learn that tesla isn t really in the car business. sure some 80 of its revenue currently comes from electric vehicles. and ceo elon musk is pretty good at squeezing profit out of those cars something many in the industry still haven t managed to figure out. but the most important thing to know about the company is that it trades on more than 70 times forward earnings. ford and general motors are on five or six times. this suggests that when investors buy tesla stock their expectations are in a different universe from when they buy into other car makers. musk is pulling old school levers to ensure his cars are profitable even as rivals churn out lower cost models. it helps that tesla can now make more vehicles from the same manufacturing base and squeeze suppliers to cushion margins. at the same time a closer look at the earnings yesterday which beat wall street estimates show tesla s profits come from plenty of other sources. it made money from software from selling regulatory credits for making more than its share of zero emission cars and from battery storage and charging. of course robotaxis and self driving cars are the next frontier. they re not really cars the robotaxi won t even have a steering wheel or pedals. they are a bet on technology and artificial intelligence not the automotive industry. it s why tesla is one of nvidia s best customers. there s a story about ray kroc the businessman who made mcdonald s the most successful fast food corporation and the value of knowing exactly what business you re really in. for mcdonald s it s real estate not hamburgers. elon musk knows he s not in the car business. he s selling the future. the tricky part will be delivering on his promises when expectations are already so high. brian swint

2024-10-24,2024-10-24 18:39:50,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",investing,pm was a good buy before earnings but why pm was a good buy before earnings but why [TITLE_END] i just thought pm showed a good example that the price fell going into earnings and ends up pushing higher after earnings. i would argue through much experience that this is typical in both directions. i therefore expect msft to do similar and meta is a bit neutral. the rationale is the price is moving against the direction of the bet to increase the cost of the bet. if you know how betting works that s exactly how it works. look at the presidential election bets on polymarkets trump is more expensive to bet yes than kamala. how does price moving down mean a more expensive upside bet simple the price has to move more to break even or be profitable for a trader. this phenomenon is opposite to gambling such as sports betting. which can be explained by how the payout works because the payout isn t a pot of money but a share that then has to be sold by the counterparty . what does this have to do with investing i think a lot of people get this backward. they buy a stock ahead of earnings anticipating good earnings and then the stock does the opposite of what they expect for a time sometimes even a little after the earnings volatility is crushed. some people just hold through this volatility and never seem to figure out why it happens in the first place. but others get absolutely discouraged at timing their buying of shares of their stock and end up buying in a suboptimal way such as dca ing on the way up. i bought pm right before earnings because it moved down and i knew that for everyone to lose price had to move up that is where the bet breaks even. and sure enough it did. i like pm as a company i expected its earnings to be good so i expected that tailwind anyway. but i timed my buy to a price of $114.62 with options. so i had a massive advantage going into the earnings purchase to stack my pm shares. lastly i wanted to point out that i bought pm very confidently because of pre earnings behavior that pm would go up even though i think to an untrained eye pm looks weak coming off an all time high and they would therefore assume it d continue to be weak. that going any higher would seem too much . but the market s cup runneth over regardless how absurd it may seem because of the recent run.
2024-10-24,2024-10-24 22:25:33,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,tesla soars to best day in 11 years after a blowout quarter tesla soars to best day in 11 years after a blowout quarter [TITLE_END] tesla inc. s shares surged the most in more than 11 years after the carmaker reported surprisingly strong earnings and forecast as much as 30 growth in vehicle sales next year. third quarter results were buoyed by tesla turning a corner with the cybertruck which generated profit for the first time. lower material costs an expanding energy business and sales of regulatory credits to automakers that need help complying with emissions limits also contributed to tesla s best quarterly earnings in more than a year. chief executive officer elon musk offered an upbeat outlook for 2025 citing the rollout of more affordable models that tesla has yet to identify. something like 20 to 30 growth next year is my best guess he said on a webcast. tesla s shares jumped 22 thursday in new york the biggest gain since may 2013. that helped add tens of billions of dollars to musk s net worth and sent the stock into positive territory for the year erasing a slump in the weeks since the ceo unveiled self driving taxi and van prototypes.
2024-10-24,2024-10-24 22:25:58,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,tesla stock has best day in over a decade on musk s 2025 growth projection tesla stock has best day in over a decade on musk s 2025 growth projection [TITLE_END] tesla shares soared 22 to close at $260.48 on thursday the stock s best day since 2013 following the company s better than expected earnings report. the company late wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion which came in just under analysts expectations of $25.37 billion but was up 8 compared with a year earlier. tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents. we expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in tesla shares thursday given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company analysts at jpmorgan wrote in a note. tesla s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits which the jpmorgan analysts noted were a potentially unsustainable driver of earnings and cash flow. automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year and if they can t meet the target they can buy credits from other companies. tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles. tesla earnings also got a boost from fsd the company s full self driving supervised system. cfo vaibhav taneja said on the earnings call that fsd contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after tesla made it available for use in the cybertruck and added a feature called actually smart summon. ceo elon musk said on the call that his best guess is that vehicle growth will reach 20 to 30 next year citing lower cost vehicles and the advent of autonomy. analysts surveyed by factset were expecting delivery growth of about 15 for 2025. even bullish deutsche bank analysts doubted musk s forecast and wrote in a note following the earnings report our view remains more reserved at 10 15 and assumes tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its model y at a price under $30 000 after subsidies and other variants of the small suv. analysts at morgan stanley who also recommend buying the stock called musk s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a maybe. they set their estimate at 14 . it clearly depends on the company s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model introduction financing offers and improved features the morgan stanley analysts wrote in a note thursday. a grain of salt musk said on the wednesday call that tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled cybercab a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals by the end of 2026. he also said tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in california and texas next year in its existing cars which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time. bernstein analysts who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of tesla wrote in a note out thursday the tone of tesla s conference call was ebullient and filled with musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors and was more akin to a pep rally with the company only taking two questions from sell siders. musk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn teslas into robotaxis. that hasn t happened yet. musk has also promised a refreshed version of the tesla roadster since 2017. the design of the vehicle is not yet complete. the bernstein analysts wrote we continue to struggle to see tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis and believe fully unsupervised fsd could be years away. they pointed to musk s long history of being overly optimistic about fsd and said crowdsourced research that shows tesla continues to lag well behind competitors on robotaxis. the share rally thursday was the sharpest since a 24 gain in may 2013. the jump erased tesla s loss for the year and left the stock up 3 in 2024 though it still trails the 22 gain for the nasdaq. source

[TITLE_END] elsewhere i explained to someone that earnings tend to be moments of mean reversion and that despite good expectations meta was setting up to go down on earnings. sure enough it has. this is true with almost all earnings because like sports betting the more people who long a stock before earnings drives the price higher and for the market maker to break even they need to lose. the more who sell before earnings drives the price lower and for market maker to break even it needs to drive the price higher. it s all pretty basic auction theory spanning across earnings plays. they are very predictable and for that reason they usually mean revert the cost of the options a real tail wags dog scenario.

[TITLE_END] the s p 500 and the nasdaq composite were in a free fall today losing 1.9 and 2.8 respectively a rout as traders and investors turned their noses up at meta and microsoft s earnings. even google has given up its 5 gain from yesterday. matching the drop the vix closed at 23.16 and the 10 year treasury yield closed about the same at 4.29 . should apple and amazon disappoint post market today i think a correction could be on. the main bullish factor countering a volatile election week a vix over 23 and high yields of 4.3 is strong earnings especially from the m 7. clearly that doesn t seem to be happening. meta initially it seemed like a perfunctory one percent drop on a small beat and in line guidance but it s gone a lot further as meta is down 4 to 570. why the rout analysts and investors panned high capex plans of $40bn and costly high risk bets such as meta s reality labs unit which logged a staggering operating loss of $4.4 billion microsoft is getting clobbered for a different reason. even as azure grew 34 the pace wasn t enough and guidance of 31 to 32 in constant currency was lower than expected. however this is due to supply chain constraints as president amy hood noted that the 1 or 2 point deceleration microsoft has guided is mainly due to some supply pushouts in terms of ai supply coming online that the company counted on. we expect consumption growth to be stable compared to q1 and we expect to add more sequential dollars to azure than any other quarter in history hood added. the indomitable dan ives of wedbush remains as bullish as ever we actually disagree with this initial take as the new azure reporting standards have moved street numbers all around and a slight deceleration is totally expected by many investors with some supply constraints and reacceleration in 2h25 and we would be strong buyers of msft on any weakness this morning wedbush analysts led by daniel ives said in a note.

2024 stocksy s weekly dd [TITLE_END] hey everyone here are some notes on some of my favourite plays atm. mccoy has been recommended to me several times on past post and now i understand why solid company. still just waiting on these glm drill results and i just like zomd s growth prospects. hope this dd can be of value to anyone. please feel free to recommend any tickers you would like me to check out cheers mccoy global $mccrf $mcb.to market cap 99m company overview mccoy global develops equipment and technology for the energy and industrial sectors especially oil and gas. their lineup includes tools like hydraulic power tongs and digital solutions like smarthub and virtual thread rep which are designed to streamline operations and bring data insights to drilling sites. highlights mccoy s last quarter was pretty solid. they pulled in $19.9m in revenue up 23 from last year . earnings had a major boost too. net income shot up by 119 landing at $3.1m compared to $1.4m last year. one big reason mccoy s doing well is their fms tool. this tool makes the process of handling pipes a lot easier and safer. instead of needing extra manual tools the fms has replaceable parts that grip and release pipes quickly which means fewer crew members are needed on the job. this setup saves both time and money for operators which is why field crews are starting to rely on it especially in tough conditions where efficiency and safety are key. simply put the fms is solving real problems and that s why it s boosting mccoy s sales. mccoy s growth is also coming from a big push into international markets especially in the eastern hemisphere. they used to be focused mainly on north america but now around 60 of their revenue is coming from overseas. this matters because it makes them less dependent on any one region. their tools like the fms are catching on with companies abroad who are focused on efficiency. by spreading their business across more markets they set themselves up with a more reliable revenue stream even if one area slows down. also they got $9 million in cash and no debt giving them the flexibility to keep growing without needing outside financing zoomd technologies ltd. $zmdtf $zomd.v market cap 52m company overview zoomd operates in the digital ad tech space specializing in mobile focused kpi driven advertising solutions. their tech helps brands navigate advertising channels outside major platforms like google and meta providing a unified service for customer acquisition across various media types. zoomd s platform allows clients to efficiently manage and optimize ad campaigns on multiple channels from social media to programmatic ad networks all while maintaining clear kpi based results. highlights zoomd brought in $22.7 million in revenue in the first half of 2024 up 30 from last year. by focusing in on their core high performing products they ve made a strong turnaround with net income hitting $2.1 million in q2 2024 compared to previous losses. they cut operating expenses by 21 which helped drive adjusted ebitda to $3.03m nearly 700 higher than last year. this shift toward core services and discontinuing less profitable products is clearly doing well for them. zoomd s approach is a big plus for brands aiming to grow internationally. their platform makes reaching audiences across regions like north america and europe easier by offering a range of media options so brands aren t limited by regional ad restrictions. this flexibility gives companies the reach they need to effectively connect with global markets. another strength for zoomd is their client retention. their top 10 clients have stayed with them for over three years on average which speaks to strong client satisfaction and effective campaign management. with this high retention and a diverse client base zoomd is building a steady stream of recurring revenue as they continue to expand globally. golden lake exploration $golxf $glm.cn market cap 6m company overview golden lake exploration is a junior mining company focused on the jewel ridge property in nevada s battle mountain eureka gold trend a prolific gold producing area. highlights jewel ridge is in a great location within the battle mountain eureka trend an area that has produced over 40 million ounces of gold historically. this site is surrounded by major projects like i 80 gold s ruby hill which has over 7.73 million ounces of gold and mcewen mining s gold bar project. historical drilling at jewel ridge has shown promising results. notable intercepts include 56.39 meters of 1.24 g t gold and 10.67 meters of 4.79 g t gold. the eureka tunnel target is another highlight yielding 3.23 meters of 57.16 g t gold 452.03 g t silver 7.23 lead and 11.99 zinc . this intercept resulted in eric sprott building a position in the company as one of the top shareholders. i m mentioning glm in this post because they just recently started drilling and have some very promising targets. one of the key areas is magnet ridge which spans an 800 meter long anomaly in a well known gold corridor. this anomaly was identified through geophysical surveys and shows a strong chargeability response hinting at the potential for sulphide minerals which are associated with precious metals. i m expecting these drill results to be released in the next few weeks. earlier drilling nearby hit 5.13 g t gold over 5.43 meters near the surface. now they re going deeper into the core of the anomaly where the chargeability is 10x stronger making it a much more interesting target. with promising geology and high priority drill spots this setup looks pretty solid. i just think there is a decent chance for some good finds and the current risk to reward isn t bad at all considering if they hit anything like they did in the past it could run hard in this market. plus that is only the target i am most optimistic about they have some other solid ones as well. thank you

2024-11-05,2024-11-05 15:05:41,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,musk now says it s pointless to build a $25 000 tesla for human drivers musk now says it s pointless to build a $25 000 tesla for human drivers [TITLE_END] so will there be any new car model for tesla in 2025 x200b musk now says it s pointless to build a $25 000 tesla for human drivers x200b when reuters reported in april that tesla had scrapped plans for a long promised next generation $25 000 electric vehicle the automaker s stock plunged. chief executive elon musk rushed to respond on x his social media network. reuters is lying he posted without elaborating. tesla s stock recovered some of its losses. six months later musk appears to have backed into an admission that tesla dropped its plans for a human driven $25 000 car. he said in an oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable ev would be pointless unless the car was fully autonomous. his latest remarks came in response to an investor asking when can we expect tesla to give us the $25 000 non robotaxi regular car model musk responded we re not making a non robo before he was interrupted by another tesla executive. musk later added basically i think having a regular $25k model is pointless. it would be silly. the april 5 reuters article reported that tesla had abandoned plans for an all new affordable mass market ev but still planned a self driving robotaxi. since then musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles. tesla and musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story. on the october earnings call musk said that tesla does plan a $25k car its cybercab a two door two seat fully autonomous vehicle. musk unveiled a prototype at a hollywood style event on oct. 10. musk says tesla will start production of the cybercab in 2026 after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current model 3 and model y vehicles in texas and california next year. the automaker faces steep technological regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on musk s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles which echo others dating back about a decade. an all new affordable tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of tesla s strategy to become the world s biggest automaker. for several years tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030 more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of toyota the current global sales leader. in may tesla dropped the 20 million goal from its latest impact report on progress toward sustainability goals. as recently as january of this year musk confirmed the plan for an all new affordable ev in an earnings call. he said the next generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major growth wave following the first wave with the release of its model 3 and model y vehicles in 2017 and 2020 respectively. investors and tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a model 2 slotting in below the model 3 currently the least expensive tesla starting at $42 490. in january musk described the all new model as requiring new revolutionary manufacturing technology. but in april after reuters reported tesla had scrapped the model 2 musk outlined a plan for more affordable models that could be produced on the same manufacturing lines as current teslas. seth goldstein a morningstar research services analyst said he believes these less expensive vehicles will be built on current tesla platforms and priced in the mid $30 000s. it was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more affordable vehicle on a new platform he told reuters. i think tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their chinese ev peers so they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle. after the april 5 reuters report that tesla had killed the model 2 musk posted that day on x saying tesla planned a robotaxi unveil in august. the event delayed until october and held on a movie set near los angeles underwhelmed wall street and drove a 9 drop in tesla shares the following day. some investors viewed musk s comments on the cybercab along with displays of an autonomous robovan concept and humanoid robots as short on concrete details about the products. tesla hasn t said whether the cybercab will feature new self driving technology beyond the company s full self driving feature in its current vehicles. its existing models can t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention. the target market for the cybercab isn t clear. the cybercab s sports car looks and two door two seat configuration a nearly extinct layout in the wider u.s. auto market puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage. musk in the october earnings call said the concept vehicle s design was optimized for autonomy and would also deliver affordability. it will cost roughly 25k so it is a 25k car musk said. it just won t have a steering wheel and pedals.

[TITLE_END] i just had hand surgery so i m writing this one handed but during my recovery i did nothing but look at tsla charts. i ve never been a big believer of technical analysis and i know some people ride and die for support levels but honestly i find it can be quite distracting and not very useful. in this case however we can notice a pattern of bag holders who have fomo d into something they ve wanted to sell for a quick buck and then had to bear the pain sometimes for years. a good deal of those sold at a loss at some point but tsla s market cap is still made up in some part of people in the red. these people have been waiting to cash in for years and at this point they re not gonna sell unless it at least hits a historic high. so i do believe that a price of $400 is at least for now an important support level for this stock and if i know the dude bro culture that is largely responsible of this rally i d actually say $420 is an ever more reasonable price within the next 2 months.

[TITLE_END] it is evident that many individuals face similar challenges in trading investing and options each with their own specific strategies and approaches. personally i have experienced significant success in investing achieving returns of over 100 on a few occasions though this was limited to four or five instances. conversely i have incurred losses exceeding $2 300 in minute trading with es futures spy minis. due to my struggles with futures trading i have decided to refrain from it as i found myself lacking the necessary patience. the financial stakes involved such as $12.50 per tick and $125 per handle were daunting and i felt that the micro contracts did not align with my trading style. i was inclined to treat the es as a gamble rather than a trade as the potential profit of $25 to $50 on significant moves did not seem worthwhile. currently i have recently ventured into options trading having started on october 2 2024. although my experience in this area is limited i am optimistic about my progress thus far. i recognize that this positive trend may not be sustainable but i remain hopeful. my journey in trading began in 2019 starting with a $300 course. if anyone has questions or requires assistance i am available to help. while i do not intend to share my specific trades i am more than willing to provide guidance to newcomers or anyone seeking answers.

2024-11-18,2024-11-18 05:22:41,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,trump team is seeking to ease us rules for self driving cars trump team is seeking to ease us rules for self driving cars [TITLE_END] tsla 5 overnight due to this news. members of president elect donald trump s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self driving vehicles one of the transportation department s priorities according to people familiar with the matter. if new rules enable cars without human controls that would directly benefit elon musk the tesla inc. chief executive officer and trump mega donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president elect s inner circle. he has bet the future of the ev maker on self driving technology and artificial intelligence. current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities which tesla plans to do. the trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self driving vehicles according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they weren t authorized to speak publicly. while the transportation department through the national highway traffic safety administration can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles an act of congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self driving cars. a bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around avs two of the people said. one candidate under consideration for transportation secretary is emil michael a former uber technologies inc. executive who has spoken with trump s team and potential staffers they said. the work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined they said. republican representatives sam graves of missouri and garret graves of louisiana have also been considered to lead the department the people said. the transition team didn t respond to requests for comment. musk in october announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. current us regulations pose significant hurdles to musk s plans for the so called cybercab including a cap limiting their deployment. he supported federal rules for autonomy on tesla s third quarter earnings call saying he d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. the pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of uber and rival lyft inc. trump has since named musk and entrepreneur vivek ramaswamy to lead a new department of government efficiency initiative to dismantle government bureaucracy and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome. past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled. nhtsa currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2 500 self driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100 000 have repeatedly failed. a bill to do that sailed through the house several years ago during trump s first term but the measure has been bogged down in the senate. an attempt during the first year of the biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class action cases.

2024-11-19,2024-11-19 21:04:07,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power multiples and enterprise value palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power multiples and enterprise value [TITLE_END] hello friends. i hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. this is a long analysis with a position at the end. i will discuss palantir and its recent explosion in share price as well as their current earnings multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. i recognize that this is r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone s risk profile. i hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir. so here s something you may have read somewhere palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy . since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. i m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o business segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. they showed strong revenue growth increasing margins and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. it is obviously a company that for the right price you want to be a part of. key phrase for the right price . i am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. but i would like to make a case for palantir being overvalued. in fact the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated palantir s stock is. for starters let s take into consideration palantir s enterprise value. despite the stock price rising roughly 50 versus its 2021 peak palantir s enterprise value has ballooned much more. 2021 peak enterprise value $60b at around $37 per share 17 11 2024 enterprise value $146b at around $64 per share this is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. in december 2020 palantir had 978m shares outstanding. this has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. while palantirs growth has certainly been impressive it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. their revenue per share metrics have been the following. end of 2020 $1.12 2021 $0.80 2022 $0.92 2 023 $1.04 ltm $1.19 palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue per share number that it had by the end of 2020. this is not necessarily a bad thing but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived growth stock. yes revenue is increasing but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. as a shareholder your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth. likewise their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. if it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture you better believe karp co will do so. many of palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non gaap numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag but one of the most overlooked aspects i found is that of interest income. palantir has a massive cash balance that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. this is of course nothing new lots of companies do this. but consider this. in their last blowout quarter palantir gained $0.06 of gaap eps. this amounts to roughly $150m of net income or about 1 1000th of their enterprise value. of this number $52m or more than one third was interest income. this is not a small footnote. only $100m of their last quarterly earnings was actual non adjusted no nonsense operating income. furthermore they also paid only $7.8m of taxes on their income. this number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. and then there is the valuation. palantir trades at 55x ev sales. this means that if all of palantir s revenue was after tax profits and paid out as dividends it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. their current ebit margin is a little over 13 . that 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require a incredible and sustained growth in revenue b a steadily increasing margin and c an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time we all remember stock mcnealy s iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble at 10 times revenues to give you a 10 year payback i have to pay you 100 of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. that assumes i can get that by my shareholders. that assumes i have zero cost of goods sold which is very hard for a computer company. that assumes zero expenses which is really hard with 39 000 employees. that assumes i pay no taxes which is very hard. and that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal. and that assumes with zero r d for the next 10 years i can maintain the current revenue run rate. now having done that would any of you like to buy my stock at $64 do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are you don t need any transparency. you don t need any footnotes. what were you thinking this is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. remember you still need upside it s not just about justifying the current stock price it s about penciling out enough upside in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. on friday the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. tesla bitcoin and palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. palantir added 11 and with this move added another five years of revenue to its elephant sized market cap. this shows pretty clearly that palantir is associated with meme like risk assets. who knows when the current market cap will reverse. it s a game of liquidity. musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. but one thing is clear their current ev ebitda is nearly 400x . the amount of retail shareholders i see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. my question is why based on what sure it shoots up 5 a day and this leads everyone to believe it s an amazing company. but long term this company has enormous shoes to fill. it is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. and unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40 annually for a decade and increase their margins to nvidia levels there is only one way this ride will end. as it stands now all of palantir s equity is in the $5b cash position that they gained through dilution. last quarter the company earned $0.06 of gaap eps of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. aside from the $2 of equity per share all of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. in the future growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1 3rd of gaap eps in interest income. their taxes will also go up in the future. if this is not a dotcom level valuation i do not know what is. if you currently buy a 10 year bond you will net roughly 4.5 in interest annually. palantirs stock nets you 1 8 in revenue all of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. thus i am short for now using graniteshares 3x palantir . the leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. thus i will look to acquire long dated puts this week. could get smoked some more but that s what makes a market. happy investing
2024-11-19,2024-11-19 23:08:46,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in pc chip sales by 2029 as company gets traction beyond smartphones qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in pc chip sales by 2029 as company gets traction beyond smartphones [TITLE_END] qualcomm said on tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029. of that amount roughly $4 billion will come from pc chips qualcomm said at its investor day on tuesday. the chipmaker just introduced pc processors earlier this year when it released snapdragon x for windows devices. the latest forecast marks an important milestone for qualcomm ceo cristiano amon who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. in fiscal 2024 qualcomm s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales about 75 of its entire chip business. qualcomm also said on tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175 by 2029 to $8 billion of which 80 is tied to contracts that have already been secured. we have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile amon said at the investor event. another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets a category qualcomm calls xr. about $4 billion of the forecast is a catch all for other chip sales like those for wireless headphones and tablets. qualcomm shares are up 16 this year trailing the nasdaq which has gained 26 . qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high end smartphones especially those running google android. qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to apple for its iphones. but the company has warned investors that apple could choose to stop buying qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. qualcomm said on tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from apple. qualcomm s strategy under amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips like modems processors and ai accelerators in new markets including cars pcs and virtual reality. the investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion. we put a strategy in 21 and we re not changing our strategy amon said. laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by intel which has over 70 percent of the market according to mercury research. intel reported $29 billion in pc chip sales in its 2023. the competitive landscape changed between the windows and macs amon said referring to apple s move in 2020 to switch from intel to its own processors. we saw that as an opportunity especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution. the forecast for xr headsets also hints at the growth potential of the vr market over the next five years. qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers including meta for its quest and ray bans products. when it comes to artificial intelligence qualcomm calls itself an edge ai company in contrast to cloud based ai that s typically powered by nvidia processors. company officials didn t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with cnbc. qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced ai that s restricted to large server farms today an indication that that company may benefit from the ai boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient. what you can run on the cloud last year you can run on the device this year durga malladi qualcomm s senior vice president in charge of planning said at the event. source

$6.6 billion loan from the u.s. department of energy [TITLE_END] rvine calif. november 26 2024 american all electric automaker rivian automotive today announced it has received conditional commitment from the u.s. department of energy s advanced technology vehicle manufacturing loan program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion to accelerate its growth and leadership of electric vehicle design development and manufacturing in the united states. if finalized the loan would support the construction of rivian s next facility in stanton springs north near the city of social circle georgia substantially expanding the company s domestic production capacity to support demand from the united states and international markets. this loan from doe would provide significant funding for production of the company s midsize platform which underpins the r2 a midsize suv and the r3 r3x a midsize crossover. designed engineered and built in america to deliver an incredible combination of capability function performance and pricing rivian believes its r2 and r3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company s long term growth and profitability. the doe loan would provide an important boost to the u.s. automotive industrial base enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the united states to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry. rivian intends to build the facility in two phases each resulting in 200 000 units of annual production capacity for a total of 400 000 units of annual capacity supporting the sale of american evs in international markets. phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. rivian is expected to create approximately 7 500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company s future manufacturing facility in georgia. this is in addition to 2 000 expected full time construction jobs that will utilize the region s significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic ev ecosystem. these jobs complement the thousands rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in normal illinois which have bolstered the local and regional economy. this loan will help create thousands of new american jobs and further strengthen u.s. leadership in ev manufacturing and technology said rivian founder and ceo rj scaringe. this loan would enable rivian to more aggressively scale our u.s. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced r2 and r3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability. a robust ecosystem of u.s. companies developing and manufacturing evs is critical for the u.s. to maintain its long term leadership in transportation. rivian plans to design and build a fully modern manufacturing facility at the stanton springs site less than one hour s drive from downtown atlanta employing modern construction techniques and advanced environmental management while preserving natural spaces and investing actively in the surrounding communities. over the history of the loan program doe has helped energize american ev manufacturing with billions in financing for this strategically important industry including loans to general motors and tesla. while this conditional commitment indicates doe s intent to finance the project doe and the company must satisfy certain technical legal environmental and financial conditions before the department of energy enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan. if finalized the loan would be secured by all

2024-11-27,2024-11-27 11:20:49,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,deep dive into kering from timber to gucci a legacy of acquisitions deep dive into kering from timber to gucci a legacy of acquisitions [TITLE_END] 1.0 introduction let s start with a fun fact. kering the company that owns brands like gucci yves saint laurent balenciaga bottega veneta and alexander mcqueen started as a timber trading company . although it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry its dna and management style haven t changed much. as i m writing this its share price is down over 70 from its peak back in august 2021 that was elevated due to the covid 19 pandemic. 2.0 the journey from timber to luxury 2.1 the timber period the company was founded in france by fran ois pinault back in 1962 with a 100 000 francs loan from the bank. the business grew rapidly by acquiring many failing local timber traders in france especially in the 1980s. by 1988 it owned 180 companies and 33 factories. 2.2 the switch from timber to retail to luxury in 1988 it was listed on the paris stock exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started it merged with cfao acquired conforama acquired printemps acquired 54 of la redoute acquired finac the transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42 of gucci group 100 of boucheron and 100 of yves saint laurent. today gucci accounts for 47 of its revenue. fran ois henri pinault the son of the founder fran ois pinault became general manager of the company in 2003 and ceo in 2005. under his leadership the acquisitions in the luxury space continued. it is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions . its portfolio is quite diversified and includes high end clothing footwear handbags and leather goods sunglasses and eyewear scarves other fashion accessories jewelry fragrances cosmetics watches it is also geographically diversified apac 32 of revenue western europe 28 of revenue north america 23 of revenue japan 8 of revenue rest of the world 9 of revenue 3.0 historical financial performance its revenue increased from 15.9 billion in 2019 to 20.4 billion in 2022 and has contracted back to 18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. kering s gross margin is stable at 75 meaning the direct costs are well controlled. however its operating margin is down below 20 . the explanation is simple. reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job. when there s less traffic in the physical stores the operating expenses remain the same. the company still needs to pay the lease payment its employees the utility bills etc. in fact these expenses grow over time as there s the impact of inflation. scaling down by closing locations is also not a free option. not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location. the company is generating substantial cash flows but i ll argue the capital allocation is poor. all numbers in m cash 1.837 operating cash flow 21.541 capex acquisitions debt 4.887 share buyback dividends other 25 cash 3.696 between 2019 and h1 2024 the company generated over 21.5 billion in operating cash flow or a bit less than 14 billion after capex. close to 60 of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends and an additional 15 through share buybacks. what s left of the free cash flow together with additional debt was used for acquisitions. why do i think the capital allocation is poor two main reasons 1. almost 80 of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022 the years when the share price was the highest . a good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares. 2. its net debt position more than doubled from 7.1 billion in 2019 to 15.4 billion as of june 30th 2024. this is equal to 60 of its market cap. the interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75 to 5 and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate it could significantly reduce its profit margins. 4.0 what can be expected based on the latest investor presentation there are three capital allocation priorities organic growth shareholder return and fuel high potential adjacent businesses. all of it while having a healthy financial situation and fcf generation. this is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. i find this slide a bit odd for three reasons 1. on one side they want to return capital to the shareholders which would position them as a company with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends . on the other side its history is full of acquisitions which is the opposite of preserving capital. 2. the center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and fcf generation while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years . 3. innovation is not a focus at all. roughly 2 months ago essilorluxottica and meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. i see a lot of potential in this area that isn t utilized . growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the dna of the company and likely what one should expect going forward. 5.0 dividends the dividend per share has been steadily increasing from 4 back in 2015 to 14 in 2024. the current dividend yield is 6 . if the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option. 6.0 high employee turnover at the end of 2023 the company had 48 964 employees. during the year there were 13 403 new hires and 11 275 employees departed. at first glance this is no doubt a high turnover. this sounds bad at first but it is really difficult to decipher. in theory any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees during peak seasons. therefore the increase and subsequently decrease of employees is normal. this is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive . in addition 59 of the employees are gen y a generation that is known for seeking career growth which could lead to more job hopping than average. given the reviews on indeed glassdoor and comparably there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue. 7.0 the concerns 7.1 balenciaga advertising scandal back in 2022 balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. one of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage inspired outfits. this was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate. this brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing. in addition given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands scandals of this kind could have a significant impact. 7.2 preliminary investigation by the european commission in april 2023 the european commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. one of the inspections took place at the italian premises of gucci. an investigation of this kind does not imply guilt but if a company is found in breach of eu antitrust rules there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros. the investigation is still ongoing and no conclusions have been reached. 8.0 valuation this is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. therefore here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing kering revenue the industry is cyclical in nature so there will be good and bad times. based on the past i do not feel confident that kering can take market share so i expect its growth to normalize at 3 per year which is in line with the inflation rate. operating margin the luxury market is getting more crowded and as argued earlier reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. once the demand is somewhat stable i expect the operating margin to increase to 21 . based on those assumptions the fair value of the company is 27 billion which is very close to the current price of 224 share . this offers an irr of 9 which is slightly below the historical return of the s p500. 8.1 the bull case those who are betting on kering are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following revitalization of balenciaga rebuilding its reputation after the controversies sustained growth in gucci and expansion of secondary brands like bottega veneta saint laurent the success of its newly launched beauty division capturing market share from rivals like lvmh and estee lauder positive macro tailwinds utilizing pricing power integration of recent acquisitions reducing operating costs if the management can pull this off then the value per share could be 2x from today s share price. 8.2 the bear case those who are betting against kering are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following brand mismanagement more scandals inability to revitalize balenciaga inability to innovate around its primary brands failure to integrate its acquisitions further poor m a acquisitions negative macro tailwinds inability to innovate around e commerce supply chain issues competitive pressure increase in corporate tax by the french authorities in this scenario the fair value per share could be below 100 share. i hope you enjoyed this post feel free to share your thoughts.

2024-11-29,2024-11-29 00:44:37,TSLA,Tesla,investing,talking with my dad about nvidia over thanksgiving talking with my dad about nvidia over thanksgiving [TITLE_END] my dad is an active investor has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. yesterday we were talking about nvidia and in our conversation there was something about ai and nvidia and that he didn t know that i thought was common knowledge but i m curious how common it actually is or if it s a generational gap. the knowledge that i thought was common was that the biggest reason nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on ai is that graphics algorithms and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation large matrix multiplication. they have spent decades developing gpus for graphics processing other stuff but through no effort on their own the other stuff is now more valuable than the graphics processing. their ai hardware is really just the most recent version of their gpus that they sold to consumers to pixar etc. not similar they are literally the same thing. they didn t somehow develop ai hardware in the past 2 years that s better than everybody else s they ve been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the ai use case. this is also why it s so hard for a competitor to overtake them they have a lot of ground to catch up on. hardware development is really slow really expensive and really difficult. this came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex nvidia current tesla engineer saying something about how tesla had hardware that was years ahead of nvidia which is not really even remotely likely imho. google has spent almost 10 years developing its tpus for machine learning specifically and even then they re only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally. as to why nvidia and not amd it s largely because of their software stack and community support. they have put a lot of effort into developing cuda cudnn etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10 years ago so now it s what everybody builds on. before all the arm chair experts come out of the woodwork yes i know that gpus are general purpose parallel processing units but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. and i know that they ve been tailoring recent generations of gpus more towards ml use cases and they re not exactly like gpus of old. and yes i know that their data center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards. i don t mean to discount their good work they ve done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck. tl dr the energy it takes to train chatgpt could fry 100 000 turkeys this year

2024-12-02,2024-12-02 11:37:34,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",pennystocks,research and detailed analysis on high tide inc $hiti research and detailed analysis on high tide inc $hiti [TITLE_END] background how became the leading cannabis retailer in canada the beginning raj grover the founder and ceo who owns 9 of the company and has never sold a single share comes from an entrepreneurial family and had already experienced success with several smaller businesses before establishing during a business trip to india in search of opportunities in fashion accessories or body jewelry raj stumbled upon the potential of cannabis consumption accessories. recognizing the margin arbitrage opportunity he shipped $10 000 worth of consumption accessories from new delhi to canada and sold everything overnight. after replicating this success a few more times raj decided to open a store. this marked the beginning of high tide s story . in 2009 raj opened smokers corner with an initial investment of less than $50 000 and grew it into a multimillion dollar empire. at that time there were only two or three competitors with unappealing stores. raj believed that by creating a differentiated store in a smart location he could easily capture market share and he was right. by leveraging his established roots in indonesia thailand china and india he was able to not only provide a better customer experience but also offer much cheaper products. cannabis legalization in canada always looking to stay ahead raj seized the opportunity when the prime minister of canada announced that recreational cannabis would soon be legalized. with an existing customer base of cannabis users it made perfect sense for raj to expand into selling cannabis itself. he realized that if he only sold accessories he would eventually lose customers to shops that offered both cannabis and accessories. after nine years of focusing on consumption accessories and accumulating nearly $10m in retained earnings raj raised $88.5m for the first time in 2018 and ventured into the equity markets marking the beginning of high tide s journey as a publicly traded company . with easier access to capital when compared to its peers high tide expanded its footprint across canada highlighted by the significant acquisition of its competitor meta in 2020 which increased the number of stores from 37 to 67. the strategy shift that made everything change around the same time with higher margin profiles a pivotal decision for the company . from acquiring several brands in the u.s. such as smoke cartel fabcbd daily high club dankstop and nuleaf holdings to later acquiring blessedcbd in the uk high tide leveraged its market power to enhance margins and diversify its revenue streams. in the summer of 2021 was accepted for listing on the nasdaq marking a significant milestone. later that year a transformative decision was made high tide launched a discount club model for its retail stores in october 2021 . with consolidated margins higher than any competitor due to the previously mentioned cbd related acquisitions high tide could offer cannabis at remarkably low prices attracting loyal members and rapidly gaining market share . although this discount model initially involved selling cannabis at a loss the move proved to be incredibly successful . high tide s market share increased from less than 4 to over 10 in less than three years despite representing less than 5 of the total cannabis retail store count. today the discount model program has more than 1.5m members and continues to grow each quarter . being the first of its kind discount model was the key differentiating factor that propelled high tide to become the leading cannabis retailer in canada. no competitor could match their prices and raj targeted cannabis users who consumed regularly and were highly price sensitive. when i first started investing in high tide one of its closest competitors was fire flower holdings which ultimately went bankrupt following this price war. there are many more examples of competitors that went bankrupt following this showing how strong has become in the sector. and the consolidation of the market in canada is just starting. this strategy also significantly diminished the illicit market further strengthening high tide s market share. after capturing market share it was time to turn profitable while raj sacrificed margins to achieve this economies of scale and several initiatives aimed at improving margins allowed as well as positive net income in the most recent quarterly results with a consolidated leadership position stronger than ever. overall high tide took a calculated risk to become the leader in the country and it proved to be incredibly successful. this success was only possible due to the ceo s extensive experience in the sector and deep understanding of the cannabis consumer surpassing that of any other management team. what s next for the best is yet to come. while the focus on becoming fcf led to a notable deceleration in revenue growth is now returning to its high growth strategy . despite cannabis being legal for over five years there s still significant market potential to capture in canada. a recent regulatory change in ontario now allows one company to operate up to 150 recreational cannabis stores doubling the previous cap of 75. this change is benefiting large retail chains like capitalizing on the opportunity and targeting the high presence of the illicit market in the region. moreover the canadian market is experiencing significant consolidation allowing high tide to expand its market share organically and through acquisitions at depressed multiples. for example high tide recently acquired a store for 1.5x last quarter s annualized adj. ebitda. the ceo mentioned in the last earnings call that he s in negotiations with a sizable player to acquire additional stores aiming to accelerate its footprint expansion and surpass this year s initial target. every month there are dozens of cannabis stores closing in canada because they simply can t compete with over the next two years high tide is expected to reach a 15 market share up from 12 today. it s worth mentioning that raj and his team have always been methodical in selecting store locations ensuring each one yields significant returns which is why the annual revenue per store at surpasses the industry average by a wide margin. over the next three to five years there s potential to reach an annual revenue of $1b in canada alone . is one of the very few cannabis companies that does not depend on any new legislation to keep growing and improving its bottom line numbers. ongoing developments in the u.s. might give the green light to expand there. high tide with its vast e commerce base of over 3m u.s. customers and profitable operations is poised to leverage these developments. raj grover s strategic approach as a second mover allows him to avoid pitfalls and strategically open stores in key states. the company is ready to capitalize on its strong foundation and scale efficiently aiming to secure significant market share with well chosen locations and a clear expansion strategy. most u.s. operators struggle to turn a profit even with gross margins in the 40 50 range while is both fcf and net income profitable with a gross margin below 30 . while the company doesn t depend on the u.s. market to continue growing this presents an additional catalyst for its upcoming growth trajectory. regardless of whether this expansion happens quickly or not these developments will attract a wave of new investors to the sector and contribute to an overall expansion in multiples. high tide is becoming the costco of cannabis after the success of its free discount model which gathered over 1.5m members in under three years launched elite a paid membership with even better offers . the rollout began slowly but membership is now growing at a record pace 226 yoy and 38 qoq last quarter. it s worth noting that this growth is happening while the subscription price is being raised. although the absolute number is still relatively small at 46 000 the conversion rate of regular club members to elite ones is getting better every quarter. you only need to make a small purchase for the membership price to pay for itself it s exactly like the long term vision is for high tide to be the of cannabis driving strong and predictable cash flows and strengthening high tide s competitive edge . i believe this is one of the catalysts that will help further improve bottom line margins. despite being a retailer with relatively low margins have room to grow . cannabis prices in canada are just starting to stabilize and is waiting for full market stabilization before aggressively launching white labels. while many independents are closing and the market is consolidating isn t raising prices yet to avoid aiding competitors. the long term strategy is to leverage pricing power gradually . when i asked the ceo if fcf margins are nearing a peak the response was clear no there are still many growth opportunities . as the market consolidates and market share increases they anticipate further improvements in both gross and fcf margins plus new areas to explore with scale and other initiatives. valuation is the most superior cannabis business yet the cheapest. retail investors in canada alone have lost over $130b since the 2017 bubble popped so i understand why everyone is wary of this sector. but i have demonstrated how is different from the most well known cannabis companies like and others. high tide generates strong fcf and has a track record of consistently impressive execution . most importantly it has a highly aligned management team that cares about shareholders which is rare in the sector. the fact that this sector is at its peak of pessimism is what makes it possible for us to buy at such a cheap valuation. it s also worth mentioning that unlike the other names mentioned high tide went public late in the game and was not part of the bubble in 2017 2018. that s why it is so underfollowed and why most people don t even know about it.let s check the numbers. generated cad $22.7m in fcf over the last 12 months so it is currently trading at 10x ltm fcf. it s worth noting that this was the first full year of fcf profitability so this number should improve further from here. is the best performing retail cannabis company and one of the very few that is already generating both fcf and net income yet it remains the cheapest . faster growth better margins a superior management team a winning business model the lowest valuation a complete bargain at least in my view. while most investors are avoiding this sector due to the well known companies that destroy shareholder value i m taking advantage of this opportunity by investing in what i consider a hidden gem. before finishing i d like to highlight this has less than 10 institutional ownership while over 75 of the market is owned by institutions. peter lynch often talks about this . if you want to achieve multibagger returns find a hidden gem before the institutions do. for greater understanding look at the company presentation since images are not allowed in the presentation they better

2024-12-08,2024-12-08 13:47:50,TSLA,Tesla,investing,i m bullish on rivian and here is why. i m bullish on rivian and here is why. [TITLE_END] currently holding 65 shares looking to round that out to 100 next pay period. i am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. i am simply sharing my thoughts. these are the things i will be watching this year to continue to add to my position or to see if i should reconsider my bullish sentiment. 1. nearing profitability. rivian has recently re affirmed that by q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. they are expected to deliver just over 50 000 vehicles for the year. that is a combination of mostly r1s and r1t with some of the amazon delivery vans. if there guidance is correct and they either meet or beat q4 24 earnings it is a bullish sign. 2. $6 billion loan from uncle sam. now the new administration does create a bit of tension here. the new doge agency is going to be cutting gov. spending across the board. there is some concern they will take away this loan that the biden administration had given to rivian. while this is certainly a possibility i do not think it is going to happen. i think it would be a very bad look politically and would give strength to the argument musk will us his gov. connections to attack his competitors. because of that i think this money is safely staying with rivian. if it turns out doge is going to back down from this threat that is another bullish sign. 3. vw rivian joint venture. vw na is about to change they are getting a new ceo kjell gruner who previously was the president and ceo of porsche cars of north america and then moved to rivian to be there chief commercial officer president business growth . vw desperatley needs software expertise and rivian delivers that in spades. that combined with vws massive buying and production power is a strong match. this is a bullish sign right now and what i think has been pushing to stock upwards. vw has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits. the introduction of the old new scout brand that looks mighty similar to rivians r2 concepts. as well as confirming the deal with rivian it looks like they re finally going to start to take serious steps to rebuilding their reputation especially in na. 4. rivians customers are happy and according to a recent consumer reports survey 86 of owners say they would buy a rivian again better than tesla. if they are happy with their purchase they will talk to their other wealthy friends about their rivian word of mouth is very powerful. 5. the inevitable tesla comparison. rivian is not tesla. now obviously tesla the company in 2024 is very different to tesla the company in 2015. back in 2015 it was the 3rd year of model s production and the first of model x. in 2015 tesla sold just over 50 000 model s. now in 2023 just two years after the rivian r1t debuted rivian sold just over 47 000 vehicles. i think tesla in 2015 is more of a fair comparison to rivian now in 2024 but tesla now in 2024 is not so comparable to rivian now in 2024. i think rivian makes a fantastic product and there s a bright future ahead for them.
2024-12-08,2024-12-08 16:07:19,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,shorting tesla shorting tesla [TITLE_END] tesla went up almost 50 after trump won elections. although they are friends trump might revoke the ev tax credits. and if not tesla will most likely be excluded from california s ev tax credits which is the inspiration for 12 other states that may or may not follow california s example. further tesla is becoming less of an exclusive brand and revenue is mainly from more discounted cars. of course tesla is more than just the cars but it is their core business.. do you think lower revenue might tank the stock or will it still be interesting due to the different other businesses or that elon musk as a ceo is already enough to keep investors in.

2024-12-09,2024-12-09 16:46:43,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,qubt is about to crash hard qubt is about to crash hard [TITLE_END] context quantum computing is having its moment. it s risky but could massively disrupt industries in areas like computing finance and cyber security. but stock market bubbles are forming. quantum computing is probably the most technically difficult industry for analysts to assess. few people are equipped with an adequate understanding of quantum technologies which is leading to massive mispricing. qubt is junk quantum computing inc. has many problems. iceberg research s recent short report covers some of them. they note that the firm has run from one fad to another and failed at each. they list several misleading claims that qubt has made and withdrawn. the report is damning and raises serious questions about the future of the company i encourage you all to read it. however iceberg does not go far enough. qubt lacks talent. successful quantum innovations requires strong technical knowledge that you really can only come by in either leading universities or megacap firms like google. i went through the linkedin profiles of each of qubt s employees and compared them with their small cap competitors. i tallied up the share of employees that went to an edu rank top 100 world universities for quantum physics qubt ranks incredibly poorly among it s peers less than a fifth of employees . this is robust to different ranking metrics. counting only ivy leagues qubt comes out much worse. but look not all employees are on linkedin. maybe qubt is the next big underdog no. a large share of qubt s talent comes from the steven s institute of technology an unremarkable university in new jersey the company s chief quantum officer is yuping huang. on first glance he appears to have a prolific publishing history however most papers receive low citations and or he is third fourth or fifth author. huang was previously sued by shareholders for breaching fiduciary duties when he merged his previous company qphoton with qubt. notably he is both a qubt director and employee which is a big corporate governance redflag . there is only one independent director with a background in quantum physics to provide checks and balance on huang dr javad shabani. he is not up to the task. his publishing history is mediocre. looking deeper the chief technology officer yong meng sua has an even more mediocre publishing history. and has only risen to an assistant professor role at steven s. he spends much of his time discussing esoteric computing questions tangential to his work and finally the director of the company s chip foundry . dr milan begliarbekov after finishing high school enrolled in a bachelor s degree in english literature at steven s graduated then immediately enrolled in a physics phd at steven s. either he is a savant polymath who is able to pick up grad school physics level math or a phd from steven s is worthless. his publishing career is very mediocre. these scientists will not crack the major problems stopping widespread commercialization of quantum tech. simply compare their publishing records to the founder at ion q or leading quantum scientists at google alongside the significant and verifiable technological advancements these companies have made. another clue that something is amiss is headcount. rigetti has three fold the number of employees as qubt. qbts has six fold. all have similar market cap. what s driving value we ve established that it s not human capital. iceberg s research reveals it s not intellectual property or physical capital either. so why has it done so well qubt s high valuation is driven by regarded retail investors. only 3.3 of qubt is held by institutional investors . compared with 40 for ionq 30 for rgti and 47 for qbts. the lack of institutional investment in qubt while institutional investors are simultaneously clamouring to load up on quantum stocks is a massive red flag that something is up with qubt. in fact no wall street analysts track qubt. so what happens next qubt s 800 rise in one month is going to attract short selling interest as people realise it s junk. the stock will fall back below $1. risk if you want to short buy puts you can rest assured that the company is not going to suddenly become profitable. the main risk comes from why qubt has done so well despite having little revenue expertise or innovation to show for it. qubt is literally called quantum computing incorporated. if you re a full regard wanting to invest in quantum computing are you going to invest in ionq rigetti or a company conveniently called quantum computing it s a regard trap. it s like being interested in electric cars and passing on tesla because you wanted to invest in a stock called electric car co. my positions 1000 put contracts to sell $4.50 cost average 0.11 expiring dec 20. if this doesn t work i m going to buy puts again and again. this company sucks. i m long ionq and after doing this dd i will probably also buy rigetti in the near future. $sava

2024-12-10,2024-12-10 08:46:46,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,uber vs everyone uber vs everyone [TITLE_END] alright unless you been living under a rock you heard or seen some videos of self driving vehicles be it waymo or tesla. the future of self driving vehicles is not a question of if at this point but when . my question to you is this how do you see uber play out in this changing fat environment. in your view do you see uber benefiting or losing from the rise of av brought in by smaller and bigger companies. here is my take and i m also not fully clear . uber clearly wants to be a software company the biggest aggregator of all mobility needs. they spent like crazy to be number 1 in travel. they spent like crazy during covid to be the number 1 food delivery service. they spending like crazy on grocery delivery from what i notice and they eye to grow their freight business. all their investments and actions points towards the aggregator strategy from offloading their own self driving decision to aurora to investing in all kinds of different startup from serv robotics to aurora and companies in india asia and latin america. can this strategy back fire it could however let s ask what does google want google up until this point was mainly a software company yes they produce their own pixel phones but i believe their main competitor is not uber but tesla. google might be expanding their taxi service but is the end goal for them to be a global taxi company i think not. there is much more profit in expanding the waymo service up until they prove that their software reached maturity. at that point google will lease that software to any car manufacturer for a price growing revenue in speeds that they won t be able to match staying exclusive hence the tesla competitor. in the scenario that they lease sell their software to any car manufacturer it won t be the end of the road for uber because at worst case they can purchase a fleet of cars to continue their operations and supplement their other av partners. now let s assume waymo stays exclusive and google interested to be a taxi company meaning their partnership with uber will end and they essentially going to compete with uber. in this case uber investments in aurora innovation might come helpful they can re acquire aurora and their tech for whatever it s worth and build on top of it. they can use their large cash flow to acquire a smaller av company that struggles to compete with the big players and build on it. in both scenarios uber has a way out as long as they don t lay on their stomach blinded by short term profits and make sure to pivot at the right moment . this is how i see it i will be happy for anyone to challenge this view because sometime we all get blinded by our own biases.

2024-12-10,2024-12-10 21:31:24,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",wallstreetbets,unity technologies unity technologies [TITLE_END] unity software inc. is a technology company that specializes in developing and operating a platform for creating real time 3d content and experiences. unity is primarily known for its game engine and development tools which allow creators to build run and monetize interactive 2d and 3d content across various platforms. their engine and development tools is used in wide range of industries including video game development architecture and design automotive film and animation and virtual and augmented reality. they are a duopoly in the game engine market with epic games . unity holds approximately 40 50 of the game engine market share while unreal engine accounts for 10 20 . as of 2023 over 70 of the top mobile games globally were developed using unity s platform. in 2024 mobile gaming is expected to generate approximately $92.6 billion in revenue compared to $51.9 billion for console gaming and $40 billion for pc gaming. as of 2024 a significant portion of vr apps in the apple store are likely created using unity with estimates suggesting that over 60 of ar vr content across platforms is made with unity. unity s stock have been doing poorly ever since the great 2022 bear market the john riccitiello fee incident and the dreadful ironsource purchase under his tenure. they have since fired him in 2023 and appointed matthew bromberg as unity s new chief executive officer president and a member of the unity board of directors effective may 15 2024. bromberg has since replaced all the c suites with competent people. they did a reset on their portfolio to put their focus on their core business which they refer to as their strategic portfolio the engine cloud and monetization. the strategic portfolio consists of two main segments create solutions this segment encompasses unity s game development platform and tools. in q3 2024 create solutions revenue grew 5 year over year driven by subscription growth. the create segment includes 1. unity game engine and development tools 2. unity 6 the latest version of the engine with over 500 000 downloads 3. expansion into non gaming industries which grew 59 year over year and represents 18 of create revenue grow solutions this segment includes advertising and monetization tools. in q3 2024 grow solutions revenue declined by 5 . it focuses on 1. advertising technology 2. monetization services for game developers 3. development of a new advertising model set to launch in 2025 let s talk about the mobile gaming monetization and advertising space and their competitor applovin . applovin wanted to buy unity for $20b back in 2022 to form a monopoly but got rejected. unity has since failed to keep up with applovin who is now the third largest mobile gaming in app advertising network after google and meta. unity ironsource platform just can t compete with applovin s superior algos and platform but things are about to change because the new ceo hired jim payne to join the company as chief product officer for advertising effective august 12 2024. payne co founded mopub the world s largest mobile in app ad server and exchange and max advertising systems a mobile header bidding platform . in their latest earning s call bromberg said they have a new machine learning model in their new neural network that is being tested on their live data that will be ready to launch when it s ready . app s current mcap is $111b while unity is at $10.78b if their new ml model is competitive the stock can easily 5x from here just from the grow solutions business . this is why some people are looking to short applovin and long unity. on the create solution side unity recently announced on oct 30 2024 they hired ex king cto and havok co founder steve collins as cto which will add key technical leadership to accelerate product innovation quality and stability. in 2023 havok products were used in twelve of the top twenty best selling video games in the united states. here are a you probably heard of that used havok physics dark souls 1 3 bloodborne bioshock series cs go half life 2 the last of us halo 2 3 the legend of zelda breath of the wild the legend of zelda tears of the kingdom now let s talk about war unity s engine and development tools is also used by the dod the department of defense primarily uses the unity engine to create realistic immersive virtual training simulations for military personnel allowing them to practice complex scenarios in a safe and controlled environment across various domains like combat tactics vehicle operation war simulations and situational awareness all within a 3d digital world. unity technologies corporation has been awarded two significant contracts related to the u.s. department of defense multiple award indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract. this contract has a maximum value of $12 billion and will provide a broad range of it related services to the entire dod for up to 12 years. caci contract unity signed a multi million dollar contract with enterprise technology firm caci to become the preferred real time 3d platform for u.s. government defense projects. i don t think even the palantards know this offering is built with unity s 3d engine. now let s rewind it back to 2015 when access to the platform. one of the possible reasons the acquisition fell through is antitrust concerns because meta would be a monopoly in vr ar if they own unity. i believe the future is xr and that xr will be next major computing platform after mobile. i believe meta will become the largest company in the world within the next 10 20 years which is why i m highly optimistic about unity given its significant role in the xr ecosystem. this is a long term investment for generational wealth. this post is made for posterity. positions

2024-12-12,2024-12-12 18:51:03,TSLA,Tesla,investing,returning to active stock portfolio management returning to active stock portfolio management [TITLE_END] i recently decided to return to active stock portfolio management after my first attempt ended somewhat disastrously. to reconcile this experience and entertain others i want to reflect on the mistakes i made and the new approaches i ve adopted. but first briefly the story of my initial failure. when i started managing my portfolio i quickly learned about the s p 500 but was convinced i was smart enough to outperform the market. arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall. in 2019 i flirted with bitcoin which initially delivered great returns. encouraged by the hype i also invested heavily in paysafe shortly after its ipo believing in its potential because everyone said it was going to be great. at the same time i was doing a lot of day trading. looking back i realize i wasn t trading rationally. i d look at graphs and invest simply because i felt the price would go up. i was taking desirable outcomes for granted. although i made a few conservative and reasonable investments their success couldn t offset the losses caused by bitcoin s decline paysafe s terrible performance and my risky trading. after 18 months my portfolio was down 40 . the arrogance i started with made the loss feel devastating. i abandoned my investment account for several years. when i returned to it a year ago i discovered that the growth of my conservative investments along with bitcoin s recovery had boosted my portfolio to 20 growth from my initial investment. i sold everything and bought into the s p 500 feeling that i wasn t capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund. this turned out to be a good action as the s p 500 performed very well this year. now i feel i ve learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again. to avoid repeating the same mistakes i ve set specific rules to guide me 1. i avoid speculative investments i now steer clear of speculative assets like crypto ipo stocks or companies like tesla. i want to be a disciplined investor keeping my greed under control. 2. i reject market timing i no longer believe in timing the market but instead focus on time in the market. i avoid trying to buy low today and sell high tomorrow because it s too easy to confuse wishful thinking with reality. paying attention to micro events can help to take advantage of daily fluctuations but it requires too much time and still offers uncertain outcomes. more often than not it doesn t pay off. 3. focus on debt to equity in the past i ignored the debt to equity ratio. now i prioritize companies with consistent net income and manageable debt levels. 4. limit individual stock exposure i cap my individual stock picks at 5 of my total portfolio. previously this rule would have forced me to find 20 or more stocks to invest in leading to choosing assets that were just okay rather than ones i genuinely liked. thankfully with most of my portfolio now in the s p 500 individual stock picks act as a good supplement rather than a replacement for the index. 5. invest in goods and services i value my approach to stock selection has shifted. i now look for companies whose products and services i personally interact with and consider them of great value. if the companies also demonstrate strong financial performance and maintain a reasonable debt to equity ratio they become my choice. i hope these rules will help me sleep well at night keep me from obsessing over financial news and generate decent returns that complement the s p 500.

you would like me to check out i have found a lot of solid picks from past commenters cheers blockmate ventures inc. $mate.v $matef market cap $13m company overview blockmate is a blockchain focused company with its main asset being hivello. hivello is a decentralized platform where users can share their computing resources for things like ai modelling storage and vpn services. in return they get paid in tokens. blockmate owns more than 50 of hivello and is targeting growth in regions like africa and asia where this kind of income could really take off. highlights right now the big story with blockmate is hivello. the platform makes it easy for people to earn passive income anywhere from $20 to $300 a month by running nodes. for users in developing countries this extra money could go a long way and the potential to scale quickly in these markets is a huge opportunity. hivello recently raised $3.5m at a $30m usd valuation. blockmate s stake alone is worth over $0.20 cad per share which is double the stock s current price . once the financing closes it could bring even more attention to the company. the hivello token launch planned for q1 2025 is another big catalyst. if the token takes off it could create a cycle where more users join the token value rises and the platform gains even more traction. early beta testing has been looking promising and the company plans to grow the user base quickly with partnerships and rental programs for people who don t already own equipment. financially blockmate is in a good spot. recent warrant exercises added to their cash reserves and the company is keeping its operations lean. domenic carosa the president owns 20m shares so he s clearly invested in the company s success. i just like this play because obviously crypto is hot right now and of all the different narratives and use cases for blockchain tech depin is one of the most promising imo. zoomd technologies ltd. $zmdtf $zomd.v market cap 74m company overview

2024-12-15,2024-12-15 02:56:17,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",wallstreetbets,leaps golden cross death cross strategy question leaps golden cross death cross strategy question [TITLE_END] i have an idea for a strategy that requires quite a bit of time to do. i m not sure if this is already a strategy so my bad if it is. it s self explanatory but waiting for a golden cross and buying a leaps. i was basically wondering what are some issues with this strategy if anyone s tried something similar apart from the obvious like the lagging affect because it s an average indicator that s obvious and is a very glaring issue but has anyone tried this strategy and found ways to get around the lag or is this strategy just not viable if not paired with other indicators ta the reason i thought about this was growth stocks like meta apple google and most recently costco had golden crosses and have gone up so high. costcos last golden cross was at like $887 or so and it s now trading at $980 to $1000. obviously the longer you let a leaps run solely based off an average indicator the more risk your taking on cause it could very well cause a late exit and loss in profit. but what about doing maybe a month of price movement and exiting would a golden cross leaps strategy not be viable why or why not i d love to hear everyone s thoughts

2024-12-16,2024-12-16 09:23:04,TSLA,Tesla,wallstreetbets,tesla bull and bear case the great ai and liability gamble tesla bull and bear case the great ai and liability gamble [TITLE_END] tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently nearly doubling to $1.4t market cap in just three months. the catalyst is trump s victory and elon musk s instrumental role in it. investors expect elon s influence to relax regulations clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout a potential game changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole. tesla is trading like an ai startup and for good reason its full self driving system is at the heart of the valuation. but investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look. the bull case tesla s data volume tesla has a massive data advantage. with over 4 million vehicles on the road each equipped with a suite of cameras tesla s fleet constantly collects real world driving data. this data acts as a shadow trainer for its ai gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. meanwhile fsd subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the ai providing tesla with even more labeled data. behind the scenes tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases rare and tricky driving scenarios. tesla combines supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its ai. more importantly tesla s massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume which usually means better machine learning.on top of this tesla s vision only approach using cameras without lidar makes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. the result a system that could be deployed anywhere in the world not just pre mapped areas. the bear case quantity vs. quality more data is not always better and it s possible that tesla might reach a plateau. teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments where edge cases are relatively rare while waymo trains their ai in dense chaotic urban areas. the result is a more diverse dataset that s constantly evolving. waymo is owned by alphabet and has been operating fully autonomous l4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. it uses both cameras and lidar. combining 2d and 3d data in this way is something tesla initially set out but failed to do. elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of since it often conflicted with the vision data. but waymo has somehow managed to make it work. this means that its data is much richer in quality. the urban focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than tesla s suburban heavy dataset giving its ai a potentially richer training environment. the geofencing that tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for waymo. by limiting its operations to pre mapped areas waymo minimizes liability and achieves level 4 autonomy with real world deployments today. tesla by comparison is still at level 2 which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. moving from l2 to l4 isn t just an incremental step it s an order of magnitude leap in complexity. tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. waymo trains its ai in the most chaotic environments places like san francisco and new york city. tesla s fsd by contrast collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. cities provide more edge cases such as jaywalking pedestrians aggressive lane merges and unexpected construction detours. as the saying goes if you can make it here you can make it anywhere. if waymo s ai can survive the chaos of manhattan or downtown la it s far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. in contrast tesla s suburban data might create a same shit different day scenario where the ai becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare high stakes scenarios. regulatory relaxation is a double edged sword if musk succeeds in relaxing regulations tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. in theory this could limit tesla s liability especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. however accidents involving unsuspecting third parties remain a significant risk. under current frameworks manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles meaning tesla could face infinite exposure even for a small number of accidents. even if musk changes the regulatory framework courts ultimately determine liability and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best complicity at worst. tesla s data suggests fsd already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics which is very impressive. however publishing accident rates also acknowledges that fsd causes accidents. they currently get away with it because again l2 puts the onus on the driver. but it s a different story if they deploy robotaxis as l3 or l4. in that case any accident caused by fsd is the onus of tesla exposing them to unlimited liability. the scalability myth tesla bulls often criticize waymo s reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable but this argument doesn t hold weight for two reasons. first lidar is becoming much cheaper and with volume production costs could approach tesla s camera only system. ironically elon s first principles philosophy should be applied here just because something was a certain way before doesn t mean it has to be that way. secondly the market for taxis in general is urban. when was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed giving it a more focused path to profitability. tesla vs. waymo is really tesla vs. google waymo uses millions of ai generated simulations to train its system. it s ai teaching ai similar to how alphago and alphazero were trained. tesla may also use simulations but waymo s superior compute power means it s clearly dominant in this regard. tesla bulls often cite elon s dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of tesla s superior approach. but they overlook google s hegemony in ai. they were in the game before anyone. they delivered alphago alphafold and many other paradigm shifting world changing products backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. tesla s dojo may be promising but it s still a newbie. tl dr tesla s $1.4t valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving which is to say its lead in ai. if tesla dominates ai the stock might still be undervalued. but the data quantity vs. data quality liability risks and waymo s technical advantages suggest tesla may be actually falling behind. in which case it s vastly overvalued.

2024-12-16,2024-12-16 15:08:16,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",investing,2.5 year follow up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks 2.5 year follow up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks [TITLE_END] i bought the dip on several pandemic stocks that had significant declines in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1 2 times a year. in q3 2023 i began reallocating into ai related stocks when i developed strong conviction. i m also working on a self funded ai startup which keeps me in the loop on ai. returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. there s more context in my previous updates linked below. previous updates progress updates below are the returns for this portfolio as of december 2024. realized in 2023 affirm 18.09 allbirds 6.89 coinbase 6.42 carvana 845.57 meta 256.36 cloudflare 50.67 netflix 122.39 peloton 71.51 roblox 25.57 shopify 51.27 snapchat 1.99 unity 27.57

42.66 shopify 86.96 snowflake 51.57 super micro computer 14.48 taiwan semiconductor 103.19 tesla 92.16 unity 8.73 short term capital gain loss held for 1yr i held several companies for a short time to spread out my ai bets but some of the increasingly high p e ratios concerned me . so i sold them and purchased more nvidia. this approach is considered risky but i have strong conviction in their relative valuation defensibility and long term prospects. in this case i believe that diversification among ai stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. particularly because they re all highly correlated and despite its market cap nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. we ll see if the bet pays off. to clarify i am confident in the long term prospects of palantir tesla and others but i m just not comfortable with the valuations. i may reassess in the future when i have new information or valuations change. meta is the only other stock i held onto given my bullish view on their ai and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation. unrealized meta 367.97 nvidia 117.05 nvidia s performance here is understated since i recently increased my holdings but it s up 200 since i initially purchased it last year after dithering for months. these returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights but i d like to maintain some anonymity around it. rate of return my annual return for this portfolio is 73.6 . investment thesis see a summary of my investment thesis in a tl dr ai is another secular trend like pcs the internet and mobile . the difference is that new technology like ai can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. the other difference is that nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. therefore the 350 run up over the last 12 months doesn t make nvidia the stock of the last year but rather it s the stock of the next decade. the recent 3x gain will be a blip compared to what s coming thanks to nvidia s cuda among nov. 2023 nvidia s dominance i m still working through my thoughts here but my strong conviction around nvidia comes in part from these observations nvidia is and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. it s unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast growing valuable industry while maintaining such a long term sustainable advantage. this advantage is due to unreasonable investments over decades making it hard to copy. ai will consistently make software easier to create thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies . despite their impressive growth nvidia is still supply constrained which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. we still underestimate the ai opportunity most importantly we ve barely scratched the surface of ai s opportunities and benefits. even the most ambitious targets

several pandemic stocks that had significant declines in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1 2 times a year. in q3 2023 i began reallocating into ai related stocks when i developed strong conviction. i m also working on a self funded ai startup which keeps me in the loop on ai. returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. there s more context in my previous updates linked below. previous updates progress updates below are the returns for this portfolio as of december 2024. realized in

snowflake 51.57 super micro computer 14.48 taiwan semiconductor 103.19 tesla 92.16 unity 8.73 short term capital gain loss held for 1yr i held several companies for a short time to spread out my ai bets but some of the increasingly high p e ratios concerned me . so i sold them and purchased more nvidia. this approach is considered risky but i have strong conviction in their relative valuation defensibility and long term prospects. in this case i believe that diversification among ai stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. particularly because they re all highly correlated and despite its market cap nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. we ll see if the bet pays off. to clarify i am confident in the long term prospects of palantir tesla and others but i m just not comfortable with the valuations. i may reassess in the future when i have new information or valuations change. meta is the only other stock i held onto given my bullish view on their ai and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation. unrealized meta 367.97 nvidia 117.05 nvidia s performance here is understated since i recently increased my holdings but it s up 200 since i initially purchased it last year after dithering for months. these returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights but i d like to maintain some anonymity around it. rate of return my annual return for this portfolio is 73.6 . investment thesis see a summary of my investment thesis in a tl dr ai is another secular trend like pcs the internet and mobile . the difference is that new technology like ai can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. the other difference is that nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. therefore the 350 run up over the last 12 months doesn t make nvidia the stock of the last year but rather it s the stock of the next decade. the recent 3x gain will be a blip compared to what s coming thanks to nvidia s cuda among nov. 2023 nvidia s dominance i m still working through my thoughts here but my strong conviction around nvidia comes in part from these observations nvidia is and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. it s unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast growing valuable industry while maintaining such a long term sustainable advantage. this advantage is due to unreasonable investments over decades making it hard to copy. ai will consistently make software easier to create thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies . despite their impressive growth nvidia is still supply constrained which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. we still underestimate the ai opportunity most importantly we ve barely scratched the surface of ai s opportunities and benefits. even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper ai gets the more use cases we ll find. we have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. our imaginations are trained on what happened before but there has never been anything like this before. final thoughts i m still well within the maybe i m just lucky phase since it s only been a couple years. towards the end of i also shared a

2024-12-17,2024-12-17 01:24:17,TSLA,Tesla,investing,ponzi spotting a laymen s guide to differentiating investments from ponzi schemes ponzi spotting a laymen s guide to differentiating investments from ponzi schemes [TITLE_END] i often see things being called ponzi schemes on reddit that are very much not ponzi schemes. usually it always stems from the criticism that a particular investment only goes up in price because someone newer is paying a higher price for it. hence it must be a ponzi. i m going to blow your minds a little bit. almost all investments require new investors willing to pay a higher price for older investors to cash out a profit. most investable objects regardless of what underlies the object trade at a price on a market. this means at the margin some percentage of the total available supply of the object is trading hands. the trade is priced typically in your local fiat currency but this does not necessarily have to be the case. prices are determined by supply and demand. when an investable object goes up in price on a market it means there were no sellers of the object at the lower price and price goes up until the next marginal seller decides they are willing to part with that object at the higher price. the use of the term investable object is intentionally left extremely broad. it essentially means anything quantifiable that can be owned and traded. this includes contracts stocks bonds physical objects digital objects etc. example 1. you bought a 1st edition charizard for 20 dollars when it came out in the 1990 s. since it was relatively abundant and pokemon was relatively new at the time the supply was high and the demand was low. fast forward 30 years pokemon is super popular and there are very few 1st edition charizards remaining . you now are able to sell the charizard for 10 000 dollars to a guy that just got into pokemon card collecting. congratulations you bought low and sold high was what you participated in a ponzi scheme because you made a profit by selling to a new investor i really hope your answer to this is no. if you think the answer is yes you can stop reading here because i don t think anything i m going to say beyond this point is going to help you. the next step in logic is realizing this charizard example is essentially how all investment returns are made when the investable object at hand is not providing a direct flow of cash. this is true for non dividend stocks derivatives physical collectibles like pet rocks beanie babies tulip bulbs and digital collectibles like in game skins nfts cryptocurrencies etc. examples of cash flowing investments would be dividend stocks direct ownership of small businesses such that net profits are available to you or rental properties. it is important to note while ultimately supply and demand determine if a price for an investable object goes up over time the underlying reason an investable object has demand at all can be wildly different from object to object. the reason some people want first edition charizards is usually a very different reason people want to own a stock of a company. it is within the eye of the investor to decide if the reason is a good reason and hopefully a reason that leads to increased demand in the future. so what is a ponzi according to chatgpt a ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment scam that promises high returns with little or no risk to investors. the scheme relies on using the funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors rather than generating legitimate profit from actual investments or business activities. eventually the scheme collapses when it becomes impossible to recruit enough new investors or when too many existing investors try to withdraw their money at the same time. that seems like a pretty good definition to me the part that everyone focuses on when thinking about a ponzi is this part the scheme relies on using funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors. this sounds extremely similar to my charizard example yet i hope you have the intellectual honesty to accept that a real ponzi scheme is different from buying low and selling high. the part that is extremely important in addition to old investor returns being funded by new investors is that the scheme promises a return. the reality is that many ponzi schemes do not start off as ponzi schemes. there are sometimes investment funds that partake briefly in ponzi like behavior to paper over potential insolvency during a downturn and then return to legitimate investment activities when the market improves. doing this is quite risky and is still illegal because if you aren t able to essentially over deliver on future returns to even things out you re essentially stuck in an endless cycle of repaying old investors who cash out with newer investor money turning your once legitimate investment fund into a ponzi scheme. the right move is to always be open and honest about what returns you re able to achieve for your investors to avoid being stuck in the ponzi loop i described. another attribute of ponzi schemes is that ponzi s almost always violently collapse once the perceived value of the fund goes down. this is because once a ponzi stops attracting new money it becomes apparent very quickly that the liabilities of the fund far outstrip the assets. example 2. imagine a hypothetical ponzi scheme. the ponzi fund initially accepted $1 000 dollars from 10 eager investors in a local town. the fund manager promises a 10 annual yield so that in 1 year s time any of the original investors can withdraw $1 100 if they so please. unfortunately our manager really sucks at operating this ponzi and after 1 year obtains exactly zero new clients. his liabilities at the end of the year are now $11 000 but he only has $10 000 of cash on hand. even more unfortunately for him taylor swift is announced to be coming to town and tickets are on sale now and the tickets incidentally cost $1 100. all his investors want to cash out immediately so they ask for their money back. the first 9 that come to him are able to get their money back . when the 10th person comes back he realizes there s only $100 for him not the $1 100 he was promised the fund not only has basically no money left it owes $1000. the 10th person notifies the police and our unfortunate fund manager is arrested for fraud. i will note that in this example this scheme required 90 of the investors to withdraw for the scheme to collapse but examples in history tend to be much more skewed where even a small withdrawal of 1 5 of investors can completely collapse the scheme. returning to the investable object definition once a ponzi runs out of new investors to pay prior investors the investable object completely disappears because the fund you thought was flush with desirable investable objects actually had a negative cash balance the entire time behind the curtain there actually was no object at all. this is in contrast to our buy low sell high example with the charizard card. the charizard market could hypothetically collapse tomorrow such that the market price drops from $10 000 to $1. maybe everyone collectively realizes pokemon is super lame and that yugioh is the superior card game. at the end of the day there are two truths you still own the investable object aka the charizard and no one promised you a return for owning it. you can always wait it out hoping that people become interested in charizards again. i hope this somewhat lengthy piece was helpful in elucidating ponzi schemes for anyone that read this far. i often see clearly non ponzi investable objects being echo chambered as ponzi s on reddit when it really stems from a misunderstanding of the investable object or the mechanics of investment itself. if your investable object trades on an open market and nominal gains are made through price increases due to supply and demand dynamics it is almost certainly not a ponzi. if nobody is promising you a return it also probably isn t a ponzi. this does not mean your investable object itself is not a scam or a bubble. that determination should be made with your best judgment of the fundamentals that underlie the object itself. i will leave you with 2 final examples to illustrate this. example 3. tesla stock is neither a ponzi nor a scam . it might be a bubble if you think the company s market cap is too high for what its future profits will be. example 4. nikola stock is not a ponzi but it was a scam. the ceo lied to investors about how functional the cars were and how many they sold .

2024-12-18,2024-12-18 08:50:26,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,nvidia s recent decline and opportunities for a new rally nvidia s recent decline and opportunities for a new rally [TITLE_END] nvidia fell nearly 4 today before narrowing the loss to 1.22 . since hitting a record closing high of $148.88 in early november the ai chip maker s stock has dropped over 10 . so what is causing nvidia s decline 1. supply chain issues and challenges nvidia faces multiple challenges in its supply chain a significant factor in its stock decline. first according to the latest data the order volume and schedules for the gb200 and gb300 have been adjusted. particularly the mass production and shipment of gb series products have been postponed until after the lunar new year in february increasing market uncertainty. additionally the small scale production plans for gb300 face tight deadlines putting pressure on gb200 s mass production. specific supply chain issues include cowos l packaging technology heating problems copper cable connections and leakage issues. these not only affect product yield rates but also increase system integration time costs. consequently nvidia has suggested customers purchase the b200 8 card hgx as a transitional solution and clients like microsoft are considering switching their orders. these supply chain issues affect nvidia s product delivery capabilities and reduce market expectations for its future performance. 2. market competition and narrative changes asics are gaining market recognition as a competitive narrative. asics are chips designed for specific tasks akin to custom running shoes for a race. for certain tasks asics outperform nvidia s gpus and are potentially cheaper. openai co founder ilya and industry leaders like microsoft s ceo satya have started discussing the importance of not only training ai models but also ensuring they can quickly and accurately make decisions in real applications. this shift in perspective gives asics an advantage in some scenarios as they are designed for rapid precise execution of tasks. this raises questions about the cost of nvidia s gpus. while powerful they are expensive and require significant electricity and cooling. as asics perform better at lower costs for some tasks there s consideration of replacing nvidia s gpus with asics. additionally changes in scaling law narratives and the strengthening of inference narratives pose threats to nvidia. scaling laws suggest that increasing ai model size typically improves performance but these gains are not infinite and require significant computational resources. this means nvidia must continually invest resources to improve product performance potentially increasing costs. moreover companies like btc tesla and google are investing heavily in their own ai chips or solutions. this intensifies market competition and challenges nvidia s leadership. 3. market sentiment and capital flows market sentiment and capital flow significantly impact nvidia s stock price. as the year ends retail investors etfs and institutions adjust their portfolios. fluctuations in tech giants like microsoft apple and google affect tech stocks like nvidia. investors are more cautious favoring stable promising companies. given these conditions nvidia faces pressure on its stock price due to supply chain issues and competition. lowered expectations for nvidia s future performance lead to capital outflows and stock price declines. 4. future outlook and catalysts despite current challenges nvidia has opportunities for a turnaround. first nvidia needs to resolve supply chain issues improve product yield and delivery capabilities. second strengthening its presence in software and applications is crucial to addressing market competition. additionally nvidia should explore new computing narratives to expand its computing potential. 5. technical analysis and price divergence previously prices rose continuously but volume and kdj began to decline showing divergence. without capital support upward momentum was insufficient leading to a short term adjustment and a break below the mid term trend line resulting in a mid term adjustment. when might a new rally occur from a technical analysis perspective after two prior mid term adjustments breaking the downward trend line may signal the start of a new rally. thus this new rally must first break the resistance line. from a catalyst perspective while january s ces and the earnings release in late february may not bring major surprises march s gtc is worth anticipating. nvidia needs to showcase new technologies and products at this event to restore market confidence. if nvidia can introduce groundbreaking innovations a stock rebound is possible.

2024-12-18,2024-12-18 20:17:31,TSLA,Tesla,wallstreetbets,self driving business grows 6x uber is clearly misplaced by the market and is on the verge of 50 upside self driving business grows 6x uber is clearly misplaced by the market and is on the verge of 50 upside [TITLE_END] shares of uber have fallen more than 30 from their october 2024 highs in just a few weeks on concerns that self driving cars could eliminate intermediary services while news such as google s waymo skipping uber to enter the self driving cab business in miami is thought provoking enough to make some investors uneasy uber s positioning as the transportation app for everyone an aggregator of all transportation needs for more than 160 million consumers makes it an inevitable market platform for self driving car companies. this makes it an inevitable market platform for self driving car companies. tesla and google have deep pockets but building a bilateral network of self driving cabs from scratch would cost tens of billions of dollars take years to achieve scalable economics and make it difficult to change customer behavior despite the novelty of driverless cabs. additionally uber has partnered with several av providers to bring self driving cabs to its platform from an economic standpoint it makes more sense to partner with uber as an av supplier than to try to create demand on a new network of self driving cabs with a limited and expensive av fleet. now in the past uber s leadership team has used self driving cars as tam extenders which is the right thought process as increased supply in the form of robo taxis could potentially lower uber s cost per mile which in turn would push penetration and total bookings higher the growth of the self driving car market will unfold over the next decade or two so it seems premature to abandon uber based on concerns about disintermediation. as long as uber s business grows as planned there s no reason to panic sell. on the contrary uber stock s recent decline has significantly improved its long term risk reward with tqi s five year expected compound annual growth rate for uber jumping from 16.1 to 25.8 . based on forward looking estimates uber s revenue will continue to grow at a healthy double digit rate over the next five years as a result in today s valuation the analysts are sticking with the growth and margin assumptions used in their previous assessment of uber. that is updating uber s revenue base to $43.71 billion and updating the stock count to 2.154 billion shares. all other assumptions remain unchanged and relatively simple. based on the valuation model uber s fair value is approximately $105.50 per share or currently undervalued by approximately 45 . in addition given the sharp decline uber s long term risk reward has improved considerably. given its 5 year expected compound annual growth rate is currently about 25.8 well above our 15 investment threshold rate. in a historically expensive stock market uber is now one of the few large tech stocks that offer amazing value uber is making every effort to become a reliable money printing machine. given uber s fast growing cash flow production and the shareholder friendly capital allocation policies adopted by management investors had plenty of margin of safety in this large tech stock. now uber stock is finally pulling back. yes uber s image has been poor due to recent self driving cab developments however uber s business is in good shape with continued strong sales and profitability growth in q3 2024 uber s total bookings increased 16 year over year to $40.97 billion driven by healthy growth in mapc and mapc usage frequency . additionally uber s cash conversion continued to improve at a rapid pace in q3 with free cash flow increasing 133 year over year to $2.1 billion. from a technical perspective uber shares are above the 100 week moving average which could be strong support. additionally the 200 week moving average is at $47. given that uber s weekly rsi is near oversold territory the $47 $57 range is a strong buy zone for long term investors.

[TITLE_END] stopped who cares how i did it if you re losing you should stop and start thinking but anyways here s my current play. don t do what i m doing as i have other investments apart from those high risk high reward. when you are pushed in a corner you must study read listen watch countless of hours and i promise you will make it through warning i am heavily invested in high risk etfs i wil name them bellow . i started accumulating this week. all roads lead to rome in the short term all signs point to strong returns driven by america s economic exceptionalism. i expect significant gains by early or mid 2025 from the following positions etf tna . etf udow . etf fas . etf 3x bull etf ether ethu why not by the end of the year a market correction in the early or mid part of 2025 is a real possibility which is why i m positioning for the short term gains a key reminder from a legendary investor one of the most respected fixed income investors of all time whom warren buffett sought advice from mark howard s once said the market can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent. you may think the market is overpriced but the premium you re paying for american stocks is justified because the u.s. is the world s greatest economy. keep in mind this is from someone that does not invest a penny in securities or seldom does and continues to buy bonds when the 2008 crash occurred he was considered one of the smartest since his portfolio barely took a hit and made billions upon billions afterwards. he greatly reminds us that investing is a losers game and predicting the future is not possible on that note you can for certain know that whatever what happened in the past is not a good indication of future performance but you can be certain that you can analyze today and today is american economic exceptionalism for dummies this means that there is no greater economy american exceptionalism was a political word used by the early settlers. almost every president uses it but today you are actually living it . a beacon light upon a hill in which the eyes of the world is set up on us an example to the world. i have a minor in political science once i thought it would be useless to study . i did for fun what i know for sure while i can t predict what will happen tomorrow here s what i can say about today job market there s never been a better time to find a job. boomers are retiring in large numbers and younger generations aren t filling those gaps. with immigration restrictions tightening job openings will continue to rise. interest rates inflation whether rates go up down or stay the same any shift is just an opportunity to buy. despite inflation gdp growth will likely outpace any downturns. all signs point to a strong american economy. political environment the new administration may bring volatility and media distractions but over time you ll get used to it. and the market will get use to it in fact it will become almost meaningless . as long as the economy remains strong those disruptions won t matter. final thought from warren buffett in buffett s words america is like a train that keeps moving forward picking up more passengers along the way. occasionally it may get derailed or need to stop but it will always get back on track and keep moving forward. you will never know why he sold yet is it because his age is it because he actually believes at the market is overvalued if so he would have listen to mark howard s in his recent interview i believe it is more of a shifting of strategy plus or minus his given age and his future holdings not a reflection of what he believes about the american economy current holdings pltr sold 2 3 at 400 gain rest are locked forever tsla 170 average any major dip is honey the cinderal story baba the chinese awakening uber purchased at 61$ hood 20$ i see other opportunities trow the finance story block finance story broadcom and nvdia are both to be owned

[TITLE_END] recently the popularity of ai software has been steadily increasing. as ai narratives have entered their second phase application level development companies like applovin and palantir which have seen their revenues multiply in just one year are becoming more prominent. moreover in the past couple of months the performance of the software sector has clearly outpaced that of the semiconductor sector. today i d like to share with you a recent report from the investment bank jefferies titled ai software the hot debate of 2025 . in this report we explore whether ai software will experience explosive growth in the u.s. stock market by 2025 and which companies stand the best chance of benefiting. this report is 240 pages long. in addition to covering five major market debates it also includes detailed assessments of over ten companies in the ai software space with around ten pages dedicated to each company. this makes it an excellent resource for anyone looking to understand the ai software landscape. key takeaway although revenue growth will remain modest through 2025 and 2026 it is recommended to begin positioning for promising companies now. microsoft google amazon and meta are among the key players mentioned. here are some interesting insights from the report 1. will ai software explode in 2025 software revenue will gradually increase but it won t experience the same explosive growth as semiconductors. if semiconductor growth is likened to a rocket software is more like an airplane . the turning point for ai s impact on software revenue is expected to occur in the second half of 2025 . the growth sequence will follow the natural order of business first infrastructure like cloud computing then application software . full deployment will take 1 3 years with a more significant share of the market occurring after 2026 . 2. what is the return on ai investments this has been a recurring topic this year and the positive arguments are becoming more abundant sales from backlogged orders have exceeded capital expenditures by 111 . successful ai applications continue to emerge particularly in areas like code development media tools and scientific research. adoption of ai in front office functions like it and sales is accelerating with ai expected to represent 80 of enterprise applications. 3. why is microsoft a good bet despite its underperformance this year among the major tech companies microsoft s performance this year has been rather average. since the launch of chatgpt its stock has underperformed the ishares expanded tech software etf by 19 . however microsoft is poised to benefit from two major waves of software development azure ai in infrastructure and m365 copilot in applications. the company stands to gain from openai s growth receiving 20 of openai s revenue. as openai s exclusive cloud service provider microsoft will also earn a significant portion of openai s expenditures including future model training costs. ai related revenue is expected to grow from 3 of total revenue to 10 by 2026 . azure ai is projected to contribute $15 billion in 2026 while m365 copilot will contribute another $13 billion. and this is what i concluded in 2025 the broader growth in ai software will likely be driven by its applications across various industries. for instance applovin has surged by 750 this year thanks to its innovative use of ai in advertising. similarly carvana has risen by around 320 fueled by ai applications in the used car market. there are also many ai related stocks in industries yet to be fully discovered. for example aix inc. is a small cap company applying ai software in the insurance sector. its ai models focus on areas like intelligent customer service sales enablement and could eventually expand into personalized product pricing underwriting claims processing and risk management. while its stock has not seen significant growth yet it could potentially benefit from a market surge in ai software by 2025 revealing a bright future. in summary the ai software sector s explosive growth is not just about tech companies it s about how ai can transform a wide range of industries. investors who position themselves early may see significant returns as the sector matures. $app $cvna $aifu

[TITLE_END] the nvidia blackwell b300 series processors excel in a number of ways that make them an important breakthrough in ai big data and hyperscale computing 1. dramatic performance improvements the b300 series delivers a 50 increase in compute performance over the b200 series. this performance increase is not only achieved through more compute cores and higher clock frequencies but also through a more optimized 4np process . for applications that need to process complex ai models the b300 delivers more efficient computing power especially in the areas of machine learning deep learning and high performance computing. 2. extra memory and bandwidth the b300 is equipped with a 12 hi hbm3e memory stack providing 288gb of memory and 8tb s of bandwidth. the increased memory capacity enables it to handle larger datasets making it particularly suitable for training large language models and handling long sequence inference tasks. higher memory bandwidth accelerates data access and processing reduces latency and improves model inference and training efficiency. 3. lower inference cost since the b300 supports processing larger batches and extended sequence lengths it significantly reduces latency in the inference process and lowers inference costs. for example the ability to triple inference efficiency allows the full computational power of each gpu to be utilized thus reducing the cost required to generate the number of tokens per second. 4. innovative interconnect technology the b300 utilizes the 800g connectx 8 nic which provides twice the bandwidth of its predecessor for large scale clusters and supports more pcie lanes . this enables more efficient data sharing across multiple gpus significantly improving overall cluster throughput and computing efficiency making it ideal for large scale distributed and cloud computing applications. 5. more flexible supply chain and customization nvidia has changed its traditional sales model by no longer supplying complete server hardware but instead offering core components such as sxm puck modules and grace cpus to oems and odms allowing customers to customize them according to their needs. this change brings higher flexibility and scalability to better adapt to the needs of different enterprises especially for hyperscale data centers and cloud computing vendors where customization can improve overall performance and efficiency. 6. higher scalability for hyperscale organizations the b300 s nvlink 72 architecture enables 72 gpus to collaborate on the same problem with low latency. compared to traditional 8 gpu configurations the b300 significantly improves batch size scalability reduces costs and increases the intelligence of the inference chain. this makes the b300 computationally and economically efficient for large scale inference tasks. 7. efficient cooling and energy management although the power consumption of the b300 series has increased the b300 is able to dynamically allocate and adjust power between the cpu and gpu to maximize overall energy efficiency thanks to a more efficient dynamic power allocation mechanism. additionally its design allows for a more efficient water cooling system which helps reduce operating costs and improve system stability. value proposition improved computing efficiency the b300 series is capable of handling larger datasets and more complex ai models making it suitable for organizations that require high performance computing such as those in the areas of deep learning inference services large scale ai model training and other applications. reduced inference costs with higher memory capacity and bandwidth the b300 significantly reduces the cost per inference and improves economics which is a huge value add for cloud providers or organizations offering ai services. flexible customization nvidia s new supply chain model enables organizations to choose the most appropriate hardware configuration for their needs reducing overall procurement costs and increasing flexibility. underpinning hyperscale computing the b300 is a significant technology upgrade for data centers cloud giants and other hyperscale computing platforms helping them scale compute capacity more efficiently and improve performance. in summary the b300 series not only brings significant improvements in multiple aspects such as performance memory bandwidth and energy management but also provides greater adaptability and scalability through a flexible supply chain and customized design helping enterprises achieve higher efficiency and lower operating costs in large scale computing and ai applications.

2024-12-30,2024-12-30 16:54:41,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,the top 5 performing stocks of the past decade have one thing in common the top 5 performing stocks of the past decade have one thing in common [TITLE_END] the five best performing stocks of the past decade nvidia amd camtek fair isaac and tesla have one thing in common their stock prices have all experienced at least one drop of 50 or more. for example tesla s stock dropped by more than 70 and nvidia experienced a 66 decline in 2022. these sharp fluctuations caused many investors to panic and sell. however if we had sold during these major drops we would have missed out on the subsequent huge gains these stocks have had compound annual growth rates ranging from 40 to 75 for instance if you had invested $10 000 in tesla ten years ago it would now be worth $290 000 and nvidia return is even more impressive with a $10 000 investment now worth nearly $2.7 million this made me realize that an important investment principle is to let your winners keep winning while there are only a few winners in the market if we can hold on to them in our portfolio the returns can be very significant. however to do this investors need to overcome the fear of large price fluctuations and avoid selling when prices drop it is often only after such fluctuations that these stocks experience the next big rise investment guru charlie munger once said if you can t calmly endure a 50 drop in stock prices two or three times you re not suited to be a common shareholder i have come to understand that market volatility is inevitable and investors must learn to accept significant price swings and remain calm during downturns the key is to have a clear investment thesis when buying stocks understand the company s long term value and compare the company s performance to your judgment. if things are progressing as expected holding on is usually a good idea because it gives you confidence during market turbulence in summary one of the most important investment principles is to continue holding on to the stocks that are performing well even if they experience significant volatility. volatility is part of the market and only by having strong conviction can we maintain long term returns through market turbulence

2025-01-01,2025-01-01 08:36:43,TSLA,Tesla,investing,bitcoin isn t unique but infinite $100k is beyond absurd bitcoin isn t unique but infinite $100k is beyond absurd [TITLE_END] imagine this air the most abundant and freely available resource on earth. everyone can breathe it without restriction it s everywhere and it costs nothing. now imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles claiming only 21 million bottles will ever exist. they sell the bottles marketing them as rare and special and soon the price of a single bottle soars to $100 000. but here s the catch anyone can grab the same air bottle it themselves impose their own arbitrary limits and sell it too. the air inside these bottles is identical same purity same ability to sustain life. yet somehow the original company convinces people their air is unique while the others are dismissed as worthless. this isn t just absurd but comically irrational. and yet it s a perfect analogy for bitcoin. think about it bottling air to sell is ridiculous. why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available worse imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system one consuming massive amounts of electricity requiring complex networks and involving global participants to package transfer and store this bottled air. this is the level of absurdity we reach with bitcoin. bitcoin s defenders often point to its decentralization anonymity and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. but what is this decentralized system really securing digital air. the units being produced transferred and protected represent nothing they are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. anyone with the technical knowledge can clone bitcoin s code impose their own arbitrary cap and launch their own cryptocurrency. this brings us to the critical difference between bitcoin and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless. stocks represent ownership in a company. a company cannot be copied like a piece of code. the value of a share is tied to the performance assets and operations of that unique entity. you cannot clone tesla or apple and therefore you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite tied to real world assets operations and innovation. fiat currencies on the other hand represent units of debt. they are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers companies governments or individuals to repay them. banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. no one can walk into a bank and request a trillion dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it. cryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. if you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow nothing stops you. bitcoin s 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the bitcoin protocol adjust the parameters and produce trillions of coins in their own system. in this way cryptocurrencies represent nothing no ownership no debt no tangible connection to the real economy. they are the digital equivalent of bottling air infinitely replicable with no inherent value. bitcoin s defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable likening it to gold. but unlike gold bitcoin s scarcity is artificial and replicable. limiting bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming we re only producing 21 million bottles. the air is still abundant and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits. the absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing transferring and storing these digital tokens. bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations and yet what is being protected a digital representation of air something freely available infinitely replicable and ultimately meaningless. bitcoin s price doesn t reflect the value of its features. if decentralization anonymity and security were truly valuable bitcoin s clones many of which improve on these features would share its valuation. instead bitcoin s price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. people aren t paying $100 000 because bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency they re paying because they believe someone else will pay more. this speculative bubble cannot last. once people recognize that bitcoin s features are infinitely replicable and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost the illusion will collapse. bitcoin isn t digital gold nor is it a revolutionary asset. it s a digital air packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. paying $100 000 for a single bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. the elaborate decentralized system supporting bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost. when the hype fades and the absurdity of the system becomes clear bitcoin s price will plummet leaving behind the inescapable truth no rational person should pay a

2025-01-01,2025-01-01 18:11:17,TSLA,Tesla,wallstreetbets,gains are not worth the risk gains are not worth the risk [TITLE_END] i wrote this in the hopes of saving some of you future heartache and irreversible trauma. i lost 110k over the past month. the majority after options calls during the bloodbath after december fed meeting. if i could go back to my past self i would say this. the loss isn t worth the potential gains. before i was just burnt out from my job. but at least i was proud to have saved up my first 100k. now im burnt out down 3 years of savings and have a lot less freedom in my life. i can t focus on work i m depressed and can t find joy in my hobbies anymore. i m probably in the process of ruining my relationship as well. even if i had won i definitely don t think i d be happier an equivalent amount. life is hard. if you worked hard and earned some money. dont make degenerate bets. the vast majority of us are just normal humans who should just save their time and invest in part index fund and part cash equivalents. or maybe this marks the bottom and it is a buying opportunity. your choice. edit was only expecting maybe max 100 upvotes but i guess i said something that resonates. after wading through the comments insults memes etc. i was touched by enough kind people reaching out to add some more. i dont think i can stomach another comment reading though so please dont expect me to react anymore. notifications are off. posted a 80k loss screenshot of part of my portfolio. another 30k was lost in another account. 1. only bet what you can afford to lose doesn t really make sense. dont use that saying to convince yourself to make risky gambles. i could afford to lose 110k in the sense that i won t starve i would still have a roof over my head and i still have 30k i left that i promised to myself i wouldnt touch. but i lost things i didn t expect. like my passions for my hobbies a healthy exercise habit my mental health after recovering from depression during college. even during the time i was trading i also hated how it felt. i was glued to the ticker and was losing connection with real life relationships. before you use the money you think you are willing to lose. try spending a part of that amount on yourself. get yourself some luxuries some experiences maybe travel take a sabbatical from work or spend it on someone close to you. its all numbers on the screen when trading so its easy to lose a sense of it all. afterwards imagine losing the ability to do all that and only proceed if youre ok with that. 2. for those who think this isnt something a normal person could go through. i saved roughly 60 70 of my paycheck the past 3 years. i made sacrifices on lifestyle and luxuries. 3. for those that still want to go on i sure cant stop you. maybe some of us need to learn a lesson firsthand. might be better even to learn early on before you have a family with hundreds of thousands saved up over decades. this might help. looking back i definitely had chances to make money. i was thinking about rklb when it was $5 . i had a chance to jump into rddt when it was still $80. i considered googl at 165 since the bad news seemed overblown. even at my most insane already down 50k before i lost it all i almost went all in in on christmas eve with 1 week dte options on tsla calls. instead i did it on the friday afterwards hoping for a similar bounce to recover the from the drop after fed earnings. if you get into single stocks crypto options it s a lot riskier. youre going to have to be lucky with the timing. youre also going to have to be disciplined with your strategy. when you make your bet. if you win stop. i hope you become happy. i hope you get more time to pursue your passions. to spend time with family and friends. to become a person you are proud of. if you lose i hope you recover. never gamble again. life will be harder. but maybe we can still find a part of that happiness. i dont think we really want money. we just want a more human experience.
2025-01-01,2025-01-01 18:34:44,TSLA,Tesla,pennystocks,airspace batteries is positioning itself to be the next $kulr $abtt $kulr airspace batteries is positioning itself to be the next $kulr $abtt $kulr [TITLE_END] not financial advice. do your own due diligence before you invest. congrats to everyone who saw gains from $abtt on tuesday. considering it was a down day for most other stocks i ll happily take a 24 gain. however airspace batteries is likely due for at least one more surge in january. with high earnings per share cutting edge tech and large institutional buy in there is a chance this could be the next $kulr. market cap $98.2mil current price $2.54 52 week range $0.81 2.67 1. recent developments has developed a new patented lithium ion battery in 2023 which can store charge 12 better than its competitors. it s now out the research and development phase and the company is now laser focused on securing contracts with several buyers interested. reported net profit of $0.4 eps in their latest earnings report which is mind boggling considering they ve been focused on developing their products. analysts expect this to soar in 2025 and 2026. partnerships and acquisitions interest from the military with a rumoured partnership with a well known carmaker. 2. history and product quite a new company as it was founded in 2019 by mit alumni jordan hughes a serial entrepreneur who founded pop rocketr before its acquisition for $1.6mil. hughes was unhappy with the state of electric car batteries and wanted to turbocharge progress so the next generation of batteries could be launched today. inspired by his wife s pent up rage towards his business ventures hughes wanted the battery to store an additional 86 charge than tesla and duracell batteries. so far results are positive with a single cheetah outlasting the latter by over 370 . the implications of this are massive as you could charge your phone in twice the speed as a conventional charger. hughes is hoping to shrink the cheetah by 10x so it can eventually stand comfortably on your desk. $abtt raised a staggering $30mil last year when hughes approached a renown loan shark for capital in exchange for repayment. sadly not realising the loan shark was connected to the mob hughes has struggled to repay on time due to the cutting edge research and development costs that come with building a battery. this has resulted in hughes losing his two best typing figures with analysts predicting double digit losses by 2027 if capital is not repaid. however hughes remains optimistic that he can repay once his bitcoin treasury pays dividends . however their main market is electric vehicles. the results are coming in and $abtt batteries are outperforming their competitors by a country mile one study has found that when fitted in an electric car of your choice the cheetah battery can outlast the car s lifespan by over 10 years . critics have argued this is due to the battery shorting the car s circuits rendering it unusable. however hughes has since successfully made the case in court that you should diversify your car holdings to allow for combustible fuel engines as well. 3. detailed financial analysis and developments where most companies often struggle turning a profit until their research and development stage is over $abtt has already started to turn profitable bringing in a whopping $0.4 per share in earnings. there are currently no plans for dilution in the next 6 12 days and analysts are positive that the eps could even rise to $0.41 next quarter. airspace batteries shocked the investing world when they announced a bold plan to create a massive bitcoin treasury this financial quarter using net cash. investors have been cautiously optimistic as the company has already allocated funds for a whopping 685 485 satoshis. their crypto broker has confirmed this is the maximum amount of bitcoin you can buy per financial year and hughes has stated that this justifies spending 68 of their net cash on cryptocurrency and fees. there are already plans next financial quarter to buy the rest of the bitcoin. institutional investors are now observing whether this bold move will bring big returns but considering the success of other companies with bitcoin treasuries i think this can only mean good things. net revenue for the last financial year was $23mil a 90 increase on the financial year before . 4. growth drivers for next 5 years. a. the demand for lithium ion batteries is expanding by 18 per year with no signs of stopping . futurologists are already predicting the end of combustible engine batteries which means there will be a market void to fill. $abtt is well positioned to get a big slice of that pie. b. with current price indicators remaining bullish on crypto over the next 5 years analysts are confident that the newly established bitcoin treasury will likely boost revenues by an eye watering $3.6. the c.e.o jordan hughes has a great record for promoting his company online and shows no sign of stopping. this has increased visibility in the company by 600 since august last year. he has also made numerous media appearances whilst giving out flyers on wall street. this will likely pay dividends in the company s future. 5. potential risks airspace batteries is a relatively new company so will have difficulty jostling for a bigger slice of the market compared to its competitors. hughes is a notorious gambler often taking his company s revenue to vegas each financial quarter and betting it all on the roulette table. this has been a risky strategy but has paid off at least 2 6 times so far. however hughes is looking to pivot his high risk high reward strategy towards poker. could more gains be on the horizon activist investors are unsure about whether to invest money in a company where the mob has a 48 stake in it. however analysts are predicting that with such big institutional buy in that this should ensure stability towards the company s success. it s always worth doing due diligence with a company of this type. in summary $abtt is a high risk high reward play that could pay big in 2025. as the company is out of its research and development phase with huge institutional buy in airspace batteries can now focus on acquiring customers and finally take on big battery. with investors already looking for the next $kulr i hope you make money not financial advice. do your own due diligence before you invest. $abtt $abtt $kulr $abtt $abtt $abtt $abtt $abtt $kulr

[TITLE_END] i do not understand why people ask for a price target. point prediction is just stupid because no one knows where the price will be in a certain time. price fluctuations are natural for small cap stocks especially if assaulted by big investors that can easily move the price up down so don t be scared of losses and don t get too excited for gains. this company has potential to grow and i am not the only one believing in this. let s talk about numbers revenue growth 436 y o y . liquidity current ratio improved to 4.86 in 2024 from 3.27 in 2023 showing they have the cash to fund growth without immediate risks. scaling phase net losses grew by 316 tied to r d and scaling i.e. typical sign of a company transitioning to higher revenue tiers . not to mention how their products can be disruptive. rvsn is developing ai powered railway safety systems that have the potential to revolutionize rail transportation 1. safety first their technology detects obstacles on railway tracks in real time even in low visibility conditions. this could dramatically reduce accidents saving lives and preventing costly disruptions. 2. global adoption potential rail safety is a $100b global market with increasing investments in automation and ai driven solutions. rvsn s technology fits perfectly into this growing trend. 3. market expansion opportunities beyond railways this tech could expand into metro systems industrial automation or even other safety critical industries opening doors to multiple revenue streams. i can reference every single number. be also aware that the company almost achieved nasdaq compliance. this will let institutional investors gaining even more confidence... i am holding shares with a long term perspective and i will buy more every time it dips kisses to everyone.

trader then you ll know there s all kinds of info that gets thrown your way and you don t really know what s useful and what isn t. you can use chatgpt to filter out some of that info and also because many people ask how they can backtest a strategy then this is also useful. below is an example of how i used chatgpt to do a simple backtest. as long as your strategy has definite rules for entry exit risk etc then you can do this. for example you may have heard that macd is a good indicator well it can be but below is a test using only the macd indicator on eur usd daily chart over the last 5 years and using entry exit rules that a typical beginner trader might use. 1. can you backtest eur usd on daily timeframe for the last 5 years using following rules 1. when macd cross up open long trade at candle close with stop loss 2 pips under candle low. 2. when macd cross down open short trade at candle close with stop loss 2 pips above candle high. 3. exit trade when macd crosses back in opposite direction. 4. risk 1 of capital per trade starting capital is 10 000usd 2. i can run a backtest based on the rules you ve outlined. here s a breakdown of how i ll proceed steps to backtest data collection i ll fetch eur usd historical data for the daily timeframe for the last 5 years. macd calculation compute the macd indicator and identify crossovers. trading logic long when macd crosses up and close trade when macd crosses down. short when macd crosses down and close trade when macd crosses up. risk management use a stop loss as specified . risk 1 of capital per trade. capital tracking track account balance and calculate the performance. i ll begin by fetching the historical eur usd data and proceed with the backtest. let me set up the calculations. it seems that the required library to fetch the historical data isn t installed in my current environment. let me approach this differently i can guide you to download the eur usd historical data from platforms like yahoo finance or any trading platform you use . alternatively you can upload a csv file of eur usd daily historical data and i can proceed with the backtesting. would you like to upload the data or should i provide instructions for downloading it 3. i then uploaded the necessary eur usd historical data in a csv file. you can download currency pair data from various sites just google forex currency pair historical data . it needs to be in .csv file form. you can make a .csv file really easy in google sheets it s just copy paste stuff. 4. great you ve uploaded the historical data file. let me take a look at the contents to ensure it s suitable for the backtest. i ll load and inspect the data now. the uploaded file appears to contain historical eur usd data but the column names are not properly labeled. based on the data structure the columns likely represent the following date time open high low close volume i ll rename the columns appropriately and ensure the data is ready for the backtest. let me proceed. the data is now cleaned and ready for analysis. it contains the following columns date the trading date. open high low close the respective prices for each day. volume trading volume . next i ll calculate the macd indicator and implement the backtesting logic based on your rules. let me proceed. the macd and signal line have been successfully calculated and added to the dataset. now i ll implement the backtesting logic based on your rules entry conditions open a long position when the macd crosses above the signal line. open a short position when the macd crosses below the signal line. exit conditions close the position when the macd crosses in the opposite direction. risk management set stop loss 2 pips below or above the entry candle. position sizing risk 1 of the capital per trade. let me implement this logic and simulate the trades. the backtesting is complete here s a summary key results initial capital $10 000 final capital $5 951.49 number of trades 94 example of trade history date type entry stop loss size exit pnl 2018 01 02 buy 1.20614 1.20058 17985.61 1.19698 164.75 2018 01 12 buy 1.21993 1.20381 6101.27 1.23666 102.07 2018 03 06 buy 1.24155

variations of the strategy to improve results. let me know how you d like to proceed 5. that s it. if you like you can go on to ask chatgpt to visualize the results in the form of an equity curve calculate data such as sharpe ratio profit factor max drawdown max losing streak etc etc. this was all done pretty quick and dirty but it s a very handy tool to use as part of your trading journey. so next time someone tries to sell you some fancy indicator or strategy if you have the indicator code or the strategy rules then you can test it for yourself before risking any real money or convincing yourself you ve found the holy grail.

2025-01-06,2025-01-06 12:55:55,TSLA,Tesla,wallstreetbets,new volkswagen leaks new volkswagen leaks [TITLE_END] alright degenerates strap in because this is why volkswagen might just be the juiciest short of 2025. spoiler alert this makes dieselgate look like a warmup. my position just opened a 0 4 delta 80 put on volkswagen for 5000 expiring 19th june 26. the chaos computer club just just revealed that volkswagen exposed the real time locations of 800 000 evs . that s right anyone with basic skills could pinpoint where your $40k ev is parked plus grab your name and contact info. vw literally left their cars and customers wide open for anyone to exploit. volkswagen s software arm cariad stored all this sensitive data on amazon web services without proper encryption or safeguards. let me say that again no encryption in 2025. that s amateur hour for a company that sells millions of cars. oh and this isn t the first time vw screwed the pooch on tech their software track record is garbage. here is the link to their video why this is bigger than dieselgate dieselgate cost volkswagen over $30 billion in fines lawsuits and buybacks. but that was emissions . this this is personal data names locations potential stalking targets and members of the bnd. we re living in the post gdpr era where the eu doesn t play nice with data breaches. fines for mishandling data can be as high as 4 of annual global turnover which for vw could mean billions. plus the reputational damage. there has not yet been a market reaction to the release of this video. also want to give you some reasons why you should not take my advice and short vw volkswagen is the biggest ev player in europe with about 25 market share. european people don t trust chinese vehicles and they don t trust elon musk. vw is grossly undervalued compared to tesla. we re talking 44 billion market cap vs. 1 279 billion for tesla. vw currently earns those 44 billion every four years. ccc did responsible disclosure and vw already fixed the breach. it will be hard to prove harm done to you. the german state is highly invested in vw eu regulations require automakers to collect and process vast amounts of data to comply with emissions standards safety protocols and ev monitoring. the breach highlights shortcomings but some responsibility lies with the regulatory framework. not financial advice.
2025-01-06,2025-01-06 19:04:38,TSLA,Tesla,investing,tesla s deliveries disappoint time to take profits tesla s deliveries disappoint time to take profits [TITLE_END] summary tesla s stock remains overvalued despite disappointing vehicle delivery numbers and slowing growth. the surge in tesla s stock price is driven by enthusiasm for ai advancements elon musk s charisma and donald trump s election victory rather than improvements in the company s core business fundamentals. at 126 times projected earnings tesla s valuation is far higher than both industry peers and even nvidia making it increasingly difficult to justify its current price. the company s challenges including declining deliveries suggest that much of its upside potential has already been priced in. investors should consider taking profits while the stock is trading at near record highs. tesla s stock has been riding a wave of unprecedented enthusiasm with its price reaching all time highs despite recently published delivery numbers that fell short of analysts expectations. this discrepancy highlights a growing disconnect between tesla s market valuation and its actual performance. the company once known for its relentless growth and innovation delivered fewer cars in 2024 than in 2023 marking its first ever year of declining deliveries. despite this tesla s stock price has surged by 63 in 2024 demonstrating how much investor sentiment rather than fundamental growth is driving its valuation. in my october analysis i discussed how tesla s slowing delivery growth and declining net income despite aggressive price cuts were becoming evident concerns. even the highly anticipated robotaxi event failed to deliver the excitement that investors had hoped for leading to a drop in the stock price at the time. while tesla was already trading at a premium then its valuation has only become more stretched in the months since. the most recent data on tesla s deliveries reveals troubling trends. in the fourth quarter of 2024 the company delivered 495 570 vehicles falling short of the 512 300 deliveries expected by analysts. this shortfall contributed to a total of 1.79 million vehicles delivered for the year a slight decline from the 1.81 million delivered in 2023. while the drop in deliveries may seem modest it is significant as it breaks tesla s streak of consistent year over year growth which had previously been a hallmark of its success. this is especially notable given the company s reliance on vehicle sales for approximately 80 of its revenue. without sustained growth in this area the rationale for holding tesla as a growth stock diminishes considerably. from 2020 to 2023 tesla experienced remarkable growth in deliveries with annual numbers climbing steadily. however 2024 marked a departure from this trend with sales stagnating and then declining. quarterly delivery figures also highlight the slowdown with growth peaking in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently stalling. this lack of growth is especially concerning for a company that reinvests all earnings into future expansion rather than paying dividends to shareholders. tesla s business model hinges on its ability to grow continuously and the absence of that growth undermines its investment appeal. despite these challenges tesla s stock has soared buoyed by investor excitement over its advancements in artificial intelligence elon musk s magnetic persona and the political implications of donald trump s recent election victory. musk has repeatedly emphasized tesla s position as a leader in ai and robotics which has further fueled optimism among investors. additionally tesla s stock experienced significant gains following the november election with investors speculating that trump s administration might ease regulations related to self driving technology. however such regulatory changes would only be beneficial if tesla achieves full autonomy an ambitious milestone that remains elusive. tesla s valuation underscores the risks of the current enthusiasm. the stock is now trading at an extraordinary 126 times projected earnings a multiple that far exceeds even ai powerhouse nvidia which trades at around 42 times earnings. comparisons with legacy automakers further highlight the disparity. tesla s market cap of $1.2 trillion is greater than that of the next 20 largest automakers combined yet it delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than in 2023. this disconnect raises questions about whether tesla s valuation can be justified in the absence of tangible growth. tesla s performance relative to nvidia provides another perspective on the stock s overvaluation. while both companies have benefited from their association with ai tesla s stock has outperformed nvidia s despite facing significant headwinds in its core business. this suggests that investor enthusiasm for tesla may be outpacing its actual achievements. although tesla remains a leader in ev production and is recognized for its innovative technologies including ai and robotics these factors are already priced into the stock. the company s market leadership positions it well to benefit from long term trends in ev adoption but its challenges in the short term including declining deliveries and uncertain profitability from new ventures make its current valuation appear precarious. in conclusion tesla s stock is trading at unsustainable levels given its recent performance. while the company s technological advancements and market leadership are undeniable its reliance on investor sentiment rather than business fundamentals makes it a risky investment at these prices. taking profits now would allow investors to capitalize on the stock s near record highs while avoiding potential losses should the market reassess tesla s valuation. while the enthusiasm surrounding tesla may persist in the short term prudence suggests that this is an opportune moment to exit the position.

has reached 2000 and 2021 levels. will this time be different [TITLE_END] three different u.s. stock market valuation models are flashing extreme overvaluation warning signs that were both last seen in 2000 and 2021. both 2000 and 2021 marked market euphoria highs and bear markets followed. you can make all your jokes that you want about gay bears successfully calling 420 of the last 69 recessions or what not but the undeniable fact is that the track record of these three valuation models showing strongly overvalued in unison is 2 for 2 in calling bear markets that followed very quickly. will history repeat itself again or is this time different there is also a fourth model the interest rate model which measures s p 500 valuation relative to current 10 year treasury rate. it hasn t quite hit the strongly overvalued line but it is pretty close to it. two recession risk models yield curve inversion and the sahm rule may be signaling a rough time as well. there is also the fed funds rate. it is showing a similar setup to previous cycles of rate hikes followed by rate holds followed by rate cuts followed by recession. the current setup looks similar to 2007 2008 especially. will the recession or bear market be cancelled this time with mission accomplished soft landing achieved here is the inflation adjusted s p 500 on a log scale chart. it has historically gone through a series of hot periods where the market beats inflation for roughly 15 years followed by cold periods where the market loses to inflation that last 10 years . the magnitude and time length of the current hot period looks like it could be giving way to a cold period soon if the overall historical cycle is followed. last but not least i ll list a few informal can t you just feel it it in the room type blow off top indicators of a potential market top 1. tesla stock doubled in price in like 1 2 months on shallow narratives not backed by numbers. an insane $750 billion market cap to an even more insane $1.5 trillion market cap in 1 2 months on a company earning roughly $13 billion annually and not growing much anymore. ludicrous. earnings have not exploded in line with stock price not nearly at all. i don t care what you tsla lovers say your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth. 2. palantir stock also doubled in price in like 1 2 months also on shallow narratives not backed by numbers. roughly $100 billion to $180 billion market cap with a price to sales ratio going from an insane 30x to an even more insane 67x. ludicrous. and i don t care what you pltr lovers say your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth. 3. 4. just the mentality of too many market participants buying ponzi scheme like assets or money burning trash companies at all in general often knowingly. like seriously why is this even a thing what the fuck is wrong with this market this shouldn t be happening... like at all. 5. the great momentum chase of 2024. the theme of the year was to just bid up and crowd into the most popular meme like line go up assets regardless of fundamentals. it went into over drive in november december to the point of self parody. it has a very end stage bull market feeling to it. 6. the great ai hype. does the potential future of ai justify many of these extreme valuations maybe but i m not convinced that there s much upside left near term. the only companies making serious money from this so far are nvidia and the handful of companies selling the ai hardware to other companies that are speculating on it. and the once rapid progression in generative ai chatbots picture generators and video generators seen in 2023 and early 2024 seems to have slowed and hit a bit of a wall in the second half of 2024. tl dr all the warning signs of extreme overvaluation and an incoming bear market are there. unlike most other gay bear posts that usually just show one warning sign chart to make a case i showed you multiple charts along with multiple observations. whether you choose to ignore them or not depends on how long you think the market will choose to ignore them or not. positions bent over a table. puts on tsla pltr mstr and some other 2024 momentum clown stocks for 2025. contemplating whether to inverse or to inverse my inverse. update 1 7 pre market i have taken down the screenshot of my tentative positions from 1 6 because i will be closing some of them and changing some things around. for archival purposes you may view my original 1 6 positions update 1 6 7 00pm est cramer on his closing segment on mad money just said i think palantir and tesla stock are definitely going higher. take that for what you will. i know the meme is to inverse cramer but he does end up being right short term a number of times so it doesn t really

are often the first to get cut. that can hurt growth and stock performance. 3. competitive pressure big fish like google can rapidly introduce competing solutions or restrict data access . 4. regulation privacy ongoing shifts in data privacy can reduce the effectiveness of targeted advertising. 6. valuation metrics to watch price to sales common for high growth tech stocks. compare apps to other adtech names . ev ebitda a measure of operational efficiency. useful if the company is ebitda positive. free cash flow indicates how well the business can fund growth and reduce debt. revenue guidance vs. actuals adtech names can be volatile around earnings. keep a close eye on how actual growth stacks up against management s forecast. 7. final thoughts digital turbine is a unique play in the adtech ecosystem due to its on device presence and broad approach to mobile monetization. the stock had a big run up in past years then pulled back amid overall adtech volatility and macro concerns. now it s in a period of potential consolidation and integration which could set the stage for a next leg of growth if execution is strong. dyor and consider your own risk tolerance. adtech can be a boom or bust sector heavily reliant on macroeconomic factors and consumer behavior. i m personally watching how the acquisitions pan out and whether management can smoothly integrate them to unlock meaningful synergies. what do you think share your thoughts in the comments. are you bullish bearish or on the fence with digital turbine any insights on the adtech landscape or personal experiences with their platform disclaimer i m not a financial advisor. this post is just my own research and perspective. always verify information with earnings reports 10 q 10 k filings and

well capitalized and management does not foresee the need to raise capital in 2025. in addition management does not feel the current share price fully reflects the value of its business. as a result realbotix will allocate a portion of its capital in q1 to its normal course issuer bid announced in october to buy back its common shares if they remain at current levels. at the current common share prices the company s cash and cash equivalents represents over 50 of its market capitalization. realbotix has a september financial year end and is currently finalizing its audited financial statements for 2024. it is anticipated that the company will release its audited statements approximately in the third week of january and within regulatory timelines. cryptocurrency treasury strategy

allow for opportunistic selling in anticipation of a further bullish pricing environment. in december realbotix sold 100 eth for working capital purposes. the company s remaining crypto holdings have appreciated by 173 since our previous fiscal year ended october 1st 2023. realbotix may explore additional purchases or sales of cryptocurrency. the company currently holds approximately 2880 eth alongside other digital assets and is owed approximately 10 333 sol and 84 eth from genesis. genesis has communicated to the company that further distributions will occur before the end of 2024.

gross value of approximately us$ 13.77m us$ 2.5m held at genesis or cdn$ 19.73m. as disclosed previously genesis global trading is undergoing a restructuring. as a result some of those holdings may not be recovered. we note these figures do not include realbotix s cash holdings. at current market values this represents over 50 of the company s market capitalization. 2025 robotic and ai marketing initiatives with the launch of the new consumer website realbotix.com the company enters 2025 with a focus on sales and marketing strategy. plans include hiring sales people and scaling operations to

strategy and growth potential. 1 t said tesla has a 200 trillion opportunity in front of it heres what it would take to get there our goal is to become a significant player in the humanoid robotics market. although the market and our products are at early stages our robots are available now for purchase said andrew kiguel ceo of realbotix. our next iteration of companionship and social ai is nearing completion. we believe our products have numerous use cases including tackling the loneliness epidemic which is estimated to impact as high as 50 of us citizens2 . as one of the only providers

other ai companies by offering deeply integrated hardware and software solutions that focus on human like connection creating what management believes to be the most realistic ai powered robots on the market. management intends to make further investments into marketing and sales with the goal of increasing its revenue pipeline. this would take the form of hiring additional sales support personnel and investing in further marketing such as attending trade shows and other forms of advertising. 2025 ai and hardware development the development of realbotix s next generation companionship ai remains a core focus with key partnerships driving progress. supported by compass and a grant from amazon web services the company is advancing its unique emotional ai platform which prioritizes unfiltered emotionally driven conversations over traditional task based ai models. additionally the robot controller 3.0 currently under development represents a large upgrade in the functionality and ai of realbotix s humanoid robotics. with improved motors speech capabilities it delivers high levels of fluidity and realism in movement. in addition it leverages our proprietary ai technologies to bring smarter more intuitive interactions to life setting new standards in robotic innovation. 2 domain name sales management plans to be more assertive in 2025 with respect to selling certain domain names including tokens.com. the tokens.com landing page has been converted to a sales site with that domain listed at us$6 million. management notes the domain is not valued on its balance sheet and

this is a deep dive into a a real sleeper enter beammwave who s innovation will likely underpin a great chunk of wireless communication in the future. this will be a lengthy one so hang on but what s five minutes of reading for early retirement in a couple of years eh ticker beammw.b or beammw b current price 5 25 sek $0.50 usd market cap $15.7m usd industry wireless communication the tl dr they have a technology that literally everyone in the mobile industry and beyond will need to be able to compete in the higher radio frequencies their solution is superior to anything out there today faster smaller and more energy efficient at an affordable price point competition to what they do is basically zero with extremely high barriers of entry due to a literal minefield of patents that they own their tech fits in smartphones routers base stations you name it it will fit they have the absolute dream team working on this applications range from mobile base stations cpe operators satellite self driving cars military radar etc. the possibilities are endless as long as data needs to be transmitted wirelessly this is a recipe for tsla levels of success. who are they beammwave is a swedish tech company developing and industrializing a technology called digital distributed beamforming which makes wireless data transfer significantly faster and more efficient and solves the looming issue of bandwidth running out on the frequencies in use today. it s the sorely missing key for the mobile industry to utilize higher radio frequencies at scale something all the big players are frothing at their mouths to get at. their key product is a compact and affordable chip system with fully integrated antennas enabling reliable wireless communication on the mmwave spectrum without the bulk and subpar performance of the solutions in use today. last summer they became the world first to showcase an over the air demo of digital distributed beamforming and having protected their solution with over 40 patents so far they aim to own the entire market ok apples to oranges since bluetooth is a protocol and distributed digital beamforming is a technical solution but the common factor is both represent a paradigm shift in the industry something that everyone will need to adopt to be competitive how are they pulling it off for being a small company in such a daunting industry they have some serious talent behind them the team consists of telecom industry og s several of them having held key roles in developing bluetooth in the 90 s and leading development of 5g at some of the biggest firms in the telecom industry one of their engineers holding over 2000 patents to his name alone. these guys garner a lot of respect in the industry and due to that they ve had access to discuss their idea with all the big players for years already. as the ceo stefan svedberg himself says everybody who s anybody in the industry knows who beammwave are and what they are working on. their personal merits have awarded them opportunities to work directly with chip manufacturers who normally don t do prototyping for small startups and gain access to special tooling and materials usually reserved for the big guys. they also have a company member inside the organization for mobile broadband network standarization 3gpp with significant influence there and they obviously aim to position digital distributed beamforming as the standard for mmwave operations in the future. simply put beammwave have positioned themselves as thought leaders when it comes to mmwave. the tech they own has sprung out of a decade of research at the university of lund and what speaks to their clout is they have been able to attract global talent from the likes of samsung huawei etc. to work for them instead. the exciting bit is nobody s really caught onto them outside the industry. yet. the geeky bits underpinning the value wireless communication is a massive market. the game has always been the same to get faster speeds more bandwdith and lower latency with less power consumption and at a cheaper price. data traffic s been increasing at breakneck speed through the adoption of smartphones developments in computing ai etc. to the point where current frequencies in use are simply running out of bandwidth. moving to higher frequencies what are called mmwave is unavoidable in order to solve the data bandwidth problem. the issue is once you go up in frequency the reach and penetration of radio waves diminish significantly. huge investments have been made into mmwave only for the tech to disappoint time after time to a point where the whole field has gotten a bit of a bad rep. this is because the industry has been trying to solve it the wrong way. the tech in use today is called analog beamforming the hardware is bulky expensive slow at catching a signal sensitive to spatial change needs an unobstructed line of sight and simply doesn t work well. from the beginning the founders of beammwave argued that analog beamforming was a stillborn idea it simply would not work in real life. they argued the intelligent way to do beamforming was digital and this is something everyone would agree on but the retort was it wouldn t be cheap enough. it wouldn t be energy efficient enough. it might just be impossible full stop. well turns out it wasn t. and nobody else was crazy enough to go for it. where are they at today since 2023 4 beammwave has been out of their research and development phase and are now selling their development platform called adp1 and are working with customers on projects that aim for production. according to the ceo they re on track to have a fully commercial product ready this year with production of scale ramping up in 2026. currently four major companies are working with them and evaluating their product 1. molex which is the second largest electronic connector company in the world 2. alpha networks with whom they are working on a fixed wireless access solution together 3. saab with whom they are working on innovations with military civilian synergies and 4. an as of yet undisclosed customer who has revealed they re an asian component manufacturer and industry leader in mmwave with over 70 000 employees and 10 billion usd in revenue. all the hints point toward murata manufacturing. in the event the rumors are correct i can t stress how huge that would be. it could imply that both apple and samsung are nibbling on beammwave s solution already since murata supplies them both. keep in mind beammwave are the only ones in the world with this kind of tech something everyone in the industry needs to be able to compete in the mmwave frequencies. and they ve protected their solution with over 40 patents so far and more incoming. it will be extremely difficult bordering impossible for anyone to bypass their intellectual property with a distributed digital beamforming solution no matter who you are. so what about the money in interviews the ceo stefan svedberg has repeatedly been asked to tease some numbers on how their revenues will scale but understandably he s been quite vague. his exact words from a few months back were that the numbers get pretty ridiculous pretty fast if you start to do math... but since i m not the ceo let me pull some numbers outta my ass anyway. current stock price is sitting around 0 50usd with a mkt cap of around 13 7 million at a 30 million share float. say beammwave chips get into 20 of the smartphones before 2030 around 300 million units per year. the estimate is they ll need 6 10 chips per unit at 1 2usd chip that s 6 20usd per device. revenue would be totalling 1 8 6 billion usd a year. let s lowball a p e of 5. that would mean a market cap of 9 30 billion usd in other words 300 1000 usd share at the current float. pwoah yeah that went apeshit pretty fast.. and that s only the mobile market. i won t pull any more numbers outta my ass but to me this is looking like one of the plays of the decade. why is the current valuation so low well personally i think they d already be due for a 10x with what they have so far but they are a very tech oriented company and what they do is very very complex. i don t think a lot of people understand the scope of their business case and they haven t been shouting about themselves from the rooftops either. there s no sexy one paragraph way of explaining the proposition. on top of that they re trading on the rather obscure nasdaq first north growth market and not many eyes have been on them so far. but once their stuff starts going to mass production oh boy. disclaimer not financial advice and am no expert on this whatsoever just trying to provide something of value for you guys instead of repeating the same pre mooned tickers that are on the front page over and over. do your own dd but if this thing hits don t forget the little guy when you re sipping cocktails on a beach somewhere. p.s. there are some really good company presentations where the ceo does a much better job of presenting than i ve done here are a couple of links to start you off disclosure i m balls deep into

[TITLE_END] so after travis kalanick got ousted dara khosrowshahi stepped in and turned uber from a wartime to a peacetime company. he cleaned up the culture mess shoved aside long term moonshots and put the company on a strict path to profitability . despite getting smacked by covid and high interest rates uber tightened its belt doubled down on demand supply matchmaking and came out profitable. wall street went nuts. uber is now fcf positive and aiming for even higher margins. so what is uber today dara says they re laser focused on nailing that perfect supply demand match. sure they re winning in mobility and they might tackle new verticals like fiverr style marketplaces. sounds great except they re missing out on the biggest opportunity of our era which is motherfucking ai. uber collects 11b trips a year from 160m users racking up insane amounts of data . this could ve made them a self driving powerhouse. but they ditched their autonomous unit in 2020 to cut costs just as nvidia s jensen huang now shows off new automotive processors and partnerships with toyota aurora and volvo. uber s name is nowhere on that list no matter how you spin it a simple supply demand marketplace could get overshadowed once autonomous vehicles go mainstream. especially when you already own the infrastructure for ride hailing food delivery scooters and bikes. investors might be licking their chops at two big plays 1. pull a reddit sell anonymized data for llm training and get lots of money further increasing margins. instantly uber gets an ai play. 2. sell to tesla or google supercharge someone else s av ambitions and get a fat premium in the process. meanwhile the stock still looks undervalued. uber s ltm p fcf is around 22.6x peg is under 1.0x and a reverse dcf suggests they only need 9.2 revenue growth over 10 years to justify the current price. that s totally doable. here s how i see it playing out 1. best case tesla or google acquires them this year and we get a solid premium payday. probably a stock deal but it s still peanuts compared to tesla and google market caps. 2. second best uber pivots to selling ai training data. 3. not bad either uber dominates more human driven marketplaces. 4. base scenario they stick to mobility keep expanding margins and maybe bolt on third party avs . what are your thoughts

months focusing instead on the windfall from president elect donald trump s promised tax cuts and the seemingly limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence. but the risk came into focus last week as treasury yields climbed toward their ominous milestones and share prices sank in response. the yield on 20 year us treasuries breached 5 on wednesday and jumped back above on friday reaching the highest since nov. 2 2023. meanwhile 30 year us treasuries briefly crossed 5 on friday to the highest since oct. 31 2023. those yields have risen roughly 100 basis points since mid september when the federal reserve started reducing the fed funds rate which has come down 100 basis points over the same time. it is unusual jeff blazek co cio of multi asset strategies at neuberger berman said of the dramatic and rapid jump in bond yields in the early months of an easing cycle. over the past 30 years intermediate and longer term yields have been relatively flat or modestly higher in the months after the fed initiated a string of rate cuts he added. traders are watching the policy sensitive 10 year treasury yield which is the highest it s been since october 2023 and is rapidly approaching 5 a level they fear could spark a stock market correction. it last passed the threshold briefly in october 2023 and before that you have to go back to july 2007. if the 10 year hits 5 there will be a knee jerk reaction to sell stocks said matt peron janus henderson s global head of solutions. episodes like this take weeks or maybe a few months to play out and over the course of that the s p 500 could get to down 10 . the reason is fairly simple. rising bond yields make returns on treasuries more attractive while also increasing the cost of raising capital for companies. the spillover into the stock market was apparent on friday as the s p 500 tumbled 1.5 for its worst day since mid december turned negative for 2025 and came close to wiping out all the gains from the november euphoria sparked by trump s election. while there s no magic to the fixation on 5 beyond round number psychology perceived barriers can create technical barriers said kristy akullian blackrock s head of ishares investment strategy. meaning a swift move in yields can make it difficult for stocks to rise. investors are already seeing how. the earnings yield for the s p 500 is sitting 1 percentage point below what s offered by 10 year treasuries a development last seen in 2002. in other words the return on owning a significantly less risky asset than the us equities benchmark hasn t been this good in a long time. once yields get higher it becomes harder and harder to rationalize valuation levels said mike reynolds vice president of investment strategy at glenmede trust. and if earnings growth starts to falter there can be issues. not surprisingly strategists and portfolio managers predict a bumpy road ahead for stocks. morgan stanley s mike wilson anticipates a tough six months for equities while citigroup s wealth division told clients there s a buying opportunity in bonds. the path to 5 on the 10 year treasury became more realistic on friday after strong jobs data caused economists to reduce expectations for rate cuts this year. but this isn t just about the fed. the selloff in bonds is global and based on sticky inflation hawkish central banks ballooning government debts and extreme uncertainties presented by the incoming trump administration. when you re in hostile waters yields above 5 is where all bets are off mark malek chief investment officer at siebert said. what equity investors need to know now is if and when serious buyers step in. the real question is where we go from there said rick de los reyes a portfolio manager at t. rowe price. if it s 5 on its way to 6 then that s going to get people concerned if it s 5 before stabilizing and ultimately going lower then things will be fine. red flags the key isn t so much that yields are rising but why market pros say. a slow increase as the us economy improves can help stocks. but a quick jump due to concerns about inflation the federal deficit and policy uncertainty is a red flag. in recent years whenever yields have risen quickly stocks have sold off. the difference this time appears to be complacent investors as seen in bullish positioning in the face of frothy valuations and uncertainties about trump s policies. and that s putting equities in a vulnerable position. when you look at rising prices a strong job market and an overall strong economy it all points to a possible uptick in inflation said eric diton president of the wealth alliance. and that s not even including trump s policies. one area that may prove to be a haven for equity investors is the group that s been driving most of the gains these past few years big tech. the so called magnificent seven companies alphabet inc. amazon.com inc. apple inc. meta platforms inc. microsoft corp. nvidia corp. and tesla inc. are still posting rapid earnings growth and massive cash flows. plus looking to the future they re expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence revolution. investors typically seek high quality stocks with strong balance sheets and strong cash flows during market turmoil said eric sterner chief investment officer at apollon wealth. the mega techs have become part of that defensive play recently. that s the hope many equity investors are hanging on that mega cap tech companies sway over the broader market and their relative security will limit any weakness in the stock market. the magnificent seven have a more than 30 weighting in the s p 500. at the same time the fed is in the midst of lowering interest rates although the pace is likely going to be slower than expected. that makes this a very different situation than 2022 when the fed was hiking rates rapidly and indexes plunged. still many wall street pros are urging investors to proceed cautiously for the time being as rate risk hits in various unexpected ways. the companies in the s p 500 that are up the most will probably be the most vulnerable and that could include the mag seven and some frothy areas of mid cap and small cap growth will likely be under pressure said janus henderson s peron. we ve been consistent across our firm on staying focused on quality and being valuation sensitive. that will be very important in the coming months.

what s offered by 10 year treasuries a development last seen in 2002. in other words the return on owning a significantly less risky asset than the us equities benchmark hasn t been this good in a long time. once yields get higher it becomes harder and harder to rationalize valuation levels said mike reynolds vice president of investment strategy at glenmede trust. and if earnings growth starts to falter there can be issues. not surprisingly strategists and portfolio managers predict a bumpy road ahead for stocks. morgan stanley s mike wilson anticipates a tough six months for equities while citigroup s wealth division told clients there s a buying opportunity in bonds. the path to 5 on the 10 year treasury became more realistic on friday after strong jobs data caused economists to reduce expectations for rate cuts this year. but this isn t just about the fed. the selloff in bonds is global and based on sticky inflation hawkish central banks ballooning government debts and extreme uncertainties presented by the incoming trump administration. when you re in hostile waters yields above 5 is where all bets are off mark malek chief investment officer at siebert said. what equity investors need to know now is if and when serious buyers step in. the real question is where we go from there said rick de los reyes a portfolio manager at t. rowe price. if it s 5 on its way to 6 then that s going to get people concerned if it s 5 before stabilizing and ultimately going lower then things will be fine. red flags the key isn t so much that yields are rising but why market pros say. a slow increase as the us economy improves can help stocks. but a quick jump due to concerns about inflation the federal deficit and policy uncertainty is a red flag. in recent years whenever yields have risen quickly stocks have sold off. the difference this time appears to be complacent investors as seen in bullish positioning in the face of frothy valuations and uncertainties about trump s policies. and that s putting equities in a vulnerable position. when you look at rising prices a strong job market and an overall strong economy it all points to a possible uptick in inflation said eric diton president of the wealth alliance. and that s not even including trump s policies. one area that may prove to be a haven for equity investors is the group that s been driving most of the gains these past few years big tech. the so called magnificent seven companies alphabet inc. amazon.com inc. apple inc. meta platforms inc. microsoft corp. nvidia corp. and tesla inc. are still posting rapid earnings growth and massive cash flows. plus looking to the future they re expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence revolution. investors typically seek high quality stocks with strong balance sheets and strong cash flows during market turmoil said eric sterner chief investment officer at apollon wealth. the mega techs have become part of that defensive play recently. that s the hope many equity investors are hanging on that mega cap tech companies sway over the broader market and their relative security will limit any weakness in the stock market. the magnificent seven have a more than 30 weighting in the s p 500. at the same time the fed is in the midst of lowering interest rates although the pace is likely going to be slower than expected. that makes this a very different situation than 2022 when the fed was hiking rates rapidly and indexes plunged. still many wall street pros are urging investors to proceed cautiously for the time being as rate risk hits in various unexpected ways. the companies in the s p 500 that are up the most will probably be the most vulnerable and that could include the mag seven and some frothy areas of mid cap and small cap growth will likely be under pressure said janus henderson s peron. we ve been consistent across our firm on staying focused on quality and being valuation sensitive. that will be very important in the coming months.

contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the us supreme court. but the justices signaled during arguments on jan. 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. senior chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for tiktok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with donald trump s administration one of which involves musk said the people asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions. a potential high profile deal with one of trump s closest allies holds some appeal for the chinese government which is expected to have some say over whether tiktok

takes office. under one scenario that s been discussed by the chinese government musk s x the former twitter would take control of tiktok us and run the businesses together the people said. with more

will face tough negotiations with the trump administration over tariffs export controls and other issues and they see the tiktok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation they said. the chinese government holds a so called golden share in a bytedance affiliate that gives it influence over the company s strategy and operations. tiktok maintains that the control only applies to the china based subsidiary douyin information service co. and has no bearing on bytedance operations outside china. still beijing s export rules prevent chinese companies from selling their software algorithms like the one integral to tiktok. because the chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes tiktok s valuable recommendation engine it has a significant voice in any possible deal. tiktok s us operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion bloomberg intelligence analysts mandeep singh and damian reimertz estimated last year. that s a substantial

seen as a very successful entrepreneur who has experience engaging with the chinese government through his tesla inc. business the person added. bytedance s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight us legislation that requires the beijing based company sell or shut down the us operations because of national security concerns. tiktok s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the constitution s first amendment. a majority of the supreme court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech although they have yet to issue a formal decision. president elect trump who takes office jan. 20 has sought to delay the tiktok ban which takes effect jan. 19 so he can work on the negotiations. he has said he wants to save the app and there s been speculation he could take last minute action to sidestep the ban. on a practical level spinning off tiktok s us business would be highly complex affecting shareholders in china as well as the us. lawyers for tiktok argued before the supreme court that separating the us portions of the product would be extraordinarily difficult. it s unclear if us tiktok would be sold off in a competitive process or if a sale would be arranged by the government. billionaire frank mccourt and shark tank investor kevin o leary are part of a bid through project liberty to acquire tiktok which o leary has said he discussed with trump. in the past microsoft corp. had sought to acquire the business and oracle corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company. one alternative for tiktok

2025-01-16,2025-01-16 00:20:25,TSLA,Tesla,trading,i asked ai to build the best trading strategy i asked ai to build the best trading strategy [TITLE_END] so i recently asked chad geepeetee to create the ultimate trading strategy. i told it to think really outside of the box and run troubleshooting and refinement iterations about 30 times. here s the strategy it generated. the quantum flux edge strategy the idea behind this strategy is that markets are like particles in quantum mechanics constantly fluctuating between states of order and chaos. the strategy works by exploiting flux zones which are areas of transition between calm and volatile price action. the rules 1. identify the flux zone use a 3 line ema cloud to identify the market flux. a flux zone occurs when the emas converge within a range of 5 of the asset s average daily range . 2. quantum state confirmation overlay a custom oscillator called the quantum flow index . it s basically rsi bollinger bands a noise filter from heikin ashi candles. when the qfi crosses above 55 in a flux zone it signals that the market is moving into a state of order. below 45 indicates chaos. 3. entry signals enter a long trade when the price breaks out of the flux zone upward with at least a 1.5x atr candle. the qfi is above 55 and rising. the volume on the breakout is 20 above the 10 day moving average. enter a short trade when the price breaks below the flux zone with the same conditions reversed. 4. profit targets and stops target use fibonacci extensions of 1.618 from the flux zone range for exits. stop place stops just outside the flux zone. 5. the entropy spike filter this is the unique part before any trade check for an entropy spike which occurs when the qfi diverges from price direction for more than 3 consecutive bars. if it happens no trade it means the market s quantum state is unpredictable. i backtested it on eur usd btc usd and tsla just for fun. the win rate was 48 but the r r was always 1 3 or better so it was tehcnically profitable. but who knows if this will hold up live. gonna test it on real price action for a month and let ya know the results.

consider it [TITLE_END] the woes of speaker maker sonos have raised the prospect of a takeover but who might want to buy it for months sonos inc. has been reeling. after a disastrous software rollout last year the audio technology company that some used to call the apple of speakers remains mired in the biggest crisis in its two decade history. it all started in may when the company introduced a revamped app the software that lets customers control their speakers soundbars subwoofers headphones and other devices. the app was designed to modernize the sonos experience and lay the groundwork for new types of products such as the ace headphones. but it lacked vital features and was hobbled by bugs turning the simple act of using sonos equipment into a nightmare. the missing features including the sleep timer advanced music queues alarms and functions related to searching and navigating music libraries have mostly been restored. but users have reported that glitches persist in some cases devices don t pair audio volume will spike without warning connections fail and streaming doesn t always go smoothly. sonos should have never launched the new app the way it did and was aware of many bugs prior to the initial release. it should have kept around the old and reliable s2 app and launched the new version as a beta test. once the revamped software became as dependable as the old app sonos could have moved forward with the new version as the default. of course that would have provided less of a splashy marketing opportunity the chance to flip the switch on a whole new experience. so here we are. the new app ended up being devastating to employee morale company revenue and the brand s reputation. it s a disaster on par with apple s rocky move to its own maps software from google in 2012 a switch that led to the ouster of the company s software chief. the big difference is that for apple maps is one app. for sonos the change compromised the software underpinning all its products. sonos board ultimately needed to take action. more than six months after the launch of the app and even after an apology tour from its executives and a multitude of attempted fixes the company parted ways with chief executive officer patrick spence a week ago. the next day it also cut loose its chief product officer who many sonos employees blamed for the app mess. in their place is interim ceo tom conrad a co creator of music streaming service pandora and former executive at snap inc. he has served on the sonos board since 2017 and was already helping with the app recovery effort. though the company has vowed to search the globe for a new full time ceo many sonos staffers believe conrad has the inside track to get the job if he wants it. but with sonos market valuation hovering around $1.7 billion down from more than $5 billion during a pandemic fueled rally the board will probably consider whether selling the company makes more sense. apple has long been seen as a potential suitor given the two companies similarities. sonos is focused on premium design with a tightly controlled ecosystem just like apple. they share a penchant for audio technology and their corporate cultures have some overlap. apple could snap up sonos for $2 billion or so less than it paid for beats and it would only cost them a few days worth of revenue. sonos hardware could also shore up apple s disappointing homepod and home audio lineup. but i don t believe apple will ever acquire sonos. if apple really wanted to build out its home audio business it already has the hardware software content and manufacturing chops internally. it s just about wanting to get things done properly something that apple is already working on. later this year it will launch its own home hub and a new homepod mini. the only things it would gain from sonos are a user base a collection of patents and the employees none of which apple needs. sonos software is obviously something apple wouldn t want especially in its current state and audio hardware has become heavily commoditized. other potential suitors such as meta platforms inc. alphabet inc. s google and microsoft corp. wouldn t make much sense either. meta has all but exited the smart home choosing to focus on ai and wearables instead. google has a painful history with sonos involving patent lawsuits. and microsoft has increasingly scaled back its interest in non xbox hardware in recent years. still there are some major technology companies that might consider the idea. that list includes inc. samsung electronics co. roku inc. and spotify technology sa. amazon seems like the most natural fit. with former microsoft chief product officer panos panay now leading its hardware efforts the expectation is that amazon will revamp its device lineup and shift toward more upscale offerings. sonos speakers already work with the entire streaming music industry and are certainly high end. sonos premium technology could be the basis for a series of new amazon echo devices running the upcoming ai infused alexa digital assistant. it would also help amazon expand into new areas such as over ear headphones and soundbars two categories the company has explored in the past. amazon could certainly afford to buy sonos though it would have to overcome regulatory hurdles. don t forget amazon had to back out of a deal to buy roomba maker irobot corp. after the european union threatened to block the acquisition. a european company like spotify might have an easier time getting a deal cleared. the streaming music service has championed the idea of hardware products that can run services from several different players which sonos does well. spotify has long wanted to get into hardware but struggled to make it happen. sonos would give them an instant entry with an excellent range of products that could run its audio services. roku is another possibility though it would probably face antitrust concerns. after all the company already sells a set of low end soundbars and tv speakers. if it could make a deal work roku would get higher end products that can potentially command higher profit margins. one caveat this may need to be a stock based deal given roku doesn t have as much cash on hand as its bigger rivals. samsung is a wild card. the company already sells soundbars and subwoofers and even acquired the harman brand in 2017. but it s failed to crack the home speaker space. it announced an echo like speaker called the galaxy home several years ago but never actually brought it to market. sonos would help it create a more consumer focused line of home audio gear and provide more modern technology for its home theater products. for consumers the best scenario is probably sonos figuring things out and remaining independent the current goal of the company. with the world s biggest tech giants expanding into every facet of our lives there is something appealing about an independent brand that plays nice with all the platforms. it s just unclear how long sonos will be able to do it alone. retail inventory of the current iphone se quickly shrinks ahead of new model s debut. one of apple s most significant new products this year will be the the iphone se s replacement. the device codenamed v59 will mark the beginning of apple s transition from qualcomm inc. cellular modem chips to silicon designed in house. it also means the company will no longer sell an iphone with the now antiquated home button. the latest model which will also add apple intelligence is set to launch by the spring and there are signs apple is gearing up for the release. according to people working in apple s retail operations a surprisingly large number of us stores have little to no inventory of the iphone se remaining. consumers can still get the device from the online store and it ships out within a few days but finding one at a brick and mortar outlet is going to be harder and harder. apple also has ceased sales of the current se in the european union because the device lacks the now required usb c port. the drawing down of inventory is a reliable sign that a new model is coming. but it also suggests that apple probably won t keep the current version around at a reduced price after the update is here. that seems like a missed opportunity since a cheap iphone could ve helped apple make inroads in some markets. the current se costs $429 and the new one might be more than that given its enhanced features. this new iphone isn t the only big product update on the horizon. as i wrote last week look out for upcoming macbook airs with the m4 donan chip as well as fresh low end ipads ipad airs and new magic keyboards in the not too distant future. apple is bringing ai to mac mail app in macos 15.4 even as it scales back notification summaries in ios 18.3. the apple intelligence rollout is continuing with the release of macos 15.3 in a few weeks. for the first time apple is bringing its genmoji custom emoji to the mac following their debut on the iphone and ipad. the company will add more features by april with ios 18.4 and macos 15.4. the big addition at that time will be the new siri digital assistant which will be able to better tap into personal information and use the app intents technology to more precisely control apps. but there s another more under the radar feature coming in april as well the mac will get the upgraded mail app that uses ai to prioritize messages and sort content into different inboxes. right now ipad and iphone users are able to tap into the feature which is terrific but mac customers have been left behind. that changes with macos 15.4 i m told. for those not familiar with the feature it sorts mail into a primary category as well as ones for transactions promotions updates and all mail. in other apple intelligence news the company is scaling back notification summaries in ios 18.3 and macos 15.3. for months news organizations and users have been complaining about incorrect or misleading notifications from apple intelligence. rather than quickly fixing its ai models apple is simply pulling the plug on summaries from news and entertainment apps. you can also more easily disable summaries from the lock screen and recaps are now italicized. apple s ex chief people officer lands at hp. it s not easy to join apple after a career outside the company. the place is run by big personalities like tim cook phil schiller greg joswiak and others who have been there for several decades. in other words if you re walking into apple thinking you re going to change how it operates you re in for a surprise. that was the case with carol surface who joined apple in 2023 as chief people officer after working at medtronic plc best buy co. and pepsico inc. she flamed out after less than two years. stella low apple s short lived vice president of communications ran into similar issues in 2022. both women were hired by cook himself and stayed at apple for way less time than anticipated but now they have another thing in common they landed at hp inc. afterward. low joined the computer maker as its chief communications officer in 2022 and recently left. surface just agreed to join hp and is starting march 24. given surface s successful and varied human resources career prior to apple she could end up being a good fit for hp. speaking of apple s insidery culture it was no surprise that surface s role was ultimately filled by deirdre o brien her predecessor and a 30 plus year veteran of the company. low meanwhile was replaced by kristin huguet a member of apple s pr department since before the original iphone went on sale. they re both capable leaders but apple will eventually need to figure out how to bring in more talent from the outside. right now the company isn t always built to handle fresh ideas from newcomers. with apple s need to innovate and find new sources of revenue that might be a problem in the not too distant future. the schedule jan. 22 samsung unveils galaxy s25 line. samsung is set to announce its galaxy s25 smartphone lineup at its unpacked event this week in san jose california. this year s devices aren t expected to get a major hardware overhaul with the company instead focusing more on software and artificial intelligence features. but samsung aims to show that it has an edge over apple in this area. stay tuned for coverage of unpacked this week including all of the details of the new devices. and if you re waiting for news on samsung smartwatches and foldable phones those will likely debut later in the year. jan. 30 apple s first quarter results. the earnings report the first under chief financial officer kevan parekh will give details of apple s all important holiday season. investors will get an idea of how the iphone 16 is selling as well as updated airpods and apple watches. the company also should provide the first real sense of whether the apple intelligence ai platform is spurring consumers to upgrade their devices. wall street is looking for about $124 billion in revenue during the period a 4 gain from a year earlier. post game q a q why is tim cook attending the trump inauguration a many apple employees are none too pleased that their ceo is heading to washington to kiss the ring and attend trump s swearing in event on monday. the move seems to clash with apple s support of diversity immigration and other progressive causes ones that cook himself has championed. but it s equally clear that apple may need trump s help over the next four years as it contends with tariffs the justice department antitrust case and mounting pressure from the european union. cook likely believes trump can alleviate these problems. he s also not alone in turning out for the president elect. most of the world s most valuable tech companies are sending a high profile leader to the event. q when are the new powerbeats pro 2 launching a the latest earbuds from apple s beats subsidiary are due imminently. the new accessory has already been submitted to the federal communications commission and other regulators for approval and the company is gearing up for a press briefing in a week or so to go over the details of the new product. the upgrades will feature a smaller overall design and improvements like spatial audio and enhanced noise cancellation that are already available on airpods. the programming code within ios also suggests that these earbuds could be capable of collecting heart rate data from a wearer. i ve previously reported that apple is working on this technology and actively testing it. q why is apple starting to use us made chips a a major under discussed risk facing apple right now is that practically 100 of its advanced processors are made in taiwan by partner tsmc. if taiwan goes down for whatever reason apple is in big trouble with no real plan b. that s why moving more production to other areas is so critical and such a shift is now underway. tsmc is running test production of lower end apple chips at a facility in arizona the first step toward more ambitious goals. over time apple hopes to get chips from other factories in the us and elsewhere including europe. let s face it the company has been fairly lucky so far that its chip production hasn t suffered major hiccups. apple s reliance on one geographic location for the most important component in its devices has been a major hazard for years. link

2025-01-21,2025-01-21 14:26:39,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,xpel analyzing growth potential in the automotive market xpel analyzing growth potential in the automotive market [TITLE_END] here s my condensed analysis of xpel fyi i focus on uncovering companies with strong growth potential and sharing my insights. note all hyperlinks will lead you to direct source material disclaimer i do not own shares of xpel at the time of writing i would love to hear from the community and have a in depth conversation from ya ll. thank you enjoy macro overview electric vehicle growth the u.s. ev market is projected to show annual growth of 10.54 from 2025 2029 resulting in a market value of $156.3 billion by 2029 unit sales alone are projected to reach 2.32 million units by 2029 as well. consumers now have significantly more choices when shopping for an electric vehicle. they can choose from offerings by hyundai and many others. ev s often have unique aesthetic and maintenance needs that typically have high quality protective films and coatings. the growth in consumer adoption of ev s coincides with xpel products particularly on the impact in the aftermarket. ev owners value vehicle preservation. this creates a growing market share for xpel s products. these products also include heat reducing window films that indirectly enhance battery performance. aging vehicles the average car or truck on the road in the u.s in 2024 was more than 12.6 years old a new record according to consumers now choose to keep cars longer than they used to. this is largely because of the increases in new vehicle prices. as these older vehicles age the demand for general maintenance and preservation are more likely to rise. car price increases have climbed for four consecutive months according to as of december 2024 the average price of a new vehicle was $49 740 the second highest level ever recorded. economic uncertainty and higher costs can discourage new purchases. this situation favors repairs and maintenance of existing vehicles as the fleet continues to get older before replacement. technological advancements from xpel and competitors and were released much earlier. they have recently gained traction as consumers want paint protection film to protect their vehicles. self healing films use polymer capable of automatically repairing minor scratches and abrasions when exposed to heat. as vehicles on the road become increasingly older the demand for reduced effort in maintaining a vehicle s exterior will increase. vehicle owners will likely seek easier maintenance solutions with minimal effort that repel against water dirt and scratches more easily. consumers and manufacturers are increasingly adopting self healing films. people who want to protect their older vehicles find xpel appealing. it is also chosen to keep luxury cars in pristine condition. investment thesis xpel is a compelling investment with an attractive growth story in the automotive sector. it is supported by a strong brand presence international expansion growth and financial strength. with high expectations investors should take notice in the premium valuation risks apparent. long term growth is certainly compelling but there are clear short term headwinds including macroeconomic uncertainties that require careful monitoring. product diversification xpel is widely known for their paint protection films. these films contribute to 70 of total q3 sales and grew by 2.7 . still products like their window film and ceramic coatings have outperformed with growth of 20.6 . like home office window films antimicrobial film and niche surface protection film also out performed by 11.6 . together both segments contributed 30 to total sales. impressive growth outperformance though has largely been a significant reason for overall revenue growth in recent quarters. international expansion u.s. sales are the largest contributor to total revenue accounting for 57.2 of the total and reaching $64.6 million in q3 reflecting year over year growth of 9.4 . despite the reliance on u.s. sales international sales continue to outperform. canada is the second largest contributor at 12.8 of revenue with growth of 25.7 to $14.4 million. all international markets saw growth except for the third largest market which is china. china saw a significant decline of 11.6 to just $9.06 million. the decrease was primarily attributed to xpel s distributor working through excess inventory levels. with only a weighting of 8 of total sales the negative growth did not hurt overall sales significantly. while xpel faced challenges in china as well as minor growth of 4.1 and 1.4 in europe and the u.k strong international performance lead to record revenue. strategic partnerships xpel has established multiple strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. recent collaborations with brands like exclusive supplier partnership and have been formed. these collaborations including with service providers like have strengthened market presence. brand visibility and revenue growth have also increased as a result. the tesla partnership in particular is of major importance due to their dominance in the ev market. these recent collaborations integrate xpel s wide array of products into solutions for high profile vehicles and events. the partnerships with tesla and rivian are particularly significant. they expand their reach into the electric vehicle market that continues to rapidly grow in the u.s. and internationally. risk factors reliance on chinese distribution from a new administration will significantly impact xpel if enacted. if new tariffs are applied xpel will be faced with increases in far materials leading to higher production costs. with the u.s market as the largest source of revenue at 57.2 passing on further costs to consumers would likely reduce demand. most importantly reliance on one distributor could lead to supply chain constraints due to an over reliance on one company. price increases or delayed deliveries would harm relationships and hurt xpel s brand. the culper research short report on october 19 2023 sending xpel s stock retreating 17.3 from $51.51 per share to $42.61. a notable accusation was xpel s understated reliance on tesla. by stating tesla represented just 5 of 2023 revenue. secondly culper believes xpel is concealing a massive risk. their primary supplier entrotech inc has formed a on may 23 2023. lastly culper s claim as seen below would have massive repercussions for xpel if they are correct. additional culper info the validity of culper s claims on xpel and others have been for self benefiting public statements. what we do know for sure is the joint venture with ppg industries is in fact truthful. the extent of which xpel will become obsolete on the other is a highly questionable take. for some reason culper did not mention that xpel stands out due to their dap software. it is not because of the ppf raw material. hence xpel would know exactly how much material and company their products were installed on. these allegations were made in 2023. xpel has continued to show strong growth. the company has not skipped a beat. conclusion xpel offers an attractive growth story in the automotive industry. this growth is supported by their strong market position and international expansion. the company also has a diverse product portfolio and strategic partnerships. a p e ratio of 23.98 certainly wouldn t be viewed as cheap by any measures. still their p e is significantly below their five year average p e of 41.6. long term growth remains compelling with the expectation of double digit growth in the next two years. nonetheless there are near term headwinds. sure xpel has displayed a history of growth but near term macroeconomic uncertainties regarding tariff concerns are worth monitoring. xpel must consider how to react to such challenges since their distributor is based in china. for the reasons noted above we still believe xpel is a compelling buy. it offers long term sustainable growth strategic partnerships international expansion and a strong balance sheet.

2025-01-24,2025-01-24 18:45:49,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,$500b stargate ai project what sectors and stocks could win big $500b stargate ai project what sectors and stocks could win big [TITLE_END] so the $500 billion stargate ai project was just announced and honestly that s a huge amount of money being thrown into ai and related tech. it s got me thinking what sectors and companies could ride this wave in the near future if history tells us anything investments of this scale tend to shake up entire industries with both big names and under the radar players benefiting. let s break it down by sector because there s a lot to unpack here 1. semiconductors the brains behind ai ai doesn t run without hardware and semiconductors are at the heart of it all. gpus cpus and those fancy ai specialized chips are the foundation of machine learning. companies like nvidia amd and intel are already dominating this space and i wouldn t be surprised if they see even more demand. nvidia especially is practically the poster child for ai hardware. their growth has been insane and a project of this magnitude could push it even further. expect ai chips to continue driving their revenue in the coming years. 2. cloud computing data centers ai projects need a ton of computing power and storage. that s where the big cloud providers aws microsoft azure and google cloud come in. these companies are likely already gearing up to grab their slice of the stargate pie. then you ve got data center companies like equinix and digital realty trust which could also benefit. all this ai data has to live somewhere and these companies provide the backbone for hosting it. 3. ai software players it s not just about the hardware companies building the actual ai tools and software are in a great spot too. think palantir c3.ai and snowflake. these players already help businesses make sense of their data and implement ai driven solutions so they could see a major surge in demand. the rise of ai as a service could also give these companies a big boost as the stargate project moves forward. 4. startups the dark horses this is where things get really interesting. while the big names are obvious winners startups working on niche ai applications could also see some major growth. some of these smaller companies aren t on anyone s radar right now but they could pop up as key players or even get acquired by the bigger guys. if you re into high risk high reward opportunities this might be where you want to look. 5. telecom networking supporting the ai boom ai depends on fast low latency networks to transfer data efficiently. that s why telecom and networking companies are probably smiling right now. companies like cisco juniper networks and even those working on 5g infrastructure could benefit. after all all that ai data has to move through fast reliable connections and these are the folks making that possible. 6. autonomous tech evs this one s a bit of a wildcard but it makes sense. companies like tesla waymo and mobileye that are working on self driving cars and autonomous tech could see a boost. ai is critical for advancing self driving capabilities and a major investment like this might accelerate developments in the space. 7. cybersecurity as ai adoption grows so do concerns around data privacy and security. cybersecurity companies like crowdstrike palo alto networks and zscaler could also be beneficiaries. protecting sensitive ai systems and the data they process is going to be a top priority. so what do you all think are there other sectors or companies that might benefit any smaller names worth keeping an eye on let s discuss

[TITLE_END] the great american company is trading at a all time high but is facing a lot of headwinds in 2025. 1 tarriffs deere made the mistake of outsourcing their production outside the us and will pay the price with the new administration. they recently announced they were moving production to mexico for some of the equipment manufacturing which lead to a boycott by farmers and a threat of 200 tariff if they do which wont happen because you cant really impose this tax on a specific company. but this was a mistake by the company because now they spent all this money to setup the factories and production in mexico but cant really use it as intended. they also made the mistake of outsourcing tractor production to india. a good amount of production is outside the us meaning tractors are assembled in india europe and elsewhere and sent to the us for sale. which is a problem because these are not cheap tractors equipment and someone is going to pay the tariff on foreign goods entering the united states. not that easy to readjust the whole supply chain back to the us and having to pay people alot more money. average worker in india makes $5k per year in the us these manufacturing jobs will cost maybe $50k $80k per year. profit margins just got smaller. then there is the us manufacturing exports. deere exports alot of their products to other countries not all customers are in the us. if we impose tariffs on lets say german cars coming into the us they will 100 in retaliation impose tariffs on us cars heavy equipment and farm equipment being sent into europe south america china etc. deere isnt the only manufacturer of tractors and farm equipment you have a lot of manufacturers around the world. people are just going to buy cheaper domestic products. 2 rumored pick up truck there s been a rumor going around they are planning to launch a pick up truck. i think this would be a costly mistake and they just wouldn t be able to compete with the best selling pickup in the world the f 150. car manufacturing is very expensive as elon has stressed multiple times ramping up production costs alot of money and might not be worth the effort especially if it flops. there is just too much competition is the space between toyota ford general motors tesla rivian nissan dodge. 3 ftc sues deere for farmers right to repair the complaint this unfair steering practice has boosted deere s multi billion dollar profits on agricultural equipment and parts growing its repair parts business while burdening farmers with higher repair costs the ftc s complaint alleges. i dont think this ftc suit is going away the current administration will 100 stand behind the hard working farmers that feed america. 62 of revenue comes from agriculture equipment and 13 comes from financial services. farmers are using deere financing to repair deere equipment its 100 a monopoly. between decreasing revenue sales higher labor cost higher production costs and increased competition this company has quite a few challenges to work through this year.

2025-01-26,2025-01-26 19:27:18,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",stocks,apple remains a threat in ar even as meta and google race ahead apple remains a threat in ar even as meta and google race ahead [TITLE_END] meta and google have jumped out ahead in the race to make augmented reality glasses for consumers but apple remains a looming threat. also the iphone maker brings in a fixer for its siri and ai efforts and the company has a decision to make about its longtime chairman. samsung meanwhile just unveiled impressive new ai features and is poised to beat apple to market with a skinny smartphone. a decade ago it began developing ar technology for its now defunct attempt to build a self driving vehicle. the idea a windshield that could overlay navigation information traffic alerts camera feeds and other data while the car drove around town on its own. apple even built a simulator of the concept at its silicon valley offices and managed to turn the idea into a working prototype that showed promise to executives. but the company quickly realized that this minority report like experience would be too power hungry and expensive to put inside of a vehicle. so it turned its attention to headsets which can provide the same data in a smaller package. a person in the car could simply wear some headgear instead of needing to have the technology built into the windshield. the car glasses idea didn t get too far either. but apple s vehicle group poured resources into developing ar displays and used virtual reality goggles to demonstrate the car s capabilities. that ultimately led to apple s work on a consumer headset. at the time chief executive officer tim cook felt that vr goggles were too isolating. he preferred ar which keeps users in the real world while superimposing data on their field of vision. but it was also clear that the true ar dream a lightweight pair of glasses that customers could wear all day was still far off. that s about the time when mike rockwell stepped in. that executive who currently oversees apple s vision pro division moved the ar and vr efforts into a team that was separate from the car unit. rockwell and his staff spent the better part of two years creating a headset prototype that melded vr and ar into an approach that apple eventually called spatial computing. this was the great compromise users weren t truly seeing the real world around them but the device s pass through cameras made it feel like they were. the project was greenlit and the company eventually spent billions of dollars to develop the device all while continuing to work on making true ar glasses a reality. that led to the release of the vision pro mixed reality headset a year ago. apple had originally hoped to release ar spectacles as a follow up to the vision pro but the technical challenges were just too great. such a product remains far away and the company is still tinkering with the underlying technologies. at the same time rivals like meta platforms inc. and alphabet inc. s google have jumped ahead in the ar race. meta showed off a prototype of augmented reality glasses last year and google is working with samsung electronics co. on their own next generation devices. meta also has had success with its ray ban smart glasses which don t have a display but can handle tasks like recording video and making phone calls. the vision pro meanwhile has largely been a flop hurt by its cumbersome design and $3 500 price tag. that said it s hard to discount apple s innovation abilities. work on the ar screens remains ongoing at a secretive facility in santa clara california one town over from the company s home base in cupertino. though there were layoffs at the site last year when apple scrapped plans for in house smartwatch displays the company kept some employees around to work on ar technology along with a manufacturing facility to develop and test future screens. tepid demand for the vision pro has only made apple more certain that ar glasses are a superior format. but the executives involved in the effort don t think a product will be ready for three years or more. in the meantime apple expects to release other devices in the style of vision pro that it hopes will be cheaper and more enticing to consumers. while it develops the ar technology for future devices the company is conducting user studies at its offices to gauge the appeal of features and interfaces. apple is already working on a version of visionos the vision pro s software that will run on glasses. it s also exploring other types of wearable products including a rival to meta s ray ban spectacles and even camera equipped airpods. the question now is whether apple s rivals are getting too far ahead. meta s ar prototype called orion will set the stage for a consumer product by 2027. and google s new android xr operating system is meant to usher in a wave of headsets and glasses with samsung first in line to release devices. when i first tested android xr in december at google s headquarters the company showed me several glasses prototypes with and without displays. they seemed polished for prototypes but they won t hit the market until the display technology improves and costs come down. another issue to be solved battery life. meta google and samsung also aren t slowing down on development of vr and mixed reality devices. meta is working on quest 4 vr goggles as well as a new high end model that could eventually become a successor to the quest pro mixed reality headset i m told. samsung meanwhile showed off the hardware for its moohan mixed reality headset during its unpacked event this past week. in interviews samsung and google executives hinted that this headset would be cheaper than the vision pro and that it s on track to debut this year. the companies won t have to share the spotlight with apple which is unlikely to ship any major new head worn device in 2025. but the real showdown will come in the years ahead when ar glasses are refined enough to serve as a smartphone replacement. you can imagine a future where people use smart spectacles as their primary mobile device and then turn to a mixed reality or vr headset for gaming or computing tasks. in that vision head worn devices will have supplanted both phones and laptops markets worth hundreds of billions of dollars. given what s at stake apple can t afford to stay on the sidelines too long. but the company does have a history of swooping into already established markets and beating competitors with better design and more elegantly integrated hardware and software. the playbook it used so effectively in smartphones and watches could work again. link

2025-01-27,2025-01-27 13:06:13,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,the case for tsla the business value the case for tsla the business value [TITLE_END] many people consider tsla to be overvalued based on fundamentals. make no mistake it absolutely is... based on fundamentals. the value of tsla beyond the twitter political volatility comes from its proven track record in achieving the impossible. breaking into an otherwise unbreakable car market how many new western car companies can you recall successfully breaking into the market in the last few decades the only real answer is tsla. everything else is bleeding money a penny stock or a youtube car review channel side quest. popularizing an otherwise undesirable and impossible product before the ev boom any consideration of a successful ev business would be immediately countered with legitimate concerns. the car community wouldn t be very excited without their loud 4l v8 engines. the product would be impossible to make as the batteries would be expensive heavy unreliable and yield a low driving range. if you did get an ev you wouldn t be able to charge it since there were no charger networks. not to mention the expected environmental returns from selling evs but generally disrupting the market and directing it towards sustainable energy cars. i love my fuel hungry loud 6 cylinder german beast but ice engines in the mainstream have an expiration date and will eventually become a niche when the larger market transitions to evs. tsla takes the credit for this singlehandedly. everybody else follows. scaling up actually selling cars tesla is ev sales and is in the of all car sales. meanwhile vw is closing down their factories in germany. advertisement by word of mouth you see ford focus 1.0 ecoboost billboard ads everywhere in europe and ram jeep chevy silverado f 150 hyundai kia ads everywhere in the us. tsla built itself on word of mouth and a vision for the future which is a testament to its value for customers. elon s proven track record in business . with someone so unreasonably effective at building things that work investors project that tsla is a safe and promising bet. how many reusable rockets has anybody else caught landing recently criticisms no product or company is without criticisms. from the bad build quality to the still unfulfilled fsd promises to the lack of cybertrucks in europe to the removal of the turn signal stalks and most recently the political criticisms. consequential actions not ideologies drive the world the bottom line for a business is creating products and services that people love and there are zero indicators that tsla as a business is going anywhere. it thrives despite all criticism and lack of marketing which is a testament to the value they provide. market temper tantrums are a feature not a bug look beyond the ephemeral temper tantrum driven volatility of the market. last year in march goog dipped from 160 to 135 when gemini generated some questionable images today it s close to ath at 200. last year in august crwd dipped from 380 to 220 when they pushed out a buggy update. today it s trading close to ath again. today the market finally noticed deepseek and is going through yet another mental breakdown. it is like a palm tree it will bend but it won t break. learn to put your prejudices aside and buy companies that execute well not companies with a nice little pr team that will sweet talk you. but is it overpriced by traditional fundamentals analysis of course it is. but we ve already established there s nothing traditional about tsla as a company so your little p e ratio calculations won t work. they have failed consistently. look at the execution of tsla and compare it to its western competitors they aren t even in the same league.
2025-01-27,2025-01-27 14:55:01,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",wallstreetbets,sell side analyst notes on nvda this morning sell side analyst notes on nvda this morning [TITLE_END] bofa deepseek concerns overblown in ai semis but foundational models keep demand high on january 20 china based ai lab deepseek created a mini flurry in the ai semiconductor space by releasing a free open source r1 model that reportedly outperforms leading western ai models such as openai s gpt 4. the model s creators claimed it took only two months and less than $6 million to build using older generation nvidia h800 chips. if accurate this advancement suggests model usefulness and accuracy might not scale directly with compute memory networking potentially reducing the demand for expensive ai chips. however we believe this concern about slowing ai scaling is overstated. based on available data deepseek s model appears to be a distilled model relying on larger foundation models like meta s open source llama. it is these foundational llms where significant and rising infrastructure costs are incurred as evidenced by meta s plan to raise cy25e capex by over 56 year over year to $60 $65 billion. in our view we will continue to see increasing compute demand driven by a mix of large foundational models derivative models and inference at scale across diverse cloud enterprise and sovereign ai customers. we maintain our buy ratings on nvidia broadcom and marvell technology . jpmorgan analyst sandeep deshpande investors are concerned that rather than impede china s progress in ai the us restrictions have engendered innovation that has enabled the development of a model that prioritises efficiency. ... the news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of microsoft which is spending $80bn in 25 while meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn. open ai also announced that the stargate project intends to invest $500m over the next four years building new ai infrastructure in the us. thus with these considerable sums flowing into ai investments in the us that deepseek s highly efficient and lower resource intensive ai model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the ai investment cycle may be over hyped and a more efficient future is possible. jefferies analyst edison lee re evaluating computing power needs could cause 2026 ai capex to fall ...we believe ds s success could drive two possible industry strategies 1 still pursue more computing power to drive even faster model improvements and 2 refocus on efficiency and roi meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026. bernstein analyst stacy rasgon is deepseek doomsday for ai buildouts we don t think so...we believe that 1 deepseek did not build openai for $5m 2 the models look fantastic but we don t think they are miracles and 3 the resulting twitterverse panic over the weekend seems overblown. though rasgon acknowledged deepseek s models are good. the analyst kept his outperform ratings on nvidia and broadcom advising clients not to buy into the doomsday scenarios. citi analyst malik while the dominance of the us companies on the most advanced ai models could be potentially challenged that said we estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment us access to more advanced chips is an advantage. thus we don t expect leading ai companies would move away from more advanced gpus. malik maintained a buy rating on nvidia . raymond james semiconductor analyst srini pajjuri if deepseek s innovations are adopted broadly an argument can be made that model training costs could come down significantly even at u.s. hyperscalers potentially raising questions about the need for 1 million xpu gpu clusters as projected by some... a more logical implication is that deepseek will drive even more urgency among u.s. hyperscalers to leverage their key advantage to distance themselves from cheaper alternatives. pajjuri reiterated buy ratings on nvidia and asml. cantor analyst c.j. muse following release of deepseek s v3 llm there has been great angst as to the impact for compute demand and therefore fears of peak spending on gpus. we think this view is farthest from the truth and that the announcement is actually very bullish with agi seemingly closer to reality and jevons paradox almost certainly leading to the ai industry wanting more compute not less. muse said buy nvidia on any weakness.
2025-01-27,2025-01-27 16:28:40,TSLA,Tesla,investing,third coast bancshares continued growth in a booming region third coast bancshares continued growth in a booming region [TITLE_END] i have been covering numerous small mid cap banks for quite some time now and i am bullish on the continued growth of many names. tcbx is based in the high growth texas metropolitan areas with very impressive growth despite the fact texas has more banks than any other state. here is my analysis on this particular community bank hope to hear from everyone on their thoughts on this company the future outlook on financials macro overview economic strength of texas third coast operates in texas whom remain one of the fastest growing states in the u.s. that recently faster than the nation as a whole. business friendly policies like no state income tax have helped corporate relocation s like tesla oracle and hewlett packard. texas s economy is the when compared to nations of the world and is now valued at $2.6 trillion. texas is expected to continue to grow and with that the need for lending capabilities should favor third coast. impact of potential deregulation in the new administrations economic agenda. for community banks like third coast this will allow them the ability to operate more freely with relaxed capital requirements. with fewer regulatory requirements third coast can selectively increase their exposure to higher yielding loans and potential acquisitions. typically the ability to freely lend boosts bank earnings and growth. it allows the industry the flexibility to regulate themselves. with deregulation almost certain focusing on further risk taking is important. this approach may lead to increases in nonperforming loans down the line. investment thesis presence in a high growth region texas has one of the strongest economies in the u.s. consistently outpacing the national gdp growth rate. third coast has shown a great track record of impressive growth with a cagr of over 25 and eps growth of over 18 from 2020 to 2024. deregulation in the banking industry is all but certain in the coming months. this will lead to increased lending capabilities that will fuel additional growth in a region that continues to outperform. third coast s lending increased 9 to $3.97 billion. urban centers like austin dallas fort worth and houston are hubs for technology energy and manufacturing. in particular residential construction is anticipated to rebound in 2025 fueled by increased populations jobs and incomes. current valuation third coast has a p e of 14.65 slightly below the yet the stock has risen over 93 in the last year alone and is just 2.5 from its 52 week high of $37.65. despite the significant increase third coast is still slightly undervalued. it is significantly under their five year average high p e of 16.9. with continued growth expected in the long term we believe it is best to either wait for a potential pullback or continue holding. strong financial results fierce competition in texas is intense with hundreds of banks. nevertheless third coast has achieved impressive results since their 2021 ipo. revenue has increased 80 eps 194 and net income 317 . profitability metrics like return on average assets return on average equity and net profit margin have set new records. they have hit highs of 1.05 11.48 and 27.82 respectively. nonperforming assets did however increase by 48.7 to 0.58 of total assets. while increases are not desired the total is still significantly under the industry average indicating proper risk management for now. loan growth quality nonperforming loans often solid loan growth comes with risky lending practices. third coast predominately lends to cre and c i combined accounting for almost 60 of the total portfolio. nonperforming loans increased by 61.4 to $27.95 million. a large reason for such a major increase stemmed from c i accounting for over 51 of nonperforming loans. non farm non residential owner occupied loans accounted for 39 . fortunately non farm non residential owner occupied loans decreased 14 despite their 11.3 weighting. nonperforming assets unsurprisingly nonperforming assets increased by 48.7 as a result. currently nonperforming assets are only at 0.58 which is still minor for a community bank. we do not want to see a continuation of nonperforming assets. they can easily start to wipe out a bank s equity. third coast has grown fantastically as has nonperforming loans and assets. both are now at all time highs for the banks. we will be monitoring this development in the upcoming quarters to ensure this does not rapidly continue. earnings overview revenue fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 16 to $171.38 million. third coast benefited from a 15.2 increase in net interest income due to elevated interest rates. this allowed the bank to reprice loans at higher yields. floating rate loans especially boosted interest income despite rising deposit costs. total non interest income also saw impressive growth of 29.4 to $10.62 million contributing to the overall increase in revenue. net income an impressive increase of 42.7 lead to a total of $47.67 million. this increase was primarily the result of increased net interest income resulting from loan growth. eps earnings per share saw strength with growth of 40.4 to $2.78. higher revenue controlled cost management and rising profitability were the primarily reasons for such an increase.

hancock gore ltd. is an investment company. the firm invests in diversified asset categories including listed and unlisted equities and private equity investments. the company was founded on october 29 1904 and is headquartered in sydney australia. historical financial analysis the company experienced a remarkable operational transformation in 2021 following its recapitalization in 2020. prior to this change the company boasted a robust revenue stream generating nearly $40 million from various segments including building products healthcare and health beauty. however despite this substantial revenue the company faced challenges in achieving healthy profit margins. since 2021 although revenues have decreased and are now solely derived from its investment portfolio the company has managed to report impressive profits amounting to $8.17 million in 2023 compared to only $1.1 million in 2019 despite revenues of only $5.58 million. the recapitalization also positively impacted the company s balance sheet allowing for a significant increase in assets from $35 million in 2020 to $70 million in 2023. concurrently liabilities which stood at nearly $20 million in 2020 have diminished to less than $1 million thereby substantially improving the book value for shareholders. growth catalyst the recent acquisition of schoolblazer by the company following its increased investment in mountcastle to achieve full ownership represents a strategically advantageous decision. this acquisition is anticipated to enable the company to capture a substantially larger portion of the market as schoolblazer is strategically aligned with core competencies that mountcastle currently lacks and vice versa. the synergy between these complementary business models is expected to lead to a significant increase in market share for mountcastle especially considering that schoolblazer expands mountcastle s footprint from the value and mid consumer market segments through its established presence in the premium market segment.

welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start here are your pre market stock movers news on this tuesday january the 28th 2025 s p 500 futures were relatively unchanged early tuesday following a sell off fueled by worries over the emergence of chinese startup deepseek and its greater implications for the artificial intelligence trade. futures tied to the s p 500 along with nasdaq 100 futures traded just above the flatline rising 0.1 . futures tied to the dow jones industrial average were also flat. futures were trading in step with nvidia in the premarket with both trading off their highs

history. broadcom and oracle also traded higher by more than 2 and around 1 respectively. concerns over deepseek came to a head on monday with the nasdaq composite losing more than 3 while the s p 500 slid about 1.5 . the chinese startup last month unveiled a free open source large language model that it says took less than $6 million to build. the development spurred worries around big tech s investment into ai. deepseek surpassed rival openai on monday to become the most downloaded free app in the u.s. on apple s app store. valuations remain extended and while vulnerabilities were expected this year developments like deepseek highlight the need for diversification beyond the mag seven said seema shah chief global strategist at principal asset management. the 2025 theme of us

despite strong underlying asset value significant hidden real estate assets and a near term deleveraging catalyst the stock trades at only 0.4x book value well below its intrinsic worth. we believe wall street misprices kodak by failing to incorporate the imminent launch of its pharma division in 2025 with attractive margin dynamics. debt reduction from pension surplus improving fcf and balance sheet health. strong tariff tailwinds under the trump administration positioning kodak as a beneficiary of u.s. domestic manufacturing policies. underappreciated real estate assets with a potential

highly asymmetric deep value opportunity with significant potential for re rating in 2025. eli5 why kodak is a good investment right now imagine you have an old company like kodak which used to make cameras and films. people think it s outdated but here s the secret kodak is quietly transforming into something much bigger. and wall street isn t paying attention yet . here s why smart investors might want to take a closer look at kodak 1 kodak is getting into pharmaceuticals kodak is building a factory to make ingredients for medicines. this new business starts in 2025 and will make a lot more money per dollar spent than selling old school film and prints. think of it like kodak switching from selling dvds to streaming movies it s the future this new drug business could bring in over $250m a year in just a few years. 2 kodak is paying off a ton of debt kodak had a special pension fund with $1.08 billion saved up. they will use $315m to pay down debt meaning they don t have to pay as much interest anymore . this frees up an extra $25m per year less debt stronger company more money to grow the business . 3 hidden gold mine kodak owns a huge industrial park kodak owns eastman business park a 1 200 acre industrial site. right now it s on the books for only $60m but it s actually worth $175m . if they sell or rent out more space kodak could make a lot of extra money . 4 the government might help kodak the u.s. wants to make more stuff at home . kodak makes things in america which means they could get government support and win new contracts. if new tariffs happen kodak s u.s. made products become more valuable . 5 kodak s stock is too cheap right now kodak is trading at $6.79 per share. experts say it should be worth between $11.50 $24.00 per share that means the stock could double or even triple in price. what s next kodak is no longer just an old camera company. with pharma real estate and smart debt moves it could become a big winner in the next couple of years. new drug business more profits less debt more cash to grow hidden assets even more value government policies possible tailwinds right now wall street isn t paying attention but soon they might. sources bonus real life dd i did not know but check how active are the kodak clients fans on other subredits there are literally dozens of posts each day including the word kodak . also the 90s are trendy these days it is not unusual to see gen z youngsters with analogic cameras. $m $m $m $m $m $m

as investors turned toward the first federal reserve interest rate decision of 2025. futures tied to the dow jones industrial average inched down 13 points. nasdaq 100 futures were 0.3 higher while s p 500 futures was trading around the flatline. tech stocks on tuesday led the s p 500 higher and brought the nasdaq composite to a 2 gain. the two indexes made a comeback after incurring sharp losses on monday in a sell off spurred by the emergence of china s deepseek and the threat it poses to the artificial intelligence trade. nvidia which suffered a roughly 17 decline monday jumped nearly 9 on tuesday. as far as the deepseek news over the weekend at the end of the day today there really hasn t been that much of an impact on a market wide basis bespoke investment group co founder paul hickey said tuesday on cnbc s closing bell overtime. the fed s interest rate decision on wednesday is now a focal point for investors as well as fed chair jerome powell s press conference. fed funds futures data reflect a nearly 100 certainty that the central bank will keep rates steady at a target range of 4.25 to 4.5 according to cme group data. when it comes to the fed they re widely not expected to do anything tomorrow and that s a good thing. the less the fed has to do the better it is for the market in our view hickey added. investors will be paying especially close attention to powell s

2025-01-29,2025-01-29 14:47:49,TSLA,Tesla,stocks,wednesday s pre market news stock movers wednesday s pre market news stock movers [TITLE_END] good morning traders and investors of the r stocks sub welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start here are your pre market stock movers news on this wednesday january the 29th 2025 stock futures were near the flatline on wednesday as investors turned toward the first federal reserve interest rate decision of 2025. futures tied to the dow jones industrial average inched down 13 points. nasdaq 100 futures were 0.3 higher while s p 500 futures was trading around the flatline. tech stocks on tuesday led the s p 500 higher and brought the nasdaq composite to a 2 gain. the two indexes made a comeback after incurring sharp losses on monday in a sell off spurred by the emergence of china s deepseek and the threat it poses to the artificial intelligence trade. nvidia which suffered a roughly 17 decline monday jumped nearly 9 on tuesday. as far as the deepseek news over the weekend at the end of the day today there really hasn t been that much of an impact on a market wide basis bespoke investment group co founder paul hickey said tuesday on cnbc s closing bell overtime. the fed s interest rate decision on wednesday is now a focal point for investors as well as fed chair jerome powell s press conference. fed funds futures data reflect a nearly 100 certainty that the central bank will keep rates steady at a target range of 4.25 to 4.5 according to cme group data. when it comes to the fed they re widely not expected to do anything tomorrow and that s a good thing. the less the fed has to do the better it is for the market in our view hickey added. investors will be paying especially close attention to powell s comments his first press conference in president donald trump s second term. the two have had a contentious relationship dating back to trump s first term. the president has already said he would demand that

2025-01-29,2025-01-29 15:39:27,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,tesla s earning reports are useless tesla s earning reports are useless [TITLE_END] with the current political and regulatory environment it s becoming clear that elon musk and tesla can get away with as much fraud as they want. the sec doj and other oversight agencies have either been neutered or are unwilling to go after him in any meaningful way. the latest earnings reports might as well be fiction. we ve already seen tesla repeatedly overpromise and underdeliver whether it s fsd production numbers or financial projections. but now with regulators looking the other way and politicians either enabling or actively shielding musk there are effectively no consequences for misleading investors. if there s no real enforcement what s stopping tesla from manipulating numbers to prop up the stock and if investors and analysts just keep buying into the hype regardless of fundamentals what s the point of even pretending these earnings reports mean anything at this point tesla s valuation has become a faith based system rather than one grounded in financial reality. how long can this charade last

2025-01-30,2025-01-30 15:00:36,TSLA,Tesla,StockMarket,hardware 3 is useless for autonomy implications hardware 3 is useless for autonomy implications [TITLE_END] i don t get how everyone s glossing over the fact that elon literally admitted hardware 3 won t cut it for self driving. for years we heard flip of a switch and boom your tesla s a robotaxi. now it s oh you actually need hardware 4 . meanwhile there aren t even that many hardware 4 cars on the road and full autonomy definitely isn t happening in six months. they re supposedly starting in austin probably with a safety driver babysitting the whole thing and it ll be a very slow ramp assuming they can scale at all. musk also admitted training optimus is a much bigger lift than he let on. if fsd is any indication we are a longggg way off. so what exactly are people investing in at this point the numbers suck most of their earnings are from regulatory credits and bitcoin and the stock price is propped up by hype and promises that keep shifting. i can t be the only one seeing this right
