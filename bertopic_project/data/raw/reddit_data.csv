Meta and Tesla crashed on earnings drop due to missing Q1 forecasts before recovering. Microsoft crashed after Q1 forecast released on earnings call.

Microsoft hinted ""data center computing"" execution driving capacity constraints through Q1, mirroring reports of Blackwell chips overheating earlier this year.

Not surprisingly, Deepseek inference cost reduction implications due to MOE approach yet to be factored in; capex estimates seem to be in line with end of year plans.

Apple on deck today. Profitability expected to be good due to efficiency in production, but Q1 forecasted top line also expected to be trash due to China and Apple intelligence failing.

Still a believer in big tech, but current multiples are historically high with interest rates still near historic highs in the near future which implies expectations of meteoric growth. There seems to be hell of a lot of risk in the market for big bets that won't play out for at least 6 months.

If this pump holds up: QQQ 2/14 520P

To be clear, not all bad news. Killer profitability from Meta, and Musk did a masterpiece on painting the future of FSD and Optimus sooner than we thought, but that's what Musk does. And Netflix crushed it. And I'm a believer that Jevons paradox will eventually play out, just not immediately for Q1.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

2025-01-29,20:08:22,wallstreetbets,Considering TSLA Earnings today,"I'm re-writing to better along with WSB's rules. I haven't really made a text post here before but I've seen the type of DD posted here and wanted to put in my own thoughts and get everyone's idea on Tesla's earnings today. I'm not here to suggest plays or talk about Elon's Tweets. Just the raw facts and what people think of the stock.

First off, Tesla is expected to report an adjusted profit of 77 cents per share, with sales at $27.2 billion. That's a step up from last year's 71 cents per share and $25.2 billion in sales. That's pretty good. In Q4 2024, Tesla cranked out approximately 459,000 vehicles and delivered over 495,000. While these are record numbers, they still fell short of the ambitious targets set by the Musk himself. That being said, these are all previous numbers and we need to try to predict today's numbers. With expectations so high, it might be difficult to beat earnings tonight.

We need to address the new administration obviously. They're going to be phasing out EV incentives so Tesla's projected sales might not be as high as we think. Elon has been touting a 20%-30% sales growth for 2025, but with reduced EV demand and competition from China... it might not be realistic.

Tesla might announce advancements in autonomous driving and upcoming product launches to keep the momentum going. A lower-priced EV, updated models, and the potential rollout of Full Self-Driving and robotaxi services are all in the pipeline. If Tesla can pull these off, it might just silence the haters and send the shorts running for cover. However, considering the last 10 years of ""improvements,"" it's highly unlikely.

Now consider what I've written above and the fact that the stock has dropped drastically 5 out of 7 previous earnings. What do you guys think?",TSLA,Tesla

I'm re-writing to better along with WSB's rules. I recently tried to make a post about Tesla but it was taken down too by an AI bot for being too political? This is my first discussion post so I'm really testing out the waters on this sub. 

Meta Platforms is set to announce its fourth-quarter results after the market closes and from what I've read analysts are predicting earnings of $6.76 per share, up from $5.33 a year ago. Revenue is expected to hit $47.04 billion, marking a 17% increase year-over-year. Right now it seems like people are particularly keen to see how Meta's hefty investments in artificial intelligence are paying off.

Unfortunately for Meta, DeepSeek has been making waves with its R1 model. It's a Chinese competitor that matches the capabilities of models from U.S. giants like OpenAI and Meta but was developed at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek's success has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, causing significant stock drops for companies like Nvidia. It's pretty common for China to steal proprietary tech and incorporate it into their own creations, but their AI is entirely open source, unlike OpenAI. This would allow American companies to, in turn, take their new research and work with it. For those who don't know, Meta themselves has an Open-Source Strategy. Their Cheif AI Scientist, Yann LeCun isn't sweating it, though. DeepSeek's R1 is open-source, just like Meta's own Llama model, which in turn validates Meta's open-source approach. Collaboration and transparency might be the goal in the AI race. However, people are wondering how such advancements could be made with such a low budget. This puts into question the amount of funding and money that's currently going into AI.

Despite the DeepSeek-induced drop, Meta's stock has shown resilience. Analysts at Citi argue that Meta could actually benefit from DeepSeek's innovations by incorporating them to enhance its own AI tools, potentially leading to more efficient operations and better returns on investment. As Meta prepares to unveil its earnings, everyone wants to see how the company plans to monetize its AI investments and respond to the rising competition from players like DeepSeek. The tech landscape is shifting, and Meta's next moves could set the tone for the industry's future.

But the earning call won't be entirely about AI. They obviously own Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Advertising remains the cornerstone of Meta's revenue, accounting for approximately 98% of its total income. I believe Meta's significant investments in artificial intelligence have enhanced its advertising capabilities. AI-powered tools like Advantage+ and generative AI enable advertisers to create highly targeted campaigns, leading to increased return on ad spend. The company reported a 7% year-over-year increase in ad impressions and an 11% rise in average ad prices. Over a million businesses utilized Meta's generative AI tools to produce 15 million ads in a single month, resulting in a 7% uplift in conversions.

Meta's platforms continue to see robust user engagement. The company boasts 3.29 billion daily active users, a 5% increase from the previous year. AI-enhanced content recommendations have driven higher engagement, particularly for video content, thereby boosting advertising opportunities. However, Despite these positive indicators, Meta faces several challenges. The company's Reality Labs division, focused on metaverse initiatives, is expected to report a $5 billion loss for Q4, continuing to weigh on overall profitability. Additionally, regulatory scrutiny, such as the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, poses risks to Meta's data-driven advertising model, potentially leading to increased compliance costs and fines. Competition from platforms like TikTok, Google, and Amazon remains intense, with TikTok's popularity among younger users particularly threatening Meta's growth in key demographics.

2025-01-29,04:16:58,wallstreetbets,Microsoft and OpenAI Probing If DeepSeek-Linked Group Improperly Obtained OpenAI Data,"> Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI are investigating whether data output from OpenAI’s technology was obtained in an unauthorized manner by a group linked to Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek, according to people familiar with the matter.

> Microsoft’s security researchers in the fall observed individuals they believe may be linked to DeepSeek exfiltrating a large amount of data using the OpenAI application programming interface, or API, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Software developers can pay for a license to use the API to integrate OpenAI’s proprietary artificial intelligence models into their own applications.

> Microsoft, an OpenAI technology partner and its largest investor, notified OpenAI of the activity, the people said. Such activity could violate OpenAI’s terms of service or could indicate the group acted to remove OpenAI’s restrictions on how much data they could obtain, the people said.

> DeepSeek earlier this month released a new open-source artificial intelligence model called R1 that can mimic the way humans reason, upending a market dominated by OpenAI and US rivals such as Google and Meta Platforms Inc. The Chinese upstart said R1 rivaled or outperformed leading US developers’ products on a range of industry benchmarks, including for mathematical tasks and general knowledge — and was built for a fraction of the cost. The potential threat to the US firms’ edge in the industry sent technology stocks tied to AI, including Microsoft, Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., tumbling on Monday, erasing a total of almost $1 trillion in market value.

> David Sacks, President Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence czar, said Tuesday there’s “substantial evidence” that DeepSeek leaned on the output of OpenAI’s models to help develop its own technology. In an interview with Fox News, Sacks described a technique called distillation whereby one AI model uses the outputs of another for training purposes to develop similar capabilities.

> “There’s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled knowledge out of OpenAI models and I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this,” Sacks said, without detailing the evidence.

> In a statement responding to Sacks’ comments, OpenAI didn’t directly address his comments about DeepSeek. “We know PRC based companies — and others — are constantly trying to distill the models of leading US AI companies,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in the statement, referring to the People’s Republic of China. “As the leading builder of AI, we engage in countermeasures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models, and believe as we go forward that it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.”",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

# Eastman Kodak Company (NYSE: KODK) – Equity Research Report

# Rating: Overweight | Target Price: $18.50 | Current Price: $6.79

# Sector: Specialty Chemicals & Industrial Manufacturing

# Investment Summary

We initiate coverage on Eastman Kodak (NYSE: KODK) with an **Overweight** rating and a **target price of $18.50**, representing a **172% upside**. Kodak is undergoing a **structural transformation**, pivoting from a declining legacy print business into higher-margin verticals such as **pharmaceutical manufacturing and advanced materials**. Despite strong **underlying asset value**, significant **hidden real estate assets**, and a **near-term deleveraging catalyst**, the stock trades at **only 0.4x book value**, well below its intrinsic worth.

We believe **Wall Street misprices Kodak** by failing to incorporate:  
✅ The **imminent launch of its pharma division in 2025**, with attractive margin dynamics.  
✅ **Debt reduction from pension surplus**, improving FCF and balance sheet health.  
✅ **Strong tariff tailwinds under the Trump administration**, positioning Kodak as a beneficiary of U.S. domestic manufacturing policies.  
✅ **Underappreciated real estate assets (Eastman Business Park)**, with a potential fair value of **$175M-$200M**.

# ELI5: Why Kodak is a Good Investment Right Now 📈

Imagine you have **an old company like Kodak**, which used to make cameras and films. People think it’s outdated, but here’s the **secret**—Kodak is quietly transforming into something much bigger. And **Wall Street isn’t paying attention yet**.

Here’s why **smart investors** might want to take a closer look at Kodak:

# 1️⃣ Kodak Is Getting Into Pharmaceuticals (Drugs 💊)

* Kodak is **building a factory** to make ingredients for medicines.
* This **new business starts in 2025** and will make **a lot more money per dollar spent** than selling old-school film and prints.
* Think of it like Kodak **switching from selling DVDs to streaming movies—it’s the future!**
* **This new drug business could bring in over $250M a year** in just a few years.

# 2️⃣ Kodak Is Paying Off a TON of Debt 💰

* Kodak had **a special pension fund with $1.08 BILLION** saved up.
* They will use **$315M to pay down debt**, meaning they **don’t have to pay as much interest anymore**.
* **This frees up an extra $25M per year!**
* Less debt = **stronger company + more money to grow the business**.

# 3️⃣ Hidden Gold Mine: Kodak Owns a HUGE Industrial Park 🏭

* Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP)**, a **1,200-acre** industrial site.
* Right now, it’s on the books for **only $60M**, but it’s actually worth **$175M+**.
* If they **sell or rent out more space**, Kodak could **make a lot of extra money**.

# 4️⃣ The Government Might Help Kodak (Trump's Trade Policies 🇺🇸)

* The U.S. **wants to make more stuff at home** (like medicine and tech parts).
* Kodak **makes things in America**, which means **they could get government support** and win new contracts.
* If new tariffs (taxes on foreign goods) happen, Kodak’s **U.S.-made products become more valuable**.

# 5️⃣ Kodak’s Stock Is TOO CHEAP 📉

📌 **Right now, Kodak is trading at $6.79 per share.**  
📌 **Experts say it should be worth between $11.50 - $24.00 per share!**  
📌 That means the stock **could DOUBLE or even TRIPLE** in price.

# 💡 What’s Next?

Kodak is **no longer just an “old camera company.”** With **pharma, real estate, and smart debt moves**, it **could become a big winner** in the next couple of years.

✅ **New drug business = more profits**  
✅ **Less debt = more cash to grow**  
✅ **Hidden assets = even more value**  
✅ **Government policies = possible tailwinds**

**Right now, Wall Street isn’t paying attention… but soon, they might.** 🚀

2025-01-28,21:50:47,wallstreetbets,$NVDA $12k short,"NVDA crash has nothing to do with deepseek

Deepseek is actually only the catalyst and not the cause. It's the straw that broke the camels back. When is the last time you saw a public company in the top 10 valuation in sp500 have a net margin of over 50%? Never. 

Also the growth projection that is priced it has 2 assumptions:

1. Net margin of 50% (gross margin of over 80%) going forward. 

2. The rate of purchase will increase. Not only will people need to keep buying, they will need to buy more than last year, which saw companies fomo into datacenters. 


It's not that deepseek will cause companies to just stop buying GPUs. It's that companies are not going to buy exponentially more GPUs indefinitely. Especially when they've left so much on the table in terms of software optimizations. 


Even if companies still fomo hard into GPUs and datacenters at the same rate as 2024, NVDA stock will fall, because there's no additional growth. 

If people buy more, but the margins get tighter as apple, meta, google come out with their own chips or tpus, Nividia stock will fall. 

If sales go down and margins get tighter, it's doomsday for NVDA stock. Like -50%+ type of collapse",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

2025-01-27,23:18:07,wallstreetbets,Nvidia’s $590 Billion DeepSeek Rout Is Largest in Market History,"ALTERNATIVE SOURCE — Bloomberg: Nvidia Corp.’s plunge, fueled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the world’s largest company. 

Nvidia shares tumbled 17% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020, erasing $589 billion from the company’s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record — a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value — and was the biggest in US stock-market history. 

The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Monday’s slump, Nvidia selloffs have caused eight of the top ten biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell 1.5% Monday and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3%.

The semiconductor maker led a broader selloff in technology stocks after DeepSeek’s low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing artificial intelligence. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price. 

The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Apple Inc.’s App Store rankings. 

“Concerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,” Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients.

Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because they design semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that aren’t showing a sufficient return on the investment. 

Meta announced plans on Friday to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as $65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. announcing a $100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centers and AI infrastructure projects around the US. 

In a bid to stall China’s progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeek’s progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources.

Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek’s model is an “excellent AI advancement” and indicated that the Chinese company didn’t violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, requires “requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.”

2025-01-27,20:10:57,wallstreetbets,Deepseek is good for $NVDA - Here's why,"So unless you've been living under a rock, NVIDIA's stock just took a massive hit (-16%) after this Chinese company DeepSeek dropped what might be the biggest AI flex of 2025: They supposedly built a GPT-4 level model for just $6M. Not billion. Million. Using old NVIDIA hardware that China's not even supposed to have anymore.

I've been following the AI space for a while, and this is wild for a few reasons:

First off, this is basically like someone saying they built a Ferrari in their garage for the price of a used Civic. Everyone's freaking out because if these folks really pulled this off with older GPUs (H800s/A100s), what's even the point of dropping $30k+ on new H100s?

The Elon drama isn't helping either - my man's out here claiming DeepSeek's got 50k illegal H100s stashed under some boba shop in Shenzhen 💀

But here's where it gets interesting - there's this old economic concept called Jevons Paradox (bear with me). Basically, when something gets more efficient/cheaper, people end up using MORE of it, not less. Think about when coal got more efficient in the 1800s - instead of using less coal, suddenly everything and their mother was running on steam power.

So here's my spicy take: What if cheaper AI training is actually GOOD for NVIDIA? Follow me here:

* If building AI models gets stupid cheap, every CS dropout with a dream is gonna try launching an AI startup
* All those AIs need somewhere to actually run (inference)
* And guess who makes the best chips for running AI? Our boys in green

I mean, Zuck just committed $65B to AI infrastructure. My man's buying GPUs like they're Taylor Swift tickets lmao

That said, I'm the same idiot who bought AMD at the top, so maybe take this with a grain of salt 🤡

Curious what you all think:

* Are we witnessing the end of NVIDIA's AI dominance or is this a massive overreaction?
* If China's doing this much with old hardware, how screwed is Silicon Valley?
* Is your portfolio also on fire or did you actually listen to your financial advisor?

2025-01-27,14:55:01,wallstreetbets,Sell side analyst notes on NVDA this morning,"BofA: 'DeepSeek Concerns Overblown in AI Semis; but Foundational Models Keep Demand High'

 ""On January 20, China-based AI lab DeepSeek created a mini-flurry in the AI semiconductor space by releasing a free, open-source R1 model that reportedly outperforms leading Western AI models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4. The model's creators claimed it took only two months and less than $6 million to build using older-generation NVIDIA H800 chips.

If accurate, this advancement suggests model usefulness and accuracy might not scale directly with compute/memory/networking, potentially reducing the demand for expensive AI chips. However, we believe this concern about slowing AI scaling is overstated. Based on available data, DeepSeek's model appears to be a 'distilled' model relying on larger foundation models like Meta's open-source Llama.

It is these foundational LLMs where significant and rising infrastructure costs are incurred, as evidenced by Meta's plan to raise CY25E capex by over 56% year-over-year to $60-$65 billion. In our view, we will continue to see increasing compute demand driven by a mix of large foundational models (both proprietary and open-source), derivative models (leveraging techniques such as knowledge distillation, sparse attention, and low-rank factorization), and inference at scale across diverse cloud, enterprise, and sovereign AI customers.

We maintain our Buy ratings on NVIDIA (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Marvell Technology (MRVL).""

JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande: ""Investors are concerned that rather than impede China's progress in AI, the US restrictions have engendered innovation that has enabled the development of a model that prioritises efficiency. ... The news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of Microsoft, which is spending $80bn in '25, while Meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn. Open AI also announced that the Stargate project intends to invest $500m over the next four years building new AI infrastructure in the US. Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek's highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible."" 

Jefferies analyst Edison Lee: ""Re-evaluating computing power needs could cause 2026 AI Capex to fall (or not grow)...We believe DS's success could drive two possible industry strategies: 1) still pursue more computing power to drive even faster model improvements, and 2) refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026."" 

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon: ""Is DeepSeek doomsday for AI buildouts? We don't think so...we believe that 1) DeepSeek DID NOT ""build OpenAI for $5M""; 2) the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and 3) the resulting Twitterverse panic over the weekend seems overblown."" Though Rasgon acknowledged DeepSeek's models are good. The analyst kept his outperform ratings on Nvidia and Broadcom, advising clients not to buy into the doomsday scenarios. 

Citi analyst Malik: ""While the dominance of the US companies on the most advanced AI models could be potentially challenged, that said, we estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US' access to more advanced chips is an advantage. Thus, we don't expect leading AI companies would move away from more advanced GPUs."" Malik maintained a buy rating on Nvidia . 

Raymond James' semiconductor analyst Srini Pajjuri: ""If DeepSeek's innovations are adopted broadly, an argument can be made that model training costs could come down significantly even at U.S. hyperscalers, potentially raising questions about the need for 1-million XPU/GPU clusters as projected by some...: A more logical implication is that DeepSeek will drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers to leverage their key advantage (access to GPUs) to distance themselves from cheaper alternatives."" Pajjuri reiterated buy ratings on Nvidia and ASML. 

Cantor analyst C.J. Muse: ""Following release of DeepSeek's V3 LLM, there has been great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs. We think this view is farthest from the truth and that the announcement is actually very bullish with AGI seemingly closer to reality and Jevons Paradox almost certainly leading to the AI industry wanting more compute, not less."" Muse said buy Nvidia on any weakness.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

2025-01-27,00:18:37,wallstreetbets,My loss of 2024,"The word of the day is greed. I started trading options this year (2024) and this is how it went. 
Messed around with some small cap calls lost 100% on some and made 300% on others. my eyes grew big I had no idea you could make 300% off a stock moving 5 or 10%. 
I went HEAVEY into Dd around June and would stay up all night sometimes just to loose the next day but I never gave up. One day around September when they did the rate cuts I heard the news bought in Nvidia and QQQ calls right before close. They both gapped up the next day. I traded on that market open ended up making quite a few trades turned $200 into 5000 in 24 hours.  
I go back to focusing on DD and find my next opportunity.  I remember trading other things making too many trades. Started drinking a lot wishing everyday could be like that day. My account goes down to 2,000. I put everything into Tesla calls right before earnings and my sober mind set up the play where I could buy 100 shares of Tesla at 230 for just 1800 dollars. How? Well Tesla was at 216 and had record sells so I bought a weekly 230 and 13 weekly 240s. I’ll be damned if that plan didn’t work out. But my paper handing ass sold at market open and fucked it all up.  That’s where the downward spiral started. 

In the next trading week 

I went all in on qqq calls 1 dte and it tanked the next day. Anyways after that trade (late October) I went on a downward spiral and a pretty bad one. Almost lost everything. 
(Not just money but my family, house, business). 
I was drinking way to much to cope with the pain was my excuse. but on Christmas I put it down haven’t drank since. Everyday I do dd on company’s and watch the charts. plan my next move also started reading the intelligent investor that Warren buffet recommends. This year will be different I can feel it.

2025-01-24,21:17:55,wallstreetbets,DD: UiPath ($PATH) - Mispriced and Misunderstood,"I’m looking for the regardedest, lowest, humblest of you to confirm the way.

* Big brains didn’t agree when I said PLTR bumpy revenues weren’t a concern (2022).
* Big brains didn’t agree when I said get into Bitcoin before the wall street wave (2017).
* Big brains didn’t agree when I said Tesla revenues were about to go parabolic (2017).

It’s true when they say Bears sound smart at parties, but the bulls make money.  Big brains are too smart for their own good, blowing up fears in their minds.

Why do I even posts?  Selfishly, to have a record (Reddit post history) of being right.  I love looking back and saying yep, yep, yep and laughing at big brains while wiping my ass with cash.  I didn’t go to Harvard or work for a big firm. I have a chip on my shoulder and I’m here to outclass them all.

So, fellow idiots, I think we have another winner. Time to get hyped.

UiPath ($PATH) $13.86 ($7.617B Market Cap).

**Big brains claim RPA is dead** (https://a16z.com/rip-to-rpa-the-rise-of-intelligent-automation/)

\-	Those pushing AI Agents and claiming RPA is dead are wrong. They assume AI Agents can be developed by skipping straight to step Z, when in reality, they will need to build steps A-Y. AI currently only has a brain. It needs hands and tools connected it to perform real work. UiPath has built out steps A-Y and is ready to take step Z. UiPath is in a position to capitalize on the power of Gen AI.

\-	There’s a spectrum of automation applications and RPA will still make the most sense in many use cases as the most efficient tool for the job (less processing, lower costs and more energy efficient).  AI Agents will have their place, but UiPath will have a system to orchestrate the spectrum of tools spanning from RPA, hybrid to advanced AI agents.

**Big brains claim UiPath has no moat.**

\-	UiPath’s product is more differentiated than the market gives them credit for.  The market seems to conflate all RPA vendors as interchangeable, but I believe there are nuanced and important differences between the offerings.  UiPath appears to be the most robust, user friendly and an innovation leader.

Where’s their moat?

1. Network effects. They have a large install base with 10,000+ customers (easy to upsell clients),
2. UiPath is immune to vendor locking (can automate across many different software provider applications).
3. Preferred vendor/partner to major consulting companies (EY, Deloitte, Accenture).
4. Existing partnerships with major software companies gives UiPath exposure to potential new customers.
5. UiPath has a large base of experienced RPA developers that prefer to use UiPath and who are likely to recommend it where they go.
6. Founder led.  Founder is a product focused engineer, not a career executive playing politics in a bureaucracy. This allows UiPath to be nimbler and seize market opportunities as they arise.

**Big brains claim UiPath’s growth story is over.**

\-	Gen AI can have a similar effect on UiPath as it did on Palantir and their AIP product. Gen AI will make the existing UiPath platform exponentially more powerful, meaning more and higher value use cases. As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate.

**Big brains have beaten this stock to death.**

\-	This stock is down from all time highs at $85.12/share in 2021 to less than $14/share today.

\-	Big brains seem to be discounting UiPath’s potential at a current price-to-sales multiple of 5.275x. SAAS companies can easily trade between 10-20x.

\-	UiPath has $1.6B in cash and $0 debt.

\-	82% gross margins.

\-	113% net dollar retention

\-	On the verge of flipping profitable.

\-	Guidance from last earnings call, they said ARR is expected to stabilize and free cash flow to accelerate.

TLDR:

My bet is UiPath has a greater than 50% chance for growth reacceleration.

UiPath product differentiation will become more apparent in the future.

As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate. (i.e. similar to PLTR with AIP).

None of this is financial advice. I may or may not know what I’m doing.

Introduction: I have been very lucky this year playing puts and calls. I am already up over $103k since 1/1 and I have the receipts. (See my post history for some) So cry me a river indeed.

[Year to date gains in Etrade of $103k for 2025.](https://preview.redd.it/4vqv7g2chnde1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fa24697a1b42441ea4e3fbf31d43befc36709cb)

Nearly every single play has been buying puts when things seem irrationally high, or buying calls when they've fallen too far? What is too far? Good question. But to play this, you need volume and volatility.

$CEG (Constellation Energy Group) has been the perfect trade for that this year. Four times on three separate days I've bought puts on their frothiness. Yesterday I made $20k off $CEG in about an hour. Good work if you can get it.

[CEG Puts have gotten me $35k in gains even though the stock is up.](https://preview.redd.it/qemqizdvhnde1.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=5152767c694055798a43636ece96772a6b02faa4)

So that brings us to today. It's Friday, 0 Day Expiration party time! This morning, lots of things are green, and meme stock Elon plaything Tesla is blowing up like a SpaceX rocket over the Carribean. I am ready to make a killing. It's up 5% from the previous day and, if my results this year are right, it's going to go down. Everything returns to the mean. Nothing finishes at the high of the day.

So I buy 200 Put options for $1.24 at $430. It's a $25k bet and my account is ready.

[TSLA looking frothy midway through the day as I buy puts at 430.](https://preview.redd.it/k67m63joinde1.png?width=464&format=png&auto=webp&s=47da208c002804913328eb67a5dc5b96ba08f465)

But it doesn't go down right away. This is fine, I tell myself as the stock goes up to 436, 437... So I decide to double down and buy 150 put options for $1.46 at $435. It's a $22k bet. I've now got $47k on the line, about half my gains on the year. If the stock traces back to $430, it'll be great. $425 would make serious coin.

But I forgot Tesla stock is fucking insane and every regard in this sub is jerking it to this chart.

At this point, I have the live chart on my screen and I know I am going to eat shit and be down more than $40k and wipe out everything I've scammed for this year. Every time it comes down to 437, it goes back up to 439. 438. 439. 438. Stupid TSLA.

But wait! With an hour left it starts to fall, just like I thought it would. To $434 at least. My second buy is green more than $10k while my first one is pretty much toast. Every tick up or down is the worst. With less than an hour ago the flip flopping continues. $432. Back up to $433. I realize I am up $21k on one put and down $17k on the other put. I panic sell both and leave with $3k gains. Survival! I was stunned any dork bought my obviously dead put with minutes left.

So what happens? $TSLA crashes (of course) all the way to $426.50 at end of day. I was right.

[End of day: $TSLA at $426.5 after hitting $439 intraday](https://preview.redd.it/l2459uecknde1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=74e4ed83b0c3897783421e490ef372230d2d2177)

So let's do the math on those puts:  
$435 - $426.5 = $8.5 \* 150 \* 100 = $127,500  
$430 - $426.5 = $3.5 \* 200 \* 100 = $70,000

I would have cleared $197,500 instead of $3,200 because I was a paper handed bitch and didn't want to lose $47k. This is the worst $3k I've ever made. FML. ",TSLA,Tesla

Opening Scene of Ferris Bueller's Day Off: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuOHbyuanbY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuOHbyuanbY)

**Inauguration of Trump Monday** is priced in, and it was priced very high in November (Expectations high). What is not priced in, is the exact outcome of the flood of Executive Orders waiting to signed on Monday. We have some hints of what they will be, but I don’t think anyone knows exactly what they will be and how they will be viewed from the market. I expect a wild ride, but I don't think the outcomes will match the predictions.

**My Speculation:**

**1. National Emergency**

Who the hell knows what it will be? Economic? Border crisis? Public health? Your guess is as good as mine. But there will be one, and the markets won’t like it. (There are [several reports](https://www.beckersasc.com/supply-chain/trump-eyes-national-emergency-declaration-to-levy-tariffs.html) on this already.) Plus Trump declared seven national emergencies last time, and another would give him sweeping powers to make significant executive order changes. **Puts on SPX OTM.**

**2. Tariffs**

I’m taking the man at his word: tariffs are coming. The specifics—what and how much—remain unknown, but most economists agree this will be bad news. Tariffs also happen to feature in the intro to my favorite movie, so that’s good enough DD for me. Long **puts on XLY** and throwing in a little **SOYB puts** as well. (Thanks, [Soy Boy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i37uof/spilling_the_beans_on_tariffs_the_untold_story_of/).)

**3. Bitcoin (IBIT)**

I know, I know. But hear me out—Trump isn’t going to do anything to *hurt* BTC. At least not yet. There will at least be signaling of something positive (per many [news sources](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-bitcoin-crypto-day-one-first-100-days-executive-orders-policies/)). Plus, if the S&P 500 goes down, BTC believers will flock to it as a safe haven. If the S&P 500 goes up, BTC holders will reinvest their stock gains to buy more BTC. (My wild speculation is that banking regulation of BTC will be loosened, and the sale of existing US gov BTC will be halted.) Either way, it seems like Bitcoin has an upward trajectory. **Calls on IBIT.**

**4. Hedge**

If the markets tank, they’ll tank hard and my deep OTM puts will pay big. However, there’s always a chance they’ll go up. To cover my bases, I’m doing a straddle on SPX on a 1DTE. If I’m wrong and lose all my puts, the calls might help me break even. And if my puts hit, I won’t care about the call premium. (Neutral markets? Theta crushes me like a sad ant.) I am sure there is some math that says I am doing it wrong. I will pick up a **call on SPX ATM** towards the end of the day.

**Sidenote:**

I’m stuck holding **puts on DJT** until it plummets. My DJT calls already paid off, so whatever I get out of those puts is pure profit at this point. As a put on TSLA, because screw them.

I’ve been slowly building these positions over time (which is a very stupid strategy), and it’s been a rough week. As a rainbow bear, I’ve been getting punished while theta eats me alive. So here’s a little loss porn for your enjoyment as well to show current positions. If doesn't work out, I am doing ""no options February""...

Edit: Positions didn't come through. (My regards.)

2025-01-14,19:57:27,wallstreetbets,NBIS - Picks & Shovels but make it AI,"TL:DR :

* Company makes infrastructure for AI workloads at extremely impressive efficiency levels. Proprietary configuration for GPU clusters (first in NA to complete in Q1), has efficiency levels and compute performance beyond that of Tesla's latest creation, which NVDA Jensen said described as remarkable. Tip of the iceberg
* $700 mil invested by NVIDIA, who is supplying H100 Hopper GPUs for their cluster models with the first being constructed in KC, with plans to integrate Blackwell GPU H2 2025.
* Minimal debt totaling $27mil with a near $2bil in cash, $1bil+ planned infrastructure development in 25', with ARR forecast of $750m-1b

Primary focus is not some unremarkable data processing system that every SV chump and his grandma are pushing down throats. Nebius was sitting on some already profitable infrastructure in Finland and decided they could expand, replicate and improve across Europe and North America.

They were able to secure listing on the NASDAQ, and quickly obtained a $700 mil investment from Nvidia. Contrary to the few posts from your normal run of the mill bullshit like Motley fool etc..., this part on it's own is actually meaningless. Companies the size on Nvidia throw hail mary's at startups all the time and don't blink when they fail. However, in the context of their lofty development goals, this was their entry point to securing the hardware they needed to succeed, of which there is a finite supply.

Nebius plans to house 35,000 GPU's upon completion of the KC facility (20,000 by year end), utilizing the latest and incredibly efficient NVIDIA H200 GPUs

Alongside this, their facility in Finland is getting an overhaul and expansion, and a new facility will be constructed in Paris.

This is early days, P/S incredibly low in the peer group, which is insane considering the ridiculous multiples on all of the other shit doing nothing in this space. Industry trends are a massive tail wind. If they stay true to growth projections it's only a matter of time before it balloons, and Q1 is an excellent test of their reliance and ability to meet targets.

They received their first buy rating today from some garage shop trying to play wallstreet dress-up, but institutional money is going to be eyeing this closely, and they have an added advantage of their global footprint for managers looking to reposition this far into the secular bull.

As far as revenue goes, they reported $43 million in Q3 2024. They anticipate ARR to surpass $700 mil by year end. If we want to keep valuations reasonable relative to peers, this company should be valued well above 15 billion by year end, making a $65 share price entirely reasonable as the market plays catch-up.

While searching for appropriate contracts, I discovered zero liquidity on every prominent strike from this week until 2027. On Jan 9th open interest spiked an hour into close across most 40, 45, and 50 strikes. Begun building a position here and will continue to do so as I raise cash.

2025-01-14,15:47:41,wallstreetbets,New research note from Damo: Up to 100% bullish on Tesla to $800!,"Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target on Tesla from $400 to $430 (8.93% bullish vs. current price) and set a new bullish scenario valuation of $800 (100% bullish vs. current price). The stock index increase was primarily driven by Tesla's progress in self-driving car (AV) technology and its integration of embedded AI. ,

The report notes that Tesla's unique combination of expertise in data collection, robotics, energy storage, and AI/computing infrastructure puts it at the forefront of the emerging self-driving mobility market.

The analysts emphasize the role of Tesla's Travel Services division, the company's self-driving carpooling business, which is valued at $90 per share in a revised sum-of-the-parts valuation (SOTP) model. The travel services fleet size is expected to grow to 7.5 million vehicles by 2040, with projected revenue per mile of $1.46 and EBITDA margins of 29%。

  
Morgan Stanley also emphasized the growing importance of Tesla's Network Services, which covers recurring revenue streams such as Fully Self-Driving (FSD), Supercharging, and software upgrades.

The network services division is expected to contribute about one-third of Tesla's total EBITDA by 2030, with that percentage rising to nearly 60% by 2040. The Network Services division is currently valued at $168 per share, reflecting its growing importance in Tesla's business model.

We are raising our price target to $430 from the previous $400, an adjustment driven by increased valuation of travel services and network services, partially offset by lower valuation of the third-party battery business,” the analysts wrote.

They note that Tesla has a lot of potential in embedded AI, including opportunities in aerospace, marine, and other areas, though these have not yet been factored into this valuation.



Analysts expect Tesla's fleet of unmanned self-driving cars to debut in urban environments by 2026. However, in their Tesla Travel Services forecast, self-driving cars are not expected to achieve mass deployment until after 2030.

While self-driving policy may be reassessed at the national level once a new administration takes office, the analysts added that Tesla still faces 'significant hurdles' in overcoming the technical, testing and licensing challenges associated with near-term commercialization.

The updated bullish scenario of $800 per share assumes a fleet size of 12 million vehicles by 2040, revenues of $1.50 per mile, and EBITDA margins of 45%. This scenario foresees strong international expansion and greater pricing power.

On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's bearish scenario is valued at $200 per share (49% bearish compared to the current price), reflecting potential headwinds such as stricter regulation and slow market expansion.

2025-01-11,16:25:18,wallstreetbets,What to do with the impending TikTok ban?,"If you were following the Supreme Court yesterday, the message was pretty clear: they’re unlikely to step in and reverse PAFACA to save TikTok. Without their intervention, the only way for Trump to save TikTok would be through lobbying Congress to change legislation—executive orders alone won’t cut it. While META (Instagram Reels) and GOOG (YouTube Shorts) might see some short-term benefit, I’m betting that ILLR/ILLRW will be the biggest winner in the long run. Their low share price, combined with the potentially massive impact on their business, positions them perfectly to fill the TikTok-shaped gap in the market. With their leadership under Sean Kim and their ability to replicate much of TikTok’s experience, Triller could be the closest thing to a true replacement.

Sean Kim, the former Head of Product at TikTok, is now leading Triller as its CEO, and his vision for the platform couldn’t come at a better time. Kim was instrumental in developing TikTok’s groundbreaking algorithm and monetization system, two features that made TikTok the platform of choice for content creators. Now at Triller, he’s leveraging that expertise to build a platform designed to empower creators with similar (and potentially improved) tools for content discovery and revenue generation. This week, Triller launched a new app that helps creators seamlessly migrate their TikTok content directly to Triller, signaling a bold move to capture creators and their audiences amidst the uncertainty surrounding TikTok’s future.

With TikTok potentially banned in the U.S. as early as next week, platforms like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels will likely see an influx of users. However, creators and audiences will quickly notice these platforms are more censored and lack the strong monetization systems they’ve come to expect. That leaves Triller perfectly positioned to fill the gap. By offering a less restrictive environment and a focus on creator earnings, Triller has the tools, leadership, and timing to become the go-to alternative. Beyond the app, Triller’s other solutions add even more value: TrillerTV offers live-streamed content including influencer-driven shows and sports events like Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, while its AI-driven Brain Suite provides creators with data and tools to optimize content performance and grow their audiences. Together, these features create a robust ecosystem for creators to thrive.

Right now, Triller’s stock (ILLR) is trading around $2.50, with its warrants (ILLRW) available at an even lower cost, offering leveraged upside for investors willing to take a chance. Buying both the stock and the warrants could be a strategic move for those betting on Triller’s success. With its combination of innovative leadership, a creator-first approach, and diversified offerings like TrillerTV and Brain Suite, Triller presents a unique opportunity to capitalize on the rapidly changing social media landscape. For investors, the potential upside is hard to ignore.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2025-01-11,07:01:35,wallstreetbets,The beginning of a Bear Market,"Since the beginning of 2025, the market has been crashing and in fact in started in December of 2024

Watching the history of the VIX we are currently at the beginning of a cyclical and with the turn of events lately, we are set for a real turn in the market by the beginning to end of next week. Short Term ETF VIXY 50MA is about to test the 200MA. Tesla vehicles being recalled and EV sales down down. BoFA no longer sees rate cuts coming in the upcoming years. Blackrock is almost down 10% so far. Yields are up. California is on fire, and in big trouble with the 2nd biggest city economy in the world threatened to be burned down. The busiest freeway in the world is shutting down due to these fires happening and on the lowend earlier today, the costs were estimated to be 20+ billion USD. If the fire does not stop by the end of this weekend the costs could effectively cost California over $1.5 Trillion. Power will be shutoff temporarily for the surrounding areas around LA causing for concerns for public safety. Bankruptcies are definitely expected to increase and while the politics and worldwide conflicts take over the media this upcoming week, LA is at risk of going up in smoke. 

All this being said, it is already the most devastating fire in US history and people will lose their home over a force of nature. As of the time of this post, only 8% has been contained so far. Be prepared and be ready as the market has already  shown signs of cracks and will create issues in the upcoming months.

1. Meta - TikTok Ban 

I’ve posted a deeper dive into this but this event has been discounted and has huge ramifications on many sections of the market. I’ve posted my positions mods 👀

Please feel free to also discuss your thoughts on these trends too!",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2025-01-08,03:11:00,wallstreetbets,Meta ⭐️5,"Playing the TikTok ban. Posting for the 4th time….
  
¥\~Previous Events  
  
=They posted beautiful numbers during earnings but Mark started talking about bad AI numbers and the market panicked a bit.   
=The market was digesting Meta's insane comeback anyway. They need something big to impress outside of expected large ad numbers.   
= 3-0 unanimous decision by an appeals court decision to uphold Tiktok ban in December 
  
¥\~Present   
  
What about if one of their competitors vanishes overnight? We are playing the TikTok ban. This canon event is being heavily discounted.  
  
It's down to nine people after that it cannot be changed. Trump submitted the amicus brief as this will be the last chance he could stop the ban without getting into some serious issues with his chosen board and Congress with both sides supporting the bill. With everything else that's on his plate, I believe Trump will call a spade a spade and will look into it and say he tried. He's already got the election win from Tiktok he doesn't need it as much and with Zuck now onside he can still push what he needs to push. The moves.   
  
This is down to nine people and how they see national security. I've read up on the defense and prosecution legal appeals from before the original appeals trial (160 pages) and the US DOJ has an incredibly strong case, which is why the appeals court voted 3-0.   
  
Each judge has a different view on amendments and their importance vs national security however we can base from the previous judges arguments that this is quite open and shut as three judges reached the same conclusion with two judges differing on the interpretation but arriving at the same conclusion.  
  
If this goes through...it will get bigger than the initial 10% gain with the appeals decision. It will create a rally at which point there'll be many spots to take profit. The longer this ban stays in place the more of a rally Meta will gain (Snapchat, Google, possibly Reddit, too) but we bet on the big horse first.  
  
The ad dollars on offer are gonna get carved up like a prize beast and these ad companies are going to add the spoils to their market cap.  
  
Here are my estimates for possible results based on everything with 5-4 enough to uphold the ban.  
  
5-4 Stay/Strike down  
5-4 Uphold   
6-3 Uphold   
7-2 Uphold  
  
My prediction: 6-3 Uphold   
  
¥\~Future - Guidance/Event  
  
Facebook delivered great numbers and good guidance except for AI comments. However, this quarter they'll be carving up a big slice of the ad pie.   
  
Creatives: So quick admission I used to work in social advertising years ago and the creatives as they are known are the images and videos used for a digital advert and they come locked into certain aspect ratios and formats. This means companies that have locked in months of creatives from agencies will have to move their TikTok ads somewhere the format works. Snap, Google, and of course Meta (Big Horse)  
  
Facebook's ad budget: Is going to swell and we all know that the catalyst will be continuing the rally when they announce earnings in Early February.   
  
¥\~Key Dates = January 10th, January 19th, January 20th  
  
¥\~Risks to thesis = Ban does not go through - This is a binary event, the probabilities are high that it will go through but it is always possible it does not.
  
¥\~Checks = Last appeals decision Meta went up 10% in the lead-up to the appeals decision although this was not the final decision so this has the potential to rise further.  
  
¥\~Long-term potential = Once the vote goes through will re-up and hold medium/longer-term options.

Sorry the format sucks lol.

As you can see, the Oligarch Index has currently outperformed the S&P 500 by 30% since the election. Some of the companies like Ford which would benefit from protectionism haven't even shot up yet. Plenty of room for growth!  

I really dgaf about how you feel about politics, if you don’t want to make money, that’s on you babe. Remember it’s not corruption if it’s legal! Tariff exemptions aren’t cheap! 

Of course as always some of the bribes—I mean donations—are by individuals who invest above our normie level like Sam Altman or Citadel hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, Timothy Mellon (yes the old school oligarch Mellon! I told you they’re making a come back!), Florida Crystals, or Pratt Industries if you don’t like that, well, try to stop corrupt people from becoming president! In the mean time, profit as much as you can! If you think I missed any, put it in the comments!

2025-01-06,21:33:24,wallstreetbets,The current U.S. stock market valuation has reached 2000 and 2021 levels.  Will this time be different?,"Three different U.S. stock market valuation models (the Buffett Indicator, CAPE ratio, and Mean Reversion Model - three different ways of objectively looking at the overall valuation of the current market) are flashing extreme overvaluation warning signs that were both last seen in 2000 and 2021.  Both 2000 and 2021 marked market euphoria highs, and bear markets followed.  You can make all your jokes that you want about gay bears successfully calling 420 of the last 69 recessions or what not, but the undeniable fact is that the track record of these three valuation models showing ""strongly overvalued"" in unison is 2 for 2 in ""calling"" bear markets that followed very quickly.  Will history repeat itself again?  Or is this time different (i.e. - valuations continue to ""not matter"" for longer)?

[Buffett Indicator \(ratio of U.S. stocks total market cap to GDP\) - Strongly overvalued \(2 standard deviations above historical trendline\).  Just like it was in 2000 and 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/gngm7i231abe1.jpg?width=1680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e03e76ec35654e8eea252751c28f6684f66ae4e)

\-

[Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings \(CAPE\) Ratio - Also strongly overvalued.  Tied with 2021, but a bit less \\""deviant\\"" than it was in 2000.](https://preview.redd.it/pvwgetg1w9be1.jpg?width=1664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca3c67e0787a248277f1b620ed01bed7281a69ca)

\-

[S&P 500 Mean Reversion Model - Strongly overvalued - tied with 2000 and 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/4uxqj2gxz9be1.jpg?width=1662&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25951a195b5363c0b4476b25963d206e5d51d7f0)

There is also a fourth model - the Interest Rate Model, which measures S&P 500 valuation relative to current 10-year treasury rate.  It hasn't quite hit the ""strongly overvalued"" line (it didn't in 2021 either), but it is pretty close to it.

[Interest Rate Model - Not quite to the \\""strongly overvalued\\"" red line, but close.  Lower than it was in 2000, but higher than it was in 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/32sl4e1o4abe1.jpg?width=1660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dedfffde7edc549734c8c0747c3e3356ceba79bb)

Two recession risk models - Yield Curve Inversion and the Sahm Rule - may be signaling a rough time as well.

[Yield Curve - The 10-Year to 3-Month treasury spread, after big and long inversion, looks like it may be uninverting now.  Historically, recessions or bear markets followed soon after the uninversion.](https://preview.redd.it/iuek8qe66abe1.jpg?width=1651&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b11f04747d4069dc6305dbe7d8a631243308b2b8)

\-

[Sahm Rule value - a measure of the current 3-month moving average of unemployment compared to the prior 12-month low of that same stat.  It poked just above the red line, then retreated a bit.  Right now it is kind of in \\""Will it or won't it?\\"" mode.](https://preview.redd.it/hjkkkzdt8abe1.jpg?width=1673&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0151bc58c63c00c2c482642dc2df0f2be53e2173)

\-

There is also the Fed Funds Rate. It is showing a similar setup to previous cycles of rate hikes, followed by rate holds, followed by rate cuts, followed by recession.  The current setup looks similar to 2007-2008 especially.  Will the recession or bear market be cancelled this time with ""mission accomplished - soft landing achieved""?

[Fed Funds Rate - 2007-2008 looks pretty similar to now.](https://preview.redd.it/1w999tosaabe1.jpg?width=1715&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f016a2cda57106d33d7f0b85e303a8199bdb4d6f)

Here is the inflation-adjusted S&P 500 on a log scale chart.  It has historically gone through a series of ""hot"" periods where the market beats inflation for roughly 15 years (give or take a few years), followed by ""cold"" periods where the market loses to inflation that last 10 years (give or take a few years).  The magnitude and time length of the current ""hot"" period looks like it could be giving way to a ""cold"" period soon if the overall historical cycle is followed.

[Inflation adjusted S&P 500 - Are we entering a cooling period soon?](https://preview.redd.it/p82of78idabe1.jpg?width=977&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da3a49111a2c512564846f330f2053baaa628f2c)

Last but not least, I'll list a few informal ""Can't you just feel it it in the room?"" type ""blow-off top"" indicators of a potential market top:

1. Tesla stock doubled in price in like 1-2 months on shallow narratives not backed by numbers.  An insane $750 billion market cap to an even more insane $1.5 trillion market cap in 1-2 months on a company earning roughly $13 billion annually (132 P/E ratio right now) and not growing much anymore.  Ludicrous.  Earnings have not exploded in line with stock price, not nearly at all.  I don't care what you TSLA lovers say - your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth.
2. Palantir stock also doubled in price in like 1-2 months, also on shallow narratives not backed by numbers.  Roughly $100 billion to $180 billion market cap with a price-to-SALES ratio going from an insane 30x to an even more insane 67x.  Ludicrous.  And I don't care what you PLTR lovers say - your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth.
3. *\[Removing this point from discussion because AutoMod thought I was breaking rule #8, even though I wasn't.  I pasted it down in the comments section* [*HERE*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hv91vx/comment/m5ssco9/)*.\]*
4. Just the mentality of too many market participants buying ponzi-scheme like assets or money-burning trash companies at all in general, often knowingly.  Like, seriously, why is this even a thing?  What the fuck is wrong with this market?  This shouldn't be happening... like, at all.
5. The great momentum chase of 2024. The theme of the year was to just bid up and crowd into the most popular meme-like line-go-up assets, regardless of fundamentals.  It went into over-drive in November/December, to the point of self-parody.  It has a very end-stage bull market feeling to it.
6. The great AI hype.  Does the potential future of AI justify many of these extreme valuations?  Maybe, but I'm not convinced that there's much upside left near-term.  The only companies making serious money from this so far are Nvidia and the handful of companies selling the AI hardware to other companies that are speculating on it.  And the once rapid progression in generative AI chatbots, picture generators, and video generators seen in 2023 and early 2024 seems to have slowed and hit a bit of a wall in the second half of 2024.

TL;DR - All the warning signs of extreme overvaluation and an incoming bear market are there.  Unlike most other gay bear posts that usually just show one ""warning sign"" chart to make a case, I showed you multiple charts, along with multiple observations.  Whether you choose to ignore them or not depends on how long you think the market will choose to ignore them or not.

Positions: (1) Bent over a table.  (2) Puts on TSLA, PLTR, MSTR, and some other 2024 momentum clown stocks for 2025. Contemplating whether to inverse or to inverse my inverse.

Update: 1/7 Pre-market - I have taken down the screenshot of my tentative positions from 1/6, because I will be closing some of them and changing some things around.  For archival purposes, you may view my original 1/6 positions [here](https://i.imgur.com/J0orM1x.jpeg).

Update: 1/6 7:00PM EST - Cramer on his closing segment on ""Mad Money"" just said ""I think Palantir and Tesla stock are DEFINITELY going higher.""  Take that for what you will.  I know the meme is to inverse Cramer, but he does end up being right short-term a number of times, so it doesn't really make me any more confident in my puts.",TSLA,Tesla

2025-01-06,12:55:55,wallstreetbets,"""New"" Volkswagen Leaks ","Alright degenerates, strap in because this is why Volkswagen might just be the juiciest short of 2025. Spoiler alert: this makes Dieselgate look like a warmup.

My Position: Just opened a -0,4 Delta 80€ put on Volkswagen (Vz.) for 5000 € expiring 19th June 26.

The Chaos Computer Club just (27.12.24) just revealed that Volkswagen (and its subsidiaries Audi, Seat, Skoda) exposed the real-time locations of *800,000 EVs*. That's right – anyone with basic skills could pinpoint where your $40k EV is parked, plus grab your name and contact info. VW literally left their cars and customers wide open for anyone to exploit. Volkswagen’s software arm, Cariad, stored all this sensitive data on Amazon Web Services without proper encryption or safeguards. Let me say that again: **no encryption in 2025.** That's amateur hour for a company that sells millions of cars. Oh, and this isn’t the first time VW screwed the pooch on tech; their software track record is *garbage.*

*Here is the link to their video:* [*https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-wir-wissen-wo-dein-auto-steht-volksdaten-von-volkswagen#l=eng&t=0*](https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-wir-wissen-wo-dein-auto-steht-volksdaten-von-volkswagen#l=eng&t=0)

**Why This Is Bigger Than Dieselgate**  
Dieselgate cost Volkswagen over $30 billion in fines, lawsuits, and buybacks. But that was *emissions*. This? This is **personal data** – names, locations, potential stalking targets and members of the BND. We’re living in the post-GDPR era, where the EU doesn’t play nice with data breaches. Fines for mishandling data can be as high as 4% of annual global turnover, which for VW could mean billions. Plus, the reputational damage.

**There has not yet been a Market reaction to the release of this video.**

Also want to give you some reasons why you should not take my advice and short VW:

* Volkswagen is the biggest EV player in Europe with about 25% market share. European people don’t trust Chinese vehicles, and they don’t trust Elon Musk.
* VW is grossly undervalued compared to Tesla. We’re talking €44 billion market cap vs. €1,279 billion for Tesla. VW currently earns those €44 billion every four years.
* CCC did responsible disclosure, and VW already fixed the breach. It will be hard to prove harm done to you.
* The German state is highly invested in VW
* EU regulations require automakers to collect and process vast amounts of data to comply with emissions standards, safety protocols, and EV monitoring. The breach highlights shortcomings, but some responsibility lies with the regulatory framework.

2025-01-05,03:51:43,wallstreetbets,Lost 18000 in 2 months,"Edit: people seem to be misunderstanding my post I mainly intend to do paper trading until I can get my skills to be a bit better. The goal is just to understand the market more.

Well to tell my tale I should start by saying I have been investing for a while. Started with penny stocks with 2k, dwindled it 0. And then put it in long term in 2022 and made a shit ton on nvda, meta and few other stocks. 

At some point I started observing NVDA closely and also got indocrtianted to options. So during the earnings in May/June 2023, I put 7k into NVDA on an OTM contract, made shit ton. And then lost a shit ton on other earning plays and made everything and a bit more on AVGO a month later, making my net worth 48k. 

48k is pre crazy, and I made some dumb trades and eventually got that close to 0. And to get everything back quickly I pumped 6k more, and pretty soon lost it all. While I am working and this is my savings this doesn't in anyway affect my daily life. But it hurts my ego quite a bit. 

I wanted to do more revenge trading, but losing 18k puts things into perspective, so I decided maybe not doing what I am doing is probably something to consider.

Since September I have been just looking at charts and reading patterns, and I have basically gotten good at reading NVDA to a certain extent. And over the last month (since early dec) I invested another $1000 and I am on a goal to make it to $18,000. Which I have done well with and its close to $2500. 

But I realize I need to be able to understand and learn a bit more about the market to scale this, and have a better idea on when to do what.

So I am coming with a plan for myself to kind of understand the basics, so far what I have in the pipeline to look into:

1. What really is a stock, what dictates its movement?
2. Understand what the many stats you see in we bull/fin viz and etc about a stock and how they affect a stock. (Not sure how to correlate them, but that's part of the challenge)
3. Look into observable and recurring patterns I can take advantage of:
   1. Trying to make a quick buck out of IV dropping post earnings.
   2. See indicators of what make the market move up.
   3. Predicting if strong stocks can move the entire industry and if there are affiliates that move along side it to take advantage of unrealized gain from them.
   4. Understanding Options better, calls, puts, and selling them. And how the greeks affect them.

This is just me spitballing, but if anyone who has been successful with short term trading in the long term wants to give me tips, or any changes to what I have above or have resources to offer, I would very much appreciate it.

Now along side this I am a computer science grad so this is something of a side project to me, I am looking to see if I can build an app for myself mainly to see if I can emulate a time for any stock from months ago and let the stock move in real time but from a time you set into the past.

For example set NVDA to Jan 2nd 2025 at 9AM and watch it move second by second for practice with pattern analysis when doing weekly. Alongside that possible scrapping to see data from months ago and seeing if I can create something of a algo to predict stock movements from months as if it hasn't yet happened. 

Most of  the ideas are very unrefined but this is my honest effort to do better than the gambling I lost in. Any advice is appreciated.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

Could have held on for bigger gains as these options closed at $10 aka $1000 had I been a bit more aggressive but profits can disappear very quickly on 0dte options if the stock reverses.  First went to $2 and then back down to .65 cents... then rocketed back up to $2 and above.   Wish I hadn't sold any early on but who knew Tesla would be up 9% today.  Kinda figured Tesla was in for a reversal after it getting smoked for $100 from the ath few weeks ago and then the huge move down yesterday from delivery numbers.  But either way got a bit lucky with the overall market going up and didn't worry crazily about the position since it was such a small initial max  risk of $250.

Buying the calls at open is an important part of the strategy because I’m in Australia so when market open it’s 1030pm for me and I need to get to sleep at a reasonable hour. Some nights I sit outside smoking a cigarette or joint, just looking at the moon. Marvelling at its beauty. Then I see the faint green glow of the SPY chart in my periphery.

Got lucky as sold these risky options at the peak of TSLA a few weeks ago. I didn't analyze the Greeks or anything other than seeing that the price would have to go up considerably after an already huge run to lose money. 

My question is how can I retroactively analyze these to see what the Greeks looked like or what the conditions were that aligned with my intuition. 

Most likely this was just luck , but I'd like to get more into option selling to profit from theta/vega. 

These felt like absolutely free money and went positive immediately. 

My logic was that the stock was up 100% in a month. High vol, the company is clearly overvalued, and over 1 trillion in market cap.

If i could go back to my past self, i would say this. The loss isn't worth the potential gains. Before, I was just burnt out from my job. But at least i was proud to have saved up my first 100k. Now im burnt out, down 3 years of savings, and have a lot less freedom in my life.  I can't focus on work, i'm depressed and can't find joy in my hobbies anymore. I'm probably in the process of ruining my relationship as well. Even if i had won, i definitely don't think I'd be happier an equivalent amount. 

Life is hard. If you worked hard and earned some money. Dont make degenerate bets. The vast majority of us are just normal humans who should just save their time and invest in part index fund and part cash equivalents.

Or maybe this marks the bottom and it is a buying opportunity. Your choice. 

EDIT
Was only expecting maybe max 100 upvotes but i guess I said something that resonates. 

After wading through the comments, insults, memes, etc. I was touched by enough kind people reaching out to add some more. I dont think i can stomach another comment reading though so please dont expect me to react anymore. Notifications are off. Posted a 80k loss screenshot of part of my portfolio. Another 30k was lost in another account. https://imgur.com/a/jMvs9DR

1. ""only bet what you can afford to lose"" doesn’t really make sense. Dont use that saying to convince yourself to make risky gambles. I could afford to lose 110k in the sense that i won't starve, i would still have a roof over my head, and i still have 30k i left that i promised to myself i wouldnt touch. But i lost things i didn't expect. Like my passions for my hobbies, a healthy exercise habit, my mental health after recovering from depression during college. Even during the time i was trading, i also hated how it felt. I was glued to the ticker and was losing connection with real life relationships.  Before you use the money you think you are willing to lose. Try spending a part of that amount on yourself. Get yourself some luxuries, some experiences, maybe travel, take a sabbatical from work, or spend it on someone close to you.  Its all numbers on the screen when trading, so its easy to lose a sense of it all. Afterwards, imagine losing the ability to do all that and only proceed if youre ok with that. 

2. For those who think this isnt something a normal person could go through. I saved roughly 60-70% of my paycheck the past 3 years. I made sacrifices on lifestyle and luxuries. 

3. For those that still want to go on, i sure cant stop you. Maybe some of us need to learn a lesson firsthand. Might be better even to learn early on before you have a family with hundreds of thousands saved up over decades. This might help. 

Looking back, i definitely had chances to make money.  I was thinking about RKLB when it was $5 (now $25). I had a chance to jump into RDDT when it was still $80. I considered googl at 165 since the bad news seemed overblown.   Even at my most insane already down 50k, before i lost it all i almost went all in in on christmas eve with 1 week dte options on tsla calls.  Instead i did it on the Friday afterwards hoping for a similar bounce to recover the from the drop after fed earnings.  If you get into single stocks, crypto, options it's a lot riskier. Youre going to have to be lucky with the timing. Youre also going to have to be disciplined with your strategy.  

When you make your bet. If you win, stop.  i hope you become happy. I hope you get more time to pursue your passions. To spend time with family and friends. To become a person you are proud of. 

If you lose, i hope you recover. Never gamble again. Life will be harder. But, maybe we can still find a part of that happiness. I dont think we really want money. We just want a more human experience. ",TSLA,Tesla

2024-12-27,16:18:54,wallstreetbets,"NVIDIA's GPU monster is about to come out of the cage, and today's prices will be its starting point.","The Nvidia Blackwell B300 series processors excel in a number of ways that make them an important breakthrough in AI, big data, and hyperscale computing:



1. Dramatic Performance Improvements

The B300 series delivers a 50% increase in compute performance over the B200 series. This performance increase is not only achieved through more compute cores and higher clock frequencies, but also through a more optimized 4NP process (Nvidia's custom 4nm process). For applications that need to process complex AI models, the B300 delivers more efficient computing power, especially in the areas of machine learning, deep learning and high-performance computing.



2. Extra memory and bandwidth

The B300 is equipped with a 12-Hi HBM3E memory stack providing 288GB of memory and 8TB/s of bandwidth. The increased memory capacity enables it to handle larger datasets, making it particularly suitable for training large language models (LLMs) and handling long sequence inference tasks. Higher memory bandwidth accelerates data access and processing, reduces latency, and improves model inference and training efficiency.



3. Lower inference cost

Since the B300 supports processing larger batches and extended sequence lengths, it significantly reduces latency in the inference process and lowers inference costs. For example, the ability to triple inference efficiency allows the full computational power of each GPU to be utilized, thus reducing the cost required to generate the number of tokens per second.



4. Innovative interconnect technology

The B300 utilizes the 800G ConnectX-8 NIC, which provides twice the bandwidth of its predecessor for large-scale clusters and supports more PCIe lanes (48 instead of 32). This enables more efficient data sharing across multiple GPUs, significantly improving overall cluster throughput and computing efficiency, making it ideal for large-scale distributed and cloud computing applications.



5. More flexible supply chain and customization

Nvidia has changed its traditional sales model by no longer supplying complete server hardware, but instead offering core components such as SXM Puck modules and Grace CPUs to OEMs and ODMs, allowing customers to customize them according to their needs. This change brings higher flexibility and scalability to better adapt to the needs of different enterprises, especially for hyperscale data centers and cloud computing vendors, where customization can improve overall performance and efficiency.



6. Higher Scalability

For hyperscale organizations, the B300's NVLink 72 (NVL72) architecture enables 72 GPUs to collaborate on the same problem with low latency. Compared to traditional 8 GPU configurations, the B300 significantly improves batch size scalability, reduces costs and increases the intelligence of the inference chain. This makes the B300 computationally and economically efficient for large-scale inference tasks.



7. Efficient Cooling and Energy Management

Although the power consumption of the B300 series has increased (TDP of 1,400W), the B300 is able to dynamically allocate and adjust power between the CPU and GPU to maximize overall energy efficiency, thanks to a more efficient dynamic power allocation mechanism. Additionally, its design allows for a more efficient water cooling system, which helps reduce operating costs and improve system stability.



Value Proposition

Improved Computing Efficiency: The B300 Series is capable of handling larger datasets and more complex AI models, making it suitable for organizations that require high-performance computing, such as those in the areas of deep learning, inference services, large-scale AI model training, and other applications.

Reduced inference costs: With higher memory capacity and bandwidth, the B300 significantly reduces the cost per inference and improves economics, which is a huge value-add for cloud providers or organizations offering AI services.

Flexible customization: Nvidia's new supply chain model enables organizations to choose the most appropriate hardware configuration for their needs, reducing overall procurement costs and increasing flexibility.

Underpinning Hyperscale Computing: The B300 is a significant technology upgrade for data centers, cloud giants, and other hyperscale computing platforms (e.g., Amazon, Google, Meta), helping them scale compute capacity more efficiently and improve performance.



In summary, the B300 series not only brings significant improvements in multiple aspects such as performance, memory, bandwidth, and energy management, but also provides greater adaptability and scalability through a flexible supply chain and customized design, helping enterprises achieve higher efficiency and lower operating costs in large-scale computing and AI applications.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

If you genuinely bought that stock that shall not be named, you should actually buy BROS since you've likely been donating to the market for years anyway 

**Less Blondes, More “WTF is that thing that took my order?”**

When I first started going to Dutch Bros, every morning was basically a softcore caffeine porno. 10/10 baristas smiling at you, making your day less miserable before you go back to being a wage cuck at whatever bs remote job you do. Now I show up and I’m greeted by some purple haired thing named Skylar. The amount of rainbow employees i've been seeing at different locations has made me gag, If I genuinely wanted a questionable gender-fluid experience, I’d just invest in coins again. Now I just go to $SBUX to get served by underpaid but a cute WOMAN. idc what you say, you can’t put a P/E on “no boner, no brew.” 

**Healthier Options = Brain Activity = Lost Sales** 

look, I go to Dutch Bros because I want 500 grams of sugar in a single gulp. I’m not here to think about the caloric content of my caramel macchi-whatever-the-fuck. Studies (these are harvard studies if you cucks wanna try and question me) show that when you force customers to think, you lose money. Give me my diabetes-in-a-cup and let me die happy. Also who the fuck buys a protein coffee, get a grip .

**Competition is Thiccker than a Nikola motors truck** 

Expansion is a bitch when you’re trying to out-coffee Starbucks, Dunkin’, and every bearded hipster in a food truck. You really think $BROS can find prime corners in big cities when SBUX has already claimed every intersection and half the alleyways? Good luck with that. They might as well set up shop in the middle of bumfuck iowa at least they’ll have a monopoly there.

**Real Estate: From Tiny Shacks to Big-Ass Buildings**

The beauty of Dutch Bros was their huts—little shacks that cost roughly the same as an average tiny 3d printed home. Now I’m seeing thicker stores with actual indoor/outdoor seating, meaning sky-high overhead. 

If you're regarded: More real estate = more capital expenses = less margin. you start letting customers inside, and guess what? They might linger, think about what they’re buying and worst of all might even realize they can just make their own coffee at home like a finance guru on  youtube

**Expansion Costs & Financial Fuckery**

Yea yea $BROS wants to open 1,500 stores in the next decade. Each new location can cost up to \~$1M in capex (im sure ur all have finance degrees and know what this means). With an average check size that barely pays your rent (assuming you ever move out of your mom’s basement) or even covers a 3d printed house , that’s a metric shit-ton of $9 coffees just to break even.Meanwhile, $SBUX is sitting on every corner, flexing their global supply chain and brand recognition. And where are the profits?? Last quarter, $BROS had a net loss of around $16 million while “expanding.” Their operating margin makes my match rate on hinge look good. Their P/S ratio implies theyre the TSLA of coffee, but let’s face it they can only dream of . To add onto this their new CEO looks more bullish on $MCD than she is on $BROS, christin barron if you're reading this: sign up for equinox, get you some $PTON, and maybe ill buy some of your shares.

The only bullish thing is that their CEO is a whale (and not the kind that buys shares) meaning she probably buys her own produce 

**TL;DR: if you hate skinny women, love to lose money or both. buy $BROS**

Marco Iachini, senior vice president of research at Vanda, said, “NVIDIA's stock price has risen so spectacularly that it has stolen the limelight from Tesla.”



　　



NVIDIA has been favored by investors large and small over the past year or so. Last month, NVIDIA officially joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average and was the top performer among the index's 30 components. Despite slightly volatile trading in December, NVIDIA is still on track to realize a gain of more than 180% by the end of 2024. Today, its market capitalization has surpassed $3 trillion, making it the second-largest U.S. company by market capitalization, behind Apple.



　　



NVIDIA's retail investor position has also increased significantly. According to Vanda's data, NVIDIA's weighting in retail portfolios has risen from 5.5% earlier this year to more than 10%. Currently, NVIDIA is the second-largest position for retail investors, behind Tesla. This year, net inflows of retail money into NVIDIA are up more than 885% from three years ago.

Who cares how I did it if you’re losing, you should stop and start thinking but anyways here’s my current play. Don’t do what I’m doing as I have other investments apart from those high risk high reward.


When you are pushed in a corner, you must study read listen watch countless of hours, and I promise you will make it through

Warning : I am heavily invested  in high risk ETFS  I wil name them bellow . I started accumulating this week. 

All Roads lead to Rome; 

In the short term, all signs point to strong returns, driven by America’s economic exceptionalism. I expect significant gains by early or mid-2025 from the following positions:

ETF=TNA (3x Small Cap).

ETF= UDOW (3x Dow).

ETF= FAS (3x Financials).

ETF= 3x Bull ETF ether ETHU

Why not by the end of the year?
A market correction in the early or mid part of 2025 is a real possibility, which is why I’m positioning for the short term gains 

A Key Reminder from a Legendary Investor:
One of the most respected fixed-income investors of all time—whom Warren Buffett sought advice from—Mark Howard’s once said:

“The market can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”
You may think the market is overpriced, but the premium you’re paying for American stocks is justified because the U.S. is the world’s greatest economy.

Keep in mind this is from someone that does not invest a penny in securities or seldom does and continues to buy bonds when the 2008 crash occurred he was considered one of the smartest since his portfolio barely took a hit and made billions upon billions afterwards.

He greatly reminds us that investing is a losers game, and predicting the future is not possible


On  that  note you can for certain know that whatever what happened in the past 
 is not a good indication of future Performance , but you can be certain that you can analyze today and today is American economic exceptionalism

For dummies this means that there is no greater economy, American exceptionalism was a political word used by the early settlers. Almost every president uses it but today you are actually living it . A beacon light upon a hill, in which the eyes of the world is set up on us, an example to the world.

I have a minor in political science -once I thought it would be useless  to study . I did for fun 


What I Know for Sure:
While I can’t predict what will happen tomorrow, here’s what I can say about today:

**Job Market**

There’s never been a better time to find a job. Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and younger generations aren’t filling those gaps. With immigration restrictions tightening, job openings will continue to rise.

**Interest Rates & Inflation**

Whether rates go up, down, or stay the same, any shift is just an opportunity to buy. Despite inflation, GDP growth will likely outpace any downturns. All signs point to a strong American economy.

**Political Environment:**

The new administration may bring volatility and media distractions, but over time, you’ll get used to it.  And the market will get use to it , in fact it will become almost meaningless . 
As long as the economy remains strong, those disruptions won’t matter.


**Final Thought from Warren Buffett:**
In Buffett’s words, America is like a train that keeps moving forward, picking up more passengers along the way. Occasionally, it may get derailed or need to stop, but it will always get back on track and keep moving forward.

You will never know why he sold yet , is it because his age ? is it because he actually believes at the market is overvalued ? if so, he would have listen to Mark Howard’s in his recent interview I believe it is more of a shifting of strategy plus or minus his given age and his future holdings not a reflection of what he believes about the American economy

Right now, tech companies are only buying Nvidia's chips to get started and build market share, because they do not want to fall behind their competition. 

Using Nvidia's chips at current prices is not profitable, even successful AI companies such as OpenAI fail to achieve positive operating margins despite a highly popular product with paid features. Large tech companies are reluctantly buying Nvidia's hardware to avoid falling behind their competition in market share.

It demonstrates that any AI company that can cut out Nvidia can significantly reduce their costs, and that's why everyone is building their own chips. They don't need to be faster than Nvidia to succeed, they just need to be fast enough to provide services at a lower cost, which is quite a low bar.

Nvidia is following in Intel's footsteps with their $50 Billion stock buyback plan at 50x earnings.

This will be their downfall. They are not hedging their reliance on TSMC by seeking to acquire or develop their own fab business, they are not increasing R&D sufficiently to stay ahead of their competition.

2024-12-18,20:17:31,wallstreetbets,"Self-driving business grows 6x, Uber is clearly misplaced by the market and is on the verge of 50% upside","Shares of Uber ( NYSE: UBER ) have fallen more than 30% from their October 2024 highs in just a few weeks on concerns that self-driving cars could eliminate intermediary services:

https://preview.redd.it/ncqr7mkton7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5be5fc6a2808eb552fe5efa419afcff986c0b184

While news such as Google's Waymo skipping Uber to enter the self-driving cab business in Miami is thought-provoking enough to make some investors uneasy, Uber's positioning as the “transportation app for everyone” - an aggregator of all transportation needs for more than 160 million consumers - makes it an inevitable market platform for self-driving car companies. This makes it an inevitable market platform for self-driving car companies. Tesla and Google have deep pockets, but building a bilateral network of self-driving cabs from scratch would cost (and burn) tens of billions of dollars, take years to achieve scalable economics, and make it difficult to change customer behavior - despite the novelty of driverless cabs. Additionally, Uber has partnered with several AV providers to bring self-driving cabs to its platform:

https://preview.redd.it/i0vyye8yon7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f17b6075787a9b0dc4af67c37e0ebe7b6c46100c

From an economic standpoint, it makes more sense to partner with Uber as an AV supplier than to try to create demand on a new network of self-driving cabs with a limited and expensive AV fleet.



Now, in the past, Uber's leadership team has used self-driving cars as TAM extenders, which is the right thought process, as increased supply in the form of robo-taxis could potentially lower Uber's cost-per-mile, which in turn would push penetration and total bookings higher!

The growth of the self-driving car market will unfold over the next decade or two, so it seems premature to abandon Uber based on concerns about disintermediation. As long as Uber's business grows as planned, there's no reason to panic sell. On the contrary, Uber stock's recent decline has significantly improved its long-term risk/reward, with TQI's five-year expected compound annual growth rate for Uber jumping from \~16.1% to \~25.8%.



Based on forward-looking estimates, Uber's revenue will continue to grow at a healthy double-digit rate over the next five years:



https://preview.redd.it/y0bde0y4pn7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e92a4ff9d1b41574336c2d841cbb17ce75c5bdf

As a result, in today's valuation, the analysts are sticking with the growth and margin assumptions used in their previous assessment of Uber. That is, updating Uber's revenue base to $43.71 billion (2024 consensus revenue estimate) and updating the stock count to 2.154 billion shares. All other assumptions remain unchanged and relatively simple.

Based on the valuation model, Uber's fair value is approximately $105.50 per share, or currently undervalued by approximately 45%. In addition, given the sharp decline, Uber's long-term risk/reward has improved considerably. Given its 5-year expected compound annual growth rate is currently about 25.8% - well above our 15% investment threshold rate.



In a historically expensive stock market, Uber is now one of the few large tech stocks that offer amazing value!

https://preview.redd.it/1wyr2j2hpn7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94716206e12d6b22ee6b1f7abcb0115526bcf317

Uber is making every effort to become a reliable money-printing machine. Given Uber's fast-growing cash flow production and the shareholder-friendly capital allocation policies adopted by management, investors had plenty of margin of safety in this large tech stock.



Now, Uber stock is finally pulling back. Yes, Uber's image has been poor due to recent self-driving cab developments; however, Uber's business is in good shape with continued strong sales and profitability growth:

https://preview.redd.it/h06e8jinpn7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba2cf41a6dc09ec5267d660fe0b4693a62526151

In Q3 2024, Uber's total bookings increased 16% year-over-year to $40.97 billion, driven by healthy growth in MAPC \[up 13% year-over-year\] and MAPC usage frequency \[up 4% year-over-year\]. Additionally, Uber's cash conversion continued to improve at a rapid pace in Q3, with free cash flow increasing +133% year-over-year to $2.1 billion.

https://preview.redd.it/bmsuyee0qn7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d822979f73322203f554899b398941453619e7d9

From a technical perspective, Uber shares are above the 100-week moving average, which could be strong support. Additionally, the 200-week moving average is at $47. Given that Uber's weekly RSI is near oversold territory, the $47-$57 range is a strong buy zone for long-term investors.

**GOOG - like a wife on a Wednesday, she’s not going down.**

Alphabet isn’t just Google anymore—it’s the tech overlord running your life, your ads, and the YouTube rabbit holes you waste your life in.

1. While you drool over ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini is out here printing real money while your wife drives away with “Tim from finance”.

2. YouTube = Tendies from all ages: It’s monetizing both the Boomers and Gen Z eyeballs milking them for every cent.

3. Cloud Revenue 🚀 : Google Cloud is up **30%** YoY. They’re catching up to AWS and Azure like a freight train and THERE IS NO SAFE WORD!

4. Weymo, Tokyo, up-go, y’know?

5. It’s Not Even Overpriced (Yet): PE ~26. If you’re still crying that “Big Tech is expensive,” literally just shut the fuck up.

GOOG is a low-risk, high-reward tendie train for monkés who want to stop seeing ~~RED~~ their wife getting trained on the weekends.

**TSLA - The big-Brain Hedge You are still too Dumb to Consider**

Tesla is the most overvalued clown car on the market. It looks like shit, it’s priced like shit and the groupies make it sound like Musk just invented teleportation, cured baldness, and colonized Mars simultaneously. **Spoiler Alert! >!He didn’t!<.**

1. When the Market loses hype momentum, TSLA Gets Nuked ☠️ . Overvalued growth names like Tesla get slapped like a hookers cheeks behind Wendy’s, especially if JPow pulls the wrong face.

2. Buying OTM put spreads is a small cost to hedge your brainless GOOG upside. If TSLA drops 20%, you’re eating so many tendies you’ll need a stairmaster to get to bed.

**TLDR** **GOOG Calls** Buy it, hold it, shut up. It’s free money. **TSLA Put Spreads** Buy a cheap put spread. If the market slips, TSLA dumps, and you get paid.

If the market moons, GOOG wins. If the market dies, TSLA pays for your next YOLO. Either way, you’re not left high and dry like the rest of the regards here.

Don’t fumble this you fucking idiot.

I have a pretty big position in NVDA but am obviously not too thrilled with the stock performance since June.

While I am still bullish on NVIDIA and AI, there are a few things that make me pause

Apple doing its whole Apple Intelligence thing not planning to spend a single dollar with NVIDIA but rather building custom chips with Broadcom
Anthropic going all-in with Amazon's Trainium chips. In the past, big funding for AI startups meant a big check for Jensen. This didn't happen here and could set a precedent
Broadcom announcing that it will build 1 million XPU (ASIC) data centers with hyperscalers.
So while NVIDIA is clearly ahead of AMD, I don't like the shift to Broadcom ASIC chips. And to be honest it makes a lot of sense to me that Meta or Amazon would build their own chips to do stuff like recommendation engines.

2024-12-16,09:23:04,wallstreetbets,Tesla Bull and Bear case: the great AI and liability gamble,"Tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently, nearly doubling to $1.4T market cap in just three months. The catalyst is Trump’s victory and Elon Musk’s instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon’s influence to relax regulations, clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout—a potential game-changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole.

Tesla is trading like an AI startup, and for good reason: its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look.  


# The Bull Case: Tesla’s data volume

Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road, each equipped with a suite of cameras, Tesla’s fleet constantly collects real-world driving data. This data acts as a “shadow trainer” for its AI, gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile, FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI, providing Tesla with even more labeled data.

Behind the scenes, Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases—rare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly, Tesla’s massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume, which usually means better machine learning.On top of this, Tesla’s vision-only approach—using cameras without lidar—makes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result? A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world, not just pre-mapped areas.





# The Bear Case: Quantity vs. Quality

More data is not always better, and it’s possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments, where edge cases are relatively rare, while Waymo trains their AI in dense, chaotic urban areas.  The result is a more diverse dataset that’s constantly evolving.

Waymo is owned by Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar.  Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out, but failed, to do.  Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of, since it often conflicted with the vision data.  But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work.  This means that its data is much richer in quality.  The urban-focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla’s suburban-heavy dataset, giving its AI a potentially richer training environment.

The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre-mapped areas, Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real-world deployments today. Tesla, by comparison, is still at Level 2, which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn’t just an incremental step—it’s an order-of-magnitude leap in complexity.

Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments—places like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla’s FSD, by contrast, collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases, such as jaywalking pedestrians, aggressive lane merges, and unexpected construction detours.

As the saying goes, “If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.” If Waymo’s AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA, it’s far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast, Tesla’s suburban data might create a “same-shit-different-day” scenario, where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare, high-stakes scenarios.

# Regulatory relaxation is a double-edged sword

If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations, Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory, this could limit Tesla’s liability, especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However, accidents involving unsuspecting third parties (e.g., pedestrians) remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks, manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles, meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure, even for a small number of accidents.  Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework, courts ultimately determine liability, and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best, complicity at worst.

Tesla’s data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics—which is very impressive. However, publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because, again, L2 puts the onus on the driver.  But it's a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case, any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla, exposing them to unlimited liability.

# The scalability myth

Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo’s reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable, but this argument doesn’t hold weight for two reasons.  First, lidar is becoming much cheaper, and with volume production, costs could approach Tesla’s camera-only system.  Ironically, Elon’s first principles philosophy should be applied here: just because something was a certain way before doesn’t mean it has to be that way.  Secondly, the market for taxis in general is urban.  When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside?  Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed, giving it a more focused path to profitability.



# Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google

Waymo uses millions of AI-generated simulations to train its system. It’s AI teaching AI, similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations, but Waymo’s superior compute power (via Google’s custom TPUs) means it’s clearly dominant in this regard.

Tesla bulls often cite Elon’s dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla’s superior approach. But they overlook Google’s hegemony in AI.  They were in the game before anyone.  They delivered AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and many other paradigm-shifting, world-changing products, backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla’s Dojo may be promising, but it’s still a newbie.  
  


# tl;dr

Tesla’s $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving, which is to say its lead in AI.  If Tesla dominates AI, the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality, liability risks, and Waymo’s technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind.  In which case, it's vastly overvalued.

Any personal advice for continuing and not getting discouraged feeling like I am not gonna pick well again? 

Edit: didn’t expect this to really get attention and maybe only a couple replies not be on the front page? 

But thanks to everyone who gave me words of wisdom whether hard to hear or not. 

I’m just grateful for lessons and knowledge and perspective, stories etc; since I’m still a beginner and determined to learn this.

I’m not just saying Ooooo that looks good I got a good feeling about this one! 

No that’s actually just roulette and I’m not tryna live like that. 

Also a big reason I didn’t take the risks is because money is so damn tight and I was trying to have more capital for making decent investments as opposed to smaller or less likely contracts; or shares for things I thought would maybe give me some return on now but probably still had some time or that I didn’t have enough to make more than a 10s of dollars on. so I did the safer thing.

it’s self explanatory but waiting for a golden cross (or death cross) and buying a LEAPS.

I was basically wondering what are some issues with this strategy if anyone’s tried something similar, apart from the obvious like the lagging affect because it’s an AVERAGE indicator…that’s obvious and is a very glaring issue but has anyone tried this strategy and found ways to get around the lag? or is this strategy just not viable if not paired with other indicators/TA

the reason i thought about this was growth stocks like meta, apple, google and most recently costco had golden crosses and have gone up so high. costcos last golden cross was at like $887 or so and it’s now trading at \~$980 to $1000.

Obviously the longer you let a LEAPS run solely based off an AVERAGE indicator, the more risk your taking on cause it could very well cause a late exit and loss in profit. but what about doing maybe a month of price movement, and exiting?

would a golden cross LEAPS strategy not be viable? why or why not? i’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts!",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

Unity Software Inc. (doing business as **Unity Technologies**) is a technology company that specializes in developing and operating a platform for creating real-time 3D content and experiences. Unity is primarily known for its game engine and development tools, which allow creators to build, run, and monetize interactive 2D and 3D content across various platforms.

Their engine and development tools is used in wide range of industries including Video game development , architecture and design , automotive , film and animation , and virtual and augmented reality.

They are a duopoly in the game engine market with Epic Games (Unreal Engine). Unity holds approximately 40-50% of the game engine market share, while Unreal Engine accounts for 10-20%. As of 2023, over 70% of the top mobile games globally were developed using Unity's platform. In 2024, mobile gaming is expected to generate approximately $92.6 billion in revenue compared to $51.9 billion for console gaming and $40 billion for PC gaming. As of 2024, a significant portion of VR apps in the Apple Store are likely created using Unity, with estimates suggesting that over 60% of AR/VR content across platforms is made with Unity.

Unity's stock have been doing poorly ever since the great 2022 bear market , the John Riccitiello fee incident (2022) , and the dreadful IronSource purchase (2022) under his tenure. They have since fired him in 2023 and appointed Matthew Bromberg as Unity's new Chief Executive Officer, President, and a member of the Unity Board of Directors, effective May 15, 2024. Bromberg has since replaced all the C-suites with competent people. They did a reset on their portfolio to put their focus on their core business which they refer to as their ""Strategic Portfolio"": the Engine, Cloud and Monetization.

The Strategic Portfolio consists of two main segments:

* Create Solutions: This segment encompasses Unity's game development platform and tools. In Q3 2024, Create Solutions revenue grew 5% year-over-year, driven by subscription growth. The Create segment includes:

1. Unity game engine and development tools
2. Unity 6, the latest version of the engine with over 500,000 downloads
3. Expansion into non-gaming industries (Industry segment), which grew **59% year-over-year and represents 18% of Create revenue**

* Grow Solutions: This segment includes advertising and monetization tools. In Q3 2024, Grow Solutions revenue declined by 5%. It focuses on:

1. Advertising technology
2. Monetization services for game developers
3. Development of a new advertising model set to launch in 2025

Let's talk about the mobile gaming monetization and advertising space and their competitor AppLovin (the stock that is up 768% YTD) . AppLovin wanted to buy Unity for $20B back in 2022 to form a monopoly but got rejected. Unity has since failed to keep up with AppLovin who is now the third largest mobile gaming in-app advertising network after Google and Meta. Unity-ironSource platform just can't compete with AppLovin's superior algos and platform but things are about to change because the new CEO hired Jim Payne to join the company as Chief Product Officer for Advertising effective August 12, 2024. Payne co-founded MoPub, the world’s largest mobile in-app ad server and exchange, and MAX Advertising Systems, a mobile header bidding platform (both acquired by AppLovin). In their latest earning's call Bromberg said they have a new machine learning model in their new neural network that is being tested on their live data that will be ready to launch when it's ready (probably sometime next year). APP's current mcap is $111B while Unity is at $10.78B , if their new ML model is competitive , the stock can easily **5x from here just from the Grow Solutions business**. This is why some people are looking to short AppLovin and long Unity.

On the Create Solution side Unity recently announced on Oct 30, 2024 they hired Ex-King CTO and Havok Co-Founder Steve Collins as CTO which will add key technical leadership to accelerate product innovation, quality, and stability.  In 2023, Havok products were used in twelve of the top twenty best selling video games in the United States. Here are a [list of games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Video_games_using_Havok) you probably heard of that used Havok physics:

\- Dark Souls 1-3

\- Bloodborne

\- BioShock series

\- CS:GO

\- Half-Life 2

\- The Last of Us

\- Halo 2 & 3

\- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild & The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

Now let's talk about war , Unity's engine and development tools is also used by the DoD

The Department of Defense (DoD) primarily uses the Unity engine to create realistic, immersive virtual training simulations for military personnel, allowing them to practice complex scenarios in a safe and controlled environment across various domains like combat tactics, vehicle operation, war simulations and situational awareness, all within a 3D digital world.

Unity Technologies Corporation (UnityTec) has been awarded two significant contracts related to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD):

* [JETS 2.0 Contract](https://govtribe.com/opportunity/federal-contract-opportunity/dla-j6-enterprise-technology-services-jets-2-dot-0-sp470923r0001-45) : UnityTec secured a position on the Defense Logistics Agency's J6 Enterprise Technologies Services 2.0 (JETS 2.0) multiple-award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. This contract has a maximum value of $12 billion and will provide a broad range of IT-related services to the entire DoD for up to 12 years.
* CACI Contract: Unity signed a ""multi-million dollar"" contract with enterprise technology firm CACI to become the ""preferred real-time 3D platform"" for U.S. government defense projects.

I don't think even the Palantards know this , [Palantir's Mixed Reality](https://www.palantir.com/offerings/mixed-reality/) offering is built with Unity's 3D engine.

[The future of warfare is powered by Unity's 3D engine.](https://preview.redd.it/zw7w2aj2z26e1.png?width=2379&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4f900c7489db3c6841321cb494c66a8c0035add)

Now let's rewind it back to 2015 when [Mark Zuckerberg sent a four page internal email](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck-unity.pdf) to key executives to get in early on the AR and VR future. In that email , Mark Zuckerberg wanted to purchase Unity because he believes AR/VR is the major computing platform after mobile and they will gain control over a key development platform for AR/VR content. He believes the acquisition of Unity would also mitigate the risk of a competitors like Google and Apple from acquiring them and limiting Meta (Facebook then) access to the platform. One of the possible reasons the acquisition fell through is antitrust concerns because Meta would be a monopoly in VR/AR if they own Unity.

I believe the future is XR (extended reality) and that XR will be next major computing platform after mobile. I believe Meta will become the largest company in the world within the next 10-20 years, which is why I’m highly optimistic about Unity, given its significant role in the XR ecosystem. This is a long term investment for generational wealth.

This post is made for posterity.

- The turnaround story must be real, they must be fighting every second of every day to reduce costs and survive. What did this kind of management behaviour gave as a result for $CVNA ? Don’t start to touch yourself i’m not done yet. 

- The market sentiment is almost at an all time low, and rightfully so as they navigate a bunch of problems they caused themselves by being kind of moronic. The bet here is that they will improve on that aspect and stop shooting themselves in the foot every 2 minutes. 

- The cars are loved by their owners, this is self explanatory, a great product will always win and everything will be done to avoid seing it disappear. 

- The new cars will be a massive catalyst up to their launch if you have the patience to hold for at least 1 full year. The R2 will be a best seller and will absolutely destroy the market in which it will be competing. I would 100% buy one if I could. 

- The cars are US made and in this case the US manufactures are not just fighting Tesla they’re fighting China and a tech US company going bankrupt will not fly with the Trump administration. 

Bearish points will be quick, we all know why it’s a turd 

- Not being gross margin profitable is a crazy achievement for any kind of respected company,  that’s some new regarded level of regardness. 

- They could fail on everything they’re trying to accomplish 

- R2 might just be an other turd machine that doesn’t fit in any market  

- Elon Musk is literally running the country and has people everywhere, maybe he’ll just want to fuck with Rivian even if it’s a net negative for the US 


I have more to say but I just gave you bunch of regards way too much to read at once and I don’t want to fry the 2 remaining brain cells you still have up there.

2024-12-10,18:04:23,wallstreetbets,TSLA MSTR COIN RACE TO 1000,"We have to admit it, regards won! Portfolio managers spending their whole life aiming for +5%/year got smoked by regards that did 10x in 1-2 years.

So what's the plan now? What's stopping these 3 to reach $1000 / share? Lets analyze them:

1. TSLA. At $1000/share it's \~3.2T valuation. Around 2.5x from here.

2. MSTR. At $1000/share it's \~225B valuation. Around 2.75x from here.

3. COIN. At $1000/share it's \~250B valuation. Around 3.3x from here.

Market cap wise, COIN or MSTR probably has the best chance here but perhaps TSLA goes on a NVDA run to $1000/share.

So if we know this then what's the play for regards? Double leveraged of course!

TSLL @ 29. At 5x TSLL would be 150, probably more like 135 with decay.

MSTU @ 134. At 5.5x MSTU would be 737, probably more like 600 with decay.

CONL @ 55. At 6.6x CONL would be 360, probably more like 300 with decay.

2024-12-09,21:10:08,wallstreetbets,TikTok trade part 2: Oracle Puts ⭐️3 ,"I bought the TikTok meta play 3 weeks ago but sold my original calls and re-bought last week as Meta sank post election. I missed out on a possible 10X play by not timing buying and selling in line with the news cycle. Sorry I should have wrote a deep dive about this ages ago however I’m a relative rookie and I was unsure how it would play out so I bitched out. 

I ended up making $3K in profit from $500 investment but I sold early missing out on even more gains however the TikTok ban looks to be a multi part play so there is more to eat from the table.

This is a trend that will play out over the next 3 months with Supreme Court request, Jan 19 ban and Trump inauguration and I believe part 2 is here already.

ORCL has nearly doubled in the last 12 months but this is also in line with many AI/Tech stocks. However this means the street is expecting perfection and any negative news in guidance can see this fall. Company’s are obligated legally to let shareholders know of any risks and Tiktok will be sure to get a mention on the call. If investors even get a whiff that revenue is lower due to them losing TikTok data management their guidance is cooked. Even though TikTok is only 2-3% of their total business this can be seen as negative news as TikTok is still one of their biggest vendors and still growing in the US (soon to be was). 

The 3⭐️ is for my conviction rating anything above 3 is worth the bet and any idea that falls below gets thrown in the 🗑️. Little late to be posting but I hope it helps ",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2024-12-09,17:24:37,wallstreetbets,Quantum Computing Inc is going to crash,"Context: Quantum computing is having its moment. It’s risky, but could massively disrupt industries in areas like computing, finance and cyber security. But stock market bubbles are forming. 

Quantum computing is probably the most technically difficult industry for analysts to assess. Few people are equipped with an adequate understanding of quantum technologies, which is leading to massive mispricing. 

Quantum Computing Inc is junk

Iceberg Research’s recent short report covers some of them. They note that the firm has run from one fad to another (chips, ai, computing) and failed at each. They list several misleading claims that they’ve made and withdrawn. The report is damning and raises serious questions about the future of the company, I encourage you all to read it. 

However Iceberg does not go far enough.

https://iceberg-research.com/2024/11/27/quantum-computing-inc-the-phantom-chip-foundry/

They lack talent. Successful quantum innovations requires strong technical knowledge that you really can only come by in either leading universities or megacap firms like google. 

I went through the Linkedin profiles of each of their employees and compared them with their small cap competitors. I tallied up the share of employees that went to an Edu Rank top-100 world universities for Quantum Physics (which is a very broad net), they rank incredibly poorly among it’s peers - less than a fifth of employees (see picture)*. This is robust to different ranking metrics. Counting only Ivy leagues they come out much worse.

But look, not all employees are on linkedin. And this is the next big underdog? No. 

A large share of their “talent” comes from the Steven’s Institute of Technology, an unremarkable university in New Jersey (ranked 150+ for Quantum Physics depending on list) 

The company’s Chief Quantum Officer is Yuping Huang. On first glance he appears to have a prolific publishing history; however, most papers receive low citations and/or he is third, fourth or fifth author. Huang was previously sued by shareholders for breaching fiduciary duties when he merged his previous company with Quantum Computing Inc. Notably he is both a director and employee, which is a big corporate governance redflag (reminds me of Cassava Sciences). 

There is only one independent director with a background in Quantum Physics to provide checks and balance on Huang — Dr Javad Shabani. He is not up to the task. His publishing history is mediocre. 

Looking deeper, the Chief Technology Officer Yong Meng Sua, has an even more mediocre publishing history. And has only risen to an Assistant Professor role at Steven’s. He spends much of his time discussing esoteric computing questions tangential to his work (i.e. the NP=P problem, see their LinkedIn posts)

And finally the Director of the Company’s chip foundry (Iceberg has raised significant questions about the foundry). Dr Milan Begliarbekov after finishing high school enrolled in a bachelor’s degree in English literature at Steven’s, graduated, then immediately enrolled in a physics Phd at Steven’s. Either he is a savant polymath who is able to pick up grad school physics level math, or a Phd from Steven’s is worthless. His publishing career is very mediocre. 

These scientists will not crack the major problems stopping widespread commercialization of Quantum tech. Simply compare their publishing records to the founder at Ion-Q (Peter Chapman) or leading quantum scientists at Google, alongside the significant and verifiable technological advancements these companies have made. 

Another clue that something is amiss is headcount. Rigetti has three fold the number of employees. D-Wave six fold. All have similar market cap. What’s driving value? We’ve established that it’s not human capital. Iceberg’s research reveals it’s not intellectual property or physical capital either. 

So why has it done so well?  Regarded retail investors.

Only 3.3% of Quantum Computing Inc is held by institutional investors (and falling). Compared with ~40% for IONQ. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qubt/institutional-holdings

The lack of institutional investment while institutional investors are simultaneously clamouring to load up on quantum stocks is a massive red flag. In fact no Wall Street analysts track them. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/quantum-computing-qubt-stock-skyrockets-short-sellers-are-lurking

So what happens next? 

The 800% rise in one month is going to attract short selling interest as people realise it’s junk. The stock will fall back below $1. 

Risk:
If you want to short/buy puts, You can rest assured that the company is not going to suddenly become profitable. The main risk comes from why they’ve done so well, despite having little revenue, expertise, or innovation to show for it.

They’re literally called Quantum Computing Incorporated. If you’re a full regard wanting to invest in Quantum computing are you going to invest in IonQ (what?), Rigetti (spaghetti company?) or a company conveniently called Quantum Computing? It’s a regard trap. 

It’s like being interested in electric cars and passing on Tesla because you wanted to invest in a stock called Electric Car Co.

2024-12-09,03:49:17,wallstreetbets,$GOOG the BFTG,"
Regards, grab your tendies and gather around the fire because I’m going to tell you all about *$GOOG* (aka Alphabet) the BFTG (Big Fucking ~~Tech~~ Tendie Giant). I’ll break it down for you because I know you polish that 🧠 real nice so I can’t expect a single wrinkle. 

1. Criminally Low P/E Ratio

While all your other tech darlings are flexing P/E ratios like a hooker in heat, $GOOGL is at 23.4 P/E ratio.

For reference:
* $SPX: >27 P/E (yes, the S&P500)
* $MSFT: >36 P/E
* $AAPL: >39 P/E
* $NVDA: >56 P/E
* $AMZN: >47 P/E
* $TSLA: >106 P/E (Fuck you, for the window lickers in the back)

Remember a “good” P/E ratio is traditionally around 20-25. If you don’t understand then read a fucking book.

2. AI Incumming

Sure, everyone’s talking about OpenAI and ChatGPT, but who’s making real money here? Google owns 90%+ of search traffic (when did you ever hear “yahoo it” or “ask duck duck go”?) and monetizes it like a legal cartel. Once Gemini (+Legacy Bard) gets some improvements and a little lipstick even MORE money. Oh, and don’t forget Google Cloud, which grew revenues 30% YoY last quarter.

3. Santa Rally - Ho Ho Hold Onto Your Bollocks 🎅

Historically, December is green season for big-cap tech. Funds rebalance, and retail apes are YOLOing. The Santa Rally isn’t just a meme; it’s a statistical goldmine. With $GOOG’s recent earnings beat ($28.5B in 3 months), the market’s about to price this in as snow starts falling.

4. Big Tech = Safe Haven

Recession? Inflation? Global chaos? Who cares. Big Tech don’t give a *FUCK*. Ad spending may wobble, but companies will NEVER stop buying Google ads.

5. Buybacks on Steroids

$GOOGL has a $70 BILLION buyback program active, the best part? They’re buying low and will push us even higher.

TL;DR: Google Is The Perfect Combo of Value & Growth.

# Article summary:

* Nvidia's Dominance: Nvidia is a leading player in the AI chip market, experiencing significant revenue growth and stock performance. Over the past five years, Nvidia's stock has surged by 2,600%, and it's on track for a gain of more than 180% this year.
* Competition: Nvidia faces competition from other chip designers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, as well as from its own customers, such as Meta Platforms and Amazon, who are developing their own AI chips.
* Product Launches: Nvidia recently launched the H200 chip, which delivers twice the inference performance of its predecessor and quickly reached double-digit billion-dollar revenue. The company is also preparing to launch its Blackwell architecture and its most powerful chip ever.
* Market Concerns: Despite Nvidia's strong position, there are concerns that cost-conscious customers might shift to competitors offering lower-priced AI chips.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**

**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Offhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

# [S&P 500 futures rise after Meta Platforms, Tesla report earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures rose Thursday as Wall Street digested recent quarterly results from a slew of megacap tech companies. Investors are coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve held steady on rates.
*****
> Futures tied to the broad market index added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were fractionally lower.
*****
> Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla gained 1% and 2%, respectively, while Microsoft shares dipped more than 4% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company’s quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. On the other hand, revenue misses from UPS and Caterpillar weighed the indexes down.
*****
> Other “Magnificent Seven” names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple’s results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week.
*****
> On Wednesday, all three major averages ended the session lower as a 4% decline in Nvidia weighed on the market. The declines came after the Fed paused its interest rate-cutting campaign, leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their post-meeting statement, policymakers noted that inflation remains “somewhat elevated.”
*****
> “The implication is that we’re on hold until the inflation rate goes down, and unfortunately it’s probably not going to go down very much in the several months ahead, so I wouldn’t be looking for rate cuts at the next meeting,” Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “We have a relatively stable place where we’re standing, and it kind of supports the fact that the market is in a calm position right now, and so is [Jerome] Powell apparently,” he said.
*****
> On the economic data front, the fourth-quarter gross domestic product reading is due on Thursday, and weekly jobless claims are out in the morning. Investors are also looking ahead to Friday’s personal consumption expenditures price index report for December.

[Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) shares were flat after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom.

Here’s how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share**: $8.02 vs. $6.77
* **Revenue**: $48.39 billion vs. $47.04 billion

On a call with analysts, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained some of the rationale for the company’s recent efforts to [improve its relationship](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/11/meta-had-to-bend-the-knee-to-trump-ahead-of-inauguration.html) with President Donald Trump and the current White House administration.

“We now have a US administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning, and that will defend our values and interests abroad, and I am optimistic about the progress and innovation that this can unlock,” Zuckerberg said. “So this is going to be a big year.”

Meta said its first-quarter revenue would be in the range of $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion. The midpoint of that figure trailed analysts’ expectations of first-quarter revenue of $41.73 billion.

Meta’s fourth-quarter sales grew 21% year over year while its net income was $20.84.

The company said that daily active people came in at 3.35 billion in the quarter, up from 3.29 billion the previous quarter. Wall Street was projecting 3.32 billion for the fourth quarter.

Meta said that its first quarter costs and [expenses](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/24/zuckerberg-sets-metas-ai-targets-for-the-year-expects-to-spend-60-billion-on-growth.html) were $25.02 billion, representing a more than 5% increase from the prior year.

Meta reiterated last Friday’s announcement that it would invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 to fuel its AI strategy.

Meta did not provide a revenue outlook for 2025, but investments in the company’s core business “will give us an opportunity to continue delivering strong revenue growth throughout 2025,” finance chief Susan Li said in a statement.

The company expects its total expenses for 2025 to come in between $114 billion to $119 billion, with the bulk of the spending related to its infrastructure costs, Meta said. The company plans to hire workers for infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative artificial intelligence, regulation and compliance.

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors await Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were near the flatline on Wednesday as investors turned toward the first Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2025.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched down 13 points. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.3% higher, while S&P 500 futures was trading around the flatline.
*****
> Tech stocks on Tuesday led the S&P 500 higher and brought the Nasdaq Composite to a 2% gain. The two indexes made a comeback after incurring sharp losses on Monday in a sell-off spurred by the emergence of China’s DeepSeek and the threat it poses to the artificial intelligence trade. Nvidia, which suffered a roughly 17% decline Monday, jumped nearly 9% on Tuesday.
*****
> “As far as the DeepSeek news over the weekend, at the end of the day today, there really hasn’t been that much of an impact on a market-wide basis,” Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> The Fed’s interest rate decision on Wednesday is now a focal point for investors, as well as Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. Fed funds futures data reflect a nearly 100% certainty that the central bank will keep rates steady at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group data.
*****
> “When it comes to the Fed, they’re widely not expected to do anything tomorrow and that’s a good thing. The less the Fed has to do, the better it is for the market, in our view,” Hickey added.
*****
> Investors will be paying especially close attention to Powell’s comments — his first press conference in President Donald Trump’s second term. The two have had a contentious relationship dating back to Trump’s first term. The president has already said he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”
*****
> A volley of Big Tech earnings are due Wednesday afternoon, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla issuing their quarterly reports.

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors await Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were near the flatline on Wednesday as investors turned toward the first Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2025.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched down 13 points. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.3% higher, while S&P 500 futures was trading around the flatline.
*****
> Tech stocks on Tuesday led the S&P 500 higher and brought the Nasdaq Composite to a 2% gain. The two indexes made a comeback after incurring sharp losses on Monday in a sell-off spurred by the emergence of China’s DeepSeek and the threat it poses to the artificial intelligence trade. Nvidia, which suffered a roughly 17% decline Monday, jumped nearly 9% on Tuesday.
*****
> “As far as the DeepSeek news over the weekend, at the end of the day today, there really hasn’t been that much of an impact on a market-wide basis,” Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> The Fed’s interest rate decision on Wednesday is now a focal point for investors, as well as Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. Fed funds futures data reflect a nearly 100% certainty that the central bank will keep rates steady at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group data.
*****
> “When it comes to the Fed, they’re widely not expected to do anything tomorrow and that’s a good thing. The less the Fed has to do, the better it is for the market, in our view,” Hickey added.
*****
> Investors will be paying especially close attention to Powell’s comments — his first press conference in President Donald Trump’s second term. The two have had a contentious relationship dating back to Trump’s first term. The president has already said he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”
*****
> A volley of Big Tech earnings are due Wednesday afternoon, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla issuing their quarterly reports.

2025-01-29,04:21:57,stocks,Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones,"**Thoughts:** Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business (but may be bad/neutral for sat comm companies that do not work with AAPL such as GSAT), TMUS, and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. 

>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company’s in-house satellite-communication service.

>

>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone’s latest software update — released Monday — now supports the technology.

>

>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.

>

>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.

>

>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, “You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.” Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.

>

>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will “begin with select optimized smartphones” and that the full launch will “support the vast majority of modern smartphones.” T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

>

>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there’s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple’s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has “had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.”

>

>Here’s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.

>

>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.

>

>There’s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically — even when the phone is in a customer’s pocket.

>

>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don’t have cellular service. The capabilities can’t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.

>

>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple’s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn’t disclose the Starlink support.

>

>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile’s cellular network in November.

Looking at massive overinflation in stock price, the missed deliveries estimate last quarter, the discounts they had to make on those to make it even close to that number and I cannot see how they beat earnings.

I am pretty confident that a match or slight beat/ miss will cause the stock to correct. I am therefore thinking of taking my modest profit now and selling out of the stock completely. Notwithstanding my feelings on Musk's personal actions.

Recently disclosed text messages reveal that Elon Musk tried to sway Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund—commonly known as the Oil Fund—to support his controversial Tesla pay package. The fund, which manages assets of around USD 1.8 trillion and holds a significant stake in Tesla, voted against Musk’s compensation proposal, prompting him to admonish CEO Nicolai Tangen not to request any “favors” until making amends.

In their exchange, Musk also accused Tangen of leaking the texts to the media, after Norwegian outlets reported on his canceled dinner appearance at the Oil Fund’s investment conference. Tangen countered that Norway’s strict transparency laws, akin to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, required partial disclosure, including confirmation that Musk would not attend.

Initially, the Oil Fund classified much of the conversation as private and withheld it. However, in the spirit of transparency, they eventually released all texts. The incident highlights the tension between Musk’s calls for discretion and the Norwegian Oil Fund’s legal obligations to remain open. While emphasizing a positive relationship with Tesla as a critical investment, the fund has reiterated its opposition to Musk’s pay plan.",TSLA,Tesla

# [S&P 500 futures are flat as Nvidia attempts to rebound from AI stock rout: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures were relatively unchanged early Tuesday, following a sell-off fueled by worries over the emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek and its greater implications for the artificial intelligence trade.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500, along with Nasdaq 100 futures, traded just above the flatline, rising 0.1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were also flat.
*****
> Futures were trading in step with Nvidia in the premarket, with both trading off their highs during the session. Nvidia added around 2% after suffering a nearly 17% decline on Monday, which resulted in a market cap loss of nearly $600 billion — the biggest one-day drop for a U.S. company in history. Broadcom and Oracle also traded higher by more than 2% and around 1%, respectively.
*****
> Concerns over DeepSeek came to a head on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite losing more than 3%, while the S&P 500 slid about 1.5%. The Chinese startup last month unveiled a free open-source large language model that it says took less than $6 million to build. The development spurred worries around Big Tech’s investment into AI. DeepSeek surpassed rival OpenAI on Monday to become the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store.
*****

# [S&P 500 futures are flat as Nvidia attempts to rebound from AI stock rout: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures were relatively unchanged early Tuesday, following a sell-off fueled by worries over the emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek and its greater implications for the artificial intelligence trade.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500, along with Nasdaq 100 futures, traded just above the flatline, rising 0.1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were also flat.
*****
> Futures were trading in step with Nvidia in the premarket, with both trading off their highs during the session. Nvidia added around 2% after suffering a nearly 17% decline on Monday, which resulted in a market cap loss of nearly $600 billion — the biggest one-day drop for a U.S. company in history. Broadcom and Oracle also traded higher by more than 2% and around 1%, respectively.
*****
> Concerns over DeepSeek came to a head on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite losing more than 3%, while the S&P 500 slid about 1.5%. The Chinese startup last month unveiled a free open-source large language model that it says took less than $6 million to build. The development spurred worries around Big Tech’s investment into AI. DeepSeek surpassed rival OpenAI on Monday to become the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store.
*****
> “Valuations remain extended, and while vulnerabilities were expected this year, developments like DeepSeek highlight the need for diversification beyond the Mag Seven,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. “The 2025 theme of US exceptionalism is now facing uncertainty, with ongoing concerns around tariffs and inflation adding to market challenges.”

2025-01-28,06:21:43,stocks,META & MSFT Earnings in Deep Doo Doo?,"Coming off the market reaction yesterday to DeepSeek and the questions investors have about the future of AI stock valuations, how do people see earnings playing out for big AI spenders MSFT and META?

Both companies announced big CAPEX spend related to AI for the coming year 2025. Regardless if the amount spent on DeepSeek is true or not, the narrative seems to be that AI may not need as much money as originally thought. 

Both companies' stock were hit in the short term in the past on their plans for big AI spending. These are both good companies but since their earnings are juxtaposed to this risk-off market reaction to DeepSeek, can earnings be positive for MSFT and META?

2025-01-27,22:16:38,stocks,"Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history","Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.

The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

The selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. 

Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”

The analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”

But after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.

Data center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.

For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.

Nvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.

CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.

The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.

Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.

“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.

Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

2025-01-27,13:06:13,stocks,The Case for TSLA: the Business Value,"Many people consider TSLA to be overvalued based on fundamentals. Make no mistake - it absolutely is... based on fundamentals.

The value of TSLA, beyond the Twitter-political volatility, comes from its proven track record in achieving the impossible.

**Breaking Into an Otherwise Unbreakable Car Market**

How many new Western car companies can you recall successfully breaking into the market in the last few decades?

The only real answer is TSLA.

Everything else is bleeding money, a penny stock, or a YouTube car review channel side quest.

**Popularizing an Otherwise Undesirable and Impossible Product**

Before the EV boom, any consideration of a successful EV business would be immediately countered with legitimate concerns.

The car community wouldn't be very excited without their loud 4L V8 engines.

The product would be impossible to make as the batteries would be expensive, heavy, unreliable, and yield a low driving range. If you did get an EV, you wouldn't be able to charge it since there were no charger networks.

Not to mention the expected environmental returns from selling EVs, but generally disrupting the market and directing it towards sustainable energy cars. I love my fuel-hungry loud 6-cylinder German beast, but ICE engines in the mainstream have an expiration date and will eventually become a niche when the larger market transitions to EVs. TSLA takes the credit for this - singlehandedly. Everybody else follows.

**Scaling Up: Actually Selling Cars**

Tesla is [still leading](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/electric-vehicle-sales-us-2024-increase-cox-automotive/737528/) EV sales, and is in the [top 10](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/06/top-10-best-selling-cars-in-the-us-in-2023.html) of all car sales. Meanwhile, VW is closing down their factories in Germany.

**Advertisement by Word of Mouth**

You see Ford Focus 1.0 EcoBoost billboard ads everywhere in Europe, and RAM / JEEP / Chevy Silverado / F-150 / Hyundai / Kia ads everywhere in the US.

TSLA built itself on word of mouth and a vision for the future, which is a testament to its value for customers.

**Elon's Proven Track Record in Business**

[Winning](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/science/spacex-moon-nasa.html) NASA award contracts in competition with Blue Origin and other space companies, [catching](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp66ye6ep63o) skyscraper sized objects landing, and a Roadster [roaming](https://www.astronomy.com/science/astronomers-just-deleted-an-asteroid-because-it-turned-out-to-be-elon-musks-tesla-roadster/) through space are just a few of the business and technological achievements of Elon Musk (not to mention the side quests). With someone so unreasonably effective at building things that work, investors project that TSLA is a safe and promising bet.

How many reusable rockets has anybody else caught landing recently?

**Criticisms**

No product or company is without criticisms. From the bad build quality, to the still-unfulfilled FSD promises, to the lack of Cybertrucks in Europe, to the removal of the turn signal stalks; and most recently, the political criticisms.

**Consequential Actions, Not Ideologies, Drive the World**

The bottom line for a business is creating products and services that people love, and there are *zero* indicators that TSLA, as a business, is going anywhere. It thrives *despite* all criticism (of which I do think most is reasonable) and lack of marketing, which is a testament to the value they provide.

**Market Temper Tantrums Are a Feature, Not a Bug**

Look beyond the ephemeral temper tantrum-driven volatility of the market.

Last year, in March, GOOG dipped from 160 to 135 when Gemini generated some questionable images; today it's close to ATH at >200.

Last year, in August, CRWD dipped from 380 to 220 when they pushed out a buggy update. (How dare they, a software company, pushing a buggy update?!) Today, it's trading close to ATH again.

Today, the market finally noticed DeepSeek and is going through yet another mental breakdown.

It is like a palm tree: it will bend but it won't break.

Learn to put your prejudices aside and buy companies that execute well - not companies with a nice little PR team that will sweet talk you.

**But Is It Overpriced?**

By traditional fundamentals analysis - of course it is. But we've already established there's nothing traditional about TSLA as a company, so your little P/E ratio calculations won't work. They have failed consistently.

Look at the execution of TSLA and compare it to its Western competitors - they aren't even in the same league.",TSLA,Tesla

DeepSeek, an AI startup just over a year old, stirred awe and consternation in Silicon Valley with its breakthrough artificial intelligence model that offered comparable performance to the world’s best chatbots at seemingly a fraction of the cost. Created in China’s Hangzhou, DeepSeek carries far-reaching implications for the global tech industry and supply chain, offering a counterpoint to the widespread belief that the future of AI will require ever-increasing amounts of power and energy to develop.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

DeepSeek Shakes Up Stocks as Traders Fear for US Tech Leadership",">Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek rocked global technology stocks Monday, raising questions over America’s technological dominance.

>Buzz grew over the weekend about DeepSeek’s latest AI model being cost-effective while running on reduced-capability chips, casting doubt on the validity of the sky-high valuations for companies like Nvidia Corp. The Chinese firm’s product, released last week, is now at the top of Apple Inc.’s App Store rankings.

>“DeepSeek shows that it is possible to develop powerful AI models that cost less,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. “It can potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain, which is driven by high spending from a small handful of hyperscalers.”

>Founded by quant fund founder Liang Wenfeng, the app’s underlying AI model is widely seen as competitive with OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc.’s latest. Lauded by investor Marc Andreessen as “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs,” DeepSeek’s assistant shows its work and reasoning as it addresses a user’s written query or prompt. Reviews on Apple’s app store and on Alphabet Inc.’s Android Play Store praised that transparency.

>Nasdaq 100 futures tumbled as much as 1.9%, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell as much as 1%. The moves represent continued losses from Friday’s cash session, as US shares cooled after gains earlier in the week as President Donald Trump took office.

>In contrast, stocks advanced in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng Tech Index climbing as much as 2% ahead of Lunar New Year holidays this week. Chinese AI-related stocks including Merit Interactive Co. surged by their daily limits. Merit is among those with the clearest links to DeepSeek after stating in an earlier filing that it had incorporated the homegrown AI firm’s model into marketing.

>Meanwhile, shares in the AI supply chain slumped as investors rethink their assumptions that the most advanced AI will require increasing amounts of computing power and energy. Major Nvidia supplier Advantest Corp., slid as much as 8.6% in Tokyo. Data centers shares also slipped, with Singapore-listed Mapletree Industrial Trust down 3.6%. Markets were closed for holidays in Taiwan and South Korea.

>The DeepSeek product “is deeply problematic for the thesis that the significant capital expenditure and operating expenses that Silicon Valley has incurred is the most appropriate way to approach the AI trend,’ said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer and internet at Singapore-based Aletheia Capital. “It calls into question the massive resources that have been dedicated to AI.”

>Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.com, says the updated AI model unveiled by China’s DeepSeek raises concerns about geopolitical risks as well as questions about US tech stock valuations.

>The decline in Nasdaq futures comes at the start of a big week for earnings from major tech companies including Apple and Microsoft Corp. Profit growth is expected to have slowed while valuations remain inflated, once again causing concern over the large AI-driven rally in the sector.

>The Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 estimated forward earnings, compared with its three-year average of 24 times. Nvidia is at 33 times, though that’s slightly down from its three-year average. Shares of Nvidia were more than 3% lower on the alternative trading system Blue Ocean in Asia morning, according to Kok Hoong Wong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities

>The DeepSeek release raises new doubts, challenging the notion that China’s AI technology is years behind US counterparts. Washington’s trade restrictions had kept the most cutting-edge chips out of China’s hands, but DeepSeek’s model was built using open source technology that is easy to access.

>“While current leaders like Nvidia have a strong foothold, it is a reminder that AI dominance cannot be taken for granted,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. “The emergence of China’s DeepSeek indicates that competition is intensifying, and although it may not pose a significant threat now, future competitors will evolve faster and challenge the established companies more quickly. Earnings this week will be a huge test.”

2025-01-26,20:47:36,stocks,S&P500 vs individual stocks,"Hi all,
Apologies for the maybe stupid question.

I have started investing about 1 year ago almost all of it (if not all) into well diversified ETFs like SXR8 and SPYY (yes, I know they overlap but I wanted to make it a little bit more USA heavy).

Now, I have really been wanting to invest into stocks and, of course, do the due diligence of learning about it. As I am still on the basics I can't help myself but ask, even long term, is SPY a better bet than, let's say, AAPL?
I understand that sometimes picking the ""good"" stock is difficult, but even 10 years ago Apple was among the companies with the highest market cap and still managed to outperform the index.

So I have 2 stupid questions based on this:
1. In your opinion, might this continue to happen in the future? Not necessarily apple but alphabet, Microsoft, nvidia or Meta are safer bets than Spy?
2. What are your recommendations on where to learn about investing into individual stocks, not say trading but more middle term (I believe it's called swing trading?)

Thanks in advance!",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2025-01-26,19:27:18,stocks,"Apple Remains a Threat in AR, Even as Meta and Google Race Ahead",">Meta and Google have jumped out ahead in the race to make augmented reality glasses for consumers, but Apple remains a looming threat. Also: The iPhone maker brings in a fixer for its Siri and AI efforts, and the company has a decision to make about its longtime chairman. Samsung, meanwhile, just unveiled impressive new AI features and is poised to beat Apple to market with a skinny smartphone.

>A decade ago, it began developing AR technology for its now-defunct attempt to build a self-driving vehicle. The idea: a windshield that could overlay navigation information, traffic alerts, camera feeds and other data while the car drove around town on its own. Apple even built a simulator of the concept at its Silicon Valley offices and managed to turn the idea into a working prototype that showed promise to executives.

>But the company quickly realized that this Minority Report-like experience would be too power-hungry and expensive to put inside of a vehicle. So it turned its attention to headsets, which can provide the same data in a smaller package. A person in the car could simply wear some headgear instead of needing to have the technology built into the windshield.

>The car glasses idea didn’t get too far either. But Apple’s vehicle group poured resources into developing AR displays and used virtual reality goggles to demonstrate the car’s capabilities. That ultimately led to Apple’s work on a consumer headset.

>At the time, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook felt that VR goggles were too isolating. He preferred AR, which keeps users in the real world while superimposing data on their field of vision. But it was also clear that the true AR dream — a lightweight pair of glasses that customers could wear all day — was still far off.

>That’s about the time when Mike Rockwell stepped in. That executive, who currently oversees Apple’s Vision Pro division, moved the AR and VR efforts into a team that was separate from the car unit. Rockwell and his staff spent the better part of two years creating a headset prototype that melded VR and AR into an approach that Apple eventually called spatial computing.

>This was the great compromise: Users weren’t truly seeing the real world around them, but the device’s pass-through cameras made it feel like they were. The project was greenlit, and the company eventually spent billions of dollars to develop the device — all while continuing to work on making true AR glasses a reality. That led to the release of the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset a year ago.

>Apple had originally hoped to release AR spectacles as a follow-up to the Vision Pro, but the technical challenges were just too great. Such a product remains far away, and the company is still tinkering with the underlying technologies.

>At the same time, rivals like Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have jumped ahead in the AR race. Meta showed off a prototype of augmented reality glasses last year, and Google is working with Samsung Electronics Co. on their own next-generation devices. Meta also has had success with its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which don’t have a display but can handle tasks like recording video and making phone calls.

>The Vision Pro, meanwhile, has largely been a flop, hurt by its cumbersome design and $3,500 price tag. That said, it’s hard to discount Apple’s innovation abilities. Work on the AR screens remains ongoing at a secretive facility in Santa Clara, California, one town over from the company’s home base in Cupertino.

>Though there were layoffs at the site last year — when Apple scrapped plans for in-house smartwatch displays — the company kept some employees around to work on AR technology, along with a manufacturing facility to develop and test future screens.

>Tepid demand for the Vision Pro has only made Apple more certain that AR glasses are a superior format. But the executives involved in the effort don’t think a product will be ready for three years or more. In the meantime, Apple expects to release other devices in the style of Vision Pro that it hopes will be cheaper and more enticing to consumers.

>While it develops the AR technology for future devices, the company is conducting user studies at its offices to gauge the appeal of features and interfaces. Apple is already working on a version of visionOS — the Vision Pro’s software — that will run on glasses. It’s also exploring other types of wearable products, including a rival to Meta’s Ray-Ban spectacles and even camera-equipped AirPods.

>The question now is whether Apple’s rivals are getting too far ahead. Meta’s AR prototype, called Orion, will set the stage for a consumer product by 2027. And Google’s new Android XR operating system is meant to usher in a wave of headsets and glasses, with Samsung first in line to release devices.

>When I first tested Android XR in December at Google’s headquarters, the company showed me several glasses prototypes — with and without displays. They seemed polished for prototypes, but they won’t hit the market until the display technology improves and costs come down. Another issue to be solved: battery life.

>Meta, Google and Samsung also aren’t slowing down on development of VR and mixed-reality devices. Meta is working on Quest 4 VR goggles, as well as a new high-end model that could eventually become a successor to the Quest Pro mixed-reality headset, I’m told. Samsung, meanwhile, showed off the hardware for its “Moohan” mixed-reality headset during its Unpacked event this past week.

>In interviews, Samsung and Google executives hinted that this headset would be cheaper than the Vision Pro and that it’s on track to debut this year. The companies won’t have to share the spotlight with Apple, which is unlikely to ship any major new head-worn device in 2025.

>But the real showdown will come in the years ahead, when AR glasses are refined enough to serve as a smartphone replacement. You can imagine a future where people use smart spectacles as their primary mobile device and then turn to a mixed-reality or VR headset for gaming or computing tasks. In that vision, head-worn devices will have supplanted both phones and laptops — markets worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

>Given what’s at stake, Apple can’t afford to stay on the sidelines too long. But the company does have a history of swooping into already-established markets and beating competitors with better design and more elegantly integrated hardware and software. The playbook it used so effectively in smartphones and watches could work again.

>

>Under the deal being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner, ByteDance, would retain a minority stake in the company, but the app's algorithm, data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's Web infrastructure, NPR reported.

>

>The NPR report cited two people with knowledge of the talks. The White House and Oracle had no immediate comment.

>

>The short video app used by 170 million Americans was taken offline temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by its Chinese owner ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on Jan. 19.

>

>Trump, after taking office a day later, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in place after U.S. officials warned that under ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused.

>

>The possible deal reported by NPR would mean that American investors would own a majority stake in TikTok. However, the report added that the terms of the deal could change and are still being hammered out.

>

>""The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok,"" a person directly involved in the talks but not authorized to speak publicly was quoted as saying by NPR.

>

>""ByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership.""

>

>Other potential investors who are engaged in the talks include Microsoft, NPR reported.

>

>Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, NPR reported.

>

>Oracle was interested in a TikTok stake ""in the tens of billions,"" but the rest of the deal is in flux, the NPR report cited the source as saying.

>

>Trump has said he ""would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture"" in TikTok.

>

>NPR cited another source as saying that appeasing Congress is seen as a key hurdle by the White House.

>

>Free speech advocates have opposed TikTok's ban under a law passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden.

>

>The company says U.S. officials misstated its ties to China, arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the U.S.

**Thoughts:** There are a TON of entities/people who have been rumored to buy Tik Tok (off the top of my head I can list Elon Musk, META, Kevin O' Leary, Mr. Beast and an assortment of random PE firms, Perplexity AI, and now Larry Ellison/ORCL)- I assume that these entities and affiliated companies may be worth looking at and possibly taking a short position in if they've reacted strongly to Tiktok acquisition rumors in the past.

2025-01-25,17:07:50,stocks,Deere - has run out of room to run.,"The great American company is trading at a all time high but is facing a lot of headwinds in 2025.

1 Tarriffs - Deere made the mistake of outsourcing their production outside the US and will pay the price with the new administration. They recently announced they were moving production to Mexico for some of the equipment manufacturing which lead to a boycott by farmers and a threat of 200% tariff if they do, which wont happen because you cant really impose this (tariff)tax on a specific company. But this was a mistake by the company because now they spent all this money to setup the factories and production in Mexico but cant really use it as intended.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-john-deere-will-be-hit-with-200-tariffs-if-production-moves-mexico-2024-09-23/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-john-deere-will-be-hit-with-200-tariffs-if-production-moves-mexico-2024-09-23/)

They also made the mistake of outsourcing tractor production to India. A good amount of production is outside the US, meaning tractors are assembled in India, Europe and elsewhere and sent to the US for sale. Which is a problem because these are not cheap tractors/equipment and someone is going to pay the tariff on foreign goods entering the United States. Not that easy to readjust the whole supply chain back to the US and having to pay people alot more money. Average worker in India makes $5k per year ,in the US these manufacturing jobs will cost maybe $50k-$80k+ per year. Profit margins just got smaller.

Then there is the US manufacturing exports. Deere Exports alot of their products to other countries, not all customers are in the US. If we impose tariffs on lets say German cars coming into the US, they will 100% in retaliation impose tariffs on US cars, heavy equipment and farm equipment being sent into Europe, South America, China, Etc.  Deere isnt the only manufacturer of tractors and farm equipment, you have a lot of manufacturers around the world. People are just going to buy cheaper domestic products.

2 Rumored Pick up truck - There's been a rumor going around they are planning to launch a pick up truck. I think this would be a costly mistake and they just wouldn't be able to compete with the best selling pickup in the world the F-150. Car manufacturing is very expensive as Elon has stressed multiple times, ramping up production costs ALOT of money, and might not be worth the effort, especially if it flops. There is just too much competition is the space between Toyota, Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Rivian, Nissan, Dodge.

3 FTC sues Deere for Farmers right to repair - The complaint -This unfair steering practice has boosted Deere’s multi-billion-dollar profits on agricultural equipment and parts, growing its repair parts business while burdening farmers with higher repair costs, the FTC’s complaint alleges.

i dont think this FTC suit is going away, the current administration will 100% stand behind the hard working farmers that feed America. 62% of revenue comes from Agriculture Equipment and 13% comes from financial services. Farmers are using Deere Financing to repair Deere equipment, Its 100% a monopoly.

Between decreasing revenue/sales, higher labor cost, higher production costs and increased competition this company has quite a few challenges to work through this year.

Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear there.

I felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.

We are now on year 4, and to date I have sarcastically remarked about how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time performed against SPY and VTI.  This year I was rather surprised at the results.  All 2025 numbers use the prices right now.

2025-01-22,20:11:24,stocks,Nvidia Zero-Day Options Are the Next Big Bet for ETF Upstart,">The ETF industry’s upstart-in-chief is back with another roll of the new-product dice — this time betting on a game-changing expansion of Wall Street’s zero-day options boom.

>Matt Tuttle, who struck gold with leveraged meme-stock funds but fell flat with his Jim Cramer ETFs, has filed to create a line of new offerings that will trade fast-twitch derivatives on popular companies beloved by the retail-investing masses. Think Nvidia Corp., Tesla Inc., MicroStrategy Inc. and more.

>The gamble? Publicly traded single-stock options aren’t available on a daily basis, meaning 0DTE bets can currently only occur on a Friday when weekly, monthly and quarterly contracts expire. Yet Tuttle says he is convinced it’s a matter of time before derivatives tied to individual companies shift to daily expiry.

>“Whether that’s three months from now, six months from now, two years from now, I have no idea,” the Tuttle Capital Management CEO said. “My thinking is if I do believe that’s going to happen, I want to be first in line for it.”

>In the meantime, Tuttle has come up with a workaround for his new ETFs, which could launch in the first half of the year provided the Securities and Exchange Commission doesn’t object. They’ll trade so-called Flex options — customized contracts that allow users to set terms such as strike prices and expiration dates — and roll them on a daily basis. Such contracts can be listed on exchanges without approvals in advance, Tuttle said.

>America’s dynamic $11 trillion ETF industry is no stranger to investment strategies being prepared before demand, feasibility or even regulatory approval is assured. Increasingly complicated strategies featuring diverse leverage and return targets are being packaged into the easily traded wrapper and sold to the masses.

>Tuttle is seeking to capitalize on two hot but controversial trends on Wall Street: Selling options to generate income, and trading those with zero days to expiration, or 0DTE. His firm plans a series of so-called 0DTE covered-call ETFs targeting mostly technology megacaps including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp.

>To Ben Johnson, head of client solutions at Morningstar, the industry’s emphasis on first-mover advantage and apparent indifference to the risks of many strategies highlight the growing competition between firms for new business.

>“Another blast from the ETF industry’s spaghetti cannon, a shot fired in hopes that a few of these products might stick to the wall,” Johnson said. Sponsors are “clearly not all that interested in whether these products actually have any long-term investment merit,” he said.

>The concept of an ETF using 0DTE options is not new. The likes of Defiance ETFs and Roundhill Investments have launched ETFs focused on indexes such as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 that aim to harvest income from zero-day contracts. But almost three years after derivatives on indexes and ETFs began expiring daily, the same change has yet to be made for single-stock options.

>Unlike S&P 500 index options that are proprietary to Cboe Global Markets — the trading venue at the center of the 0DTE craze — listing single-stock zero-day contracts would be an industry-wide effort, said a spokesperson at the exchange.

>Tuttle attracted widespread attention in 2021 when he launched a fund betting against Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF. While his attempt to ride the fame of Cramer, the host of CNBC’s Mad Money show, sputtered in short order, his foray into super-leveraged single-stock ETFs produced some of 2024’s biggest hits.

>“The ETF industry is very clever about finding workarounds, to buy time until the real thing is ready,” Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, said of the proposed funds. “In the end, how the sausage is made isn’t that important to investors. They just care that they’re getting this sort of cool hot sauce and end product.”

**Thoughts on this:** ETFs that become massive from investors not understanding the risks are nothing new (XIV, we shall never forget thee) but this will lead to interesting trading situations when there's dislocation between these theorized 0-DTE underlying ETFs and security itself. I can foresee a situation where 0-DTEs are massively overvalued/undervalued compared to what the underlying should theoretically be and then take a arbitrage position on these (assuming that the ETF is liquid). Guess they really want that options gambling money from the people who can't get approved to trade options.

2025-01-21,14:26:39,stocks,XPEL: Analyzing Growth Potential in the Automotive Market,"Here’s my condensed analysis of XPEL: FYI: I focus on uncovering companies with strong growth potential and sharing my insights.

**Note:** All hyperlinks will lead you to direct source material 

**Disclaimer:** I **DO NOT** own shares of XPEL at the time of writing

I would love to hear from the community and have a in-depth conversation from ya'll. Thank you & enjoy!

# Macro Overview:

**Electric Vehicle Growth**

The U.S. EV market is projected to show annual growth of 10.54% from 2025-2029, resulting in a market value of $156.3 billion by 2029 [according to Statista.](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/united-states) Unit sales alone are projected to reach 2.32 million units by 2029 as well. Consumers now have significantly more choices when shopping for an electric vehicle. They can choose from offerings by [Tesla](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/), [Ford](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/), [GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM/), [Honda](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HMC/), Hyundai, and many others.

EV's often have unique aesthetic and maintenance needs that typically have high-quality protective films and coatings. The growth in consumer adoption of EV's coincides with Xpel products, particularly on the impact in the aftermarket. EV owners value vehicle preservation. This creates a growing market share for XPEL'S products. These products also include heat-reducing window films that indirectly enhance battery performance.

**Aging Vehicles**

The average car or truck on the road in the U.S in 2024, was more than 12.6 years old, a new record according to [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/fuel-for-thought-average-age-vehicles-2024.html#:~:text=Vehicles%20on%20the%20road%20are,by%20two%20months%20over%202023.). Consumers now choose to keep cars longer than they used to. This is largely because of the increases in new vehicle prices. As these older vehicles age, the demand for general maintenance and preservation are more-likely to rise.

Car price increases have climbed for four consecutive months, according to [Kelley Blue Book data](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/after-4-straight-months-price-increases-new-car-now-costs-nearly-50000). As of December 2024, the average price of a new vehicle was $49,740, the second-highest level ever recorded. Economic uncertainty and higher costs can discourage new purchases. This situation favors repairs and maintenance of existing vehicles as the fleet continues to get older before replacement.

**Technological advancements**

[Self-healing films](https://www.xpel.com/products/paint-protection-film/ultimate-plus?srsltid=AfmBOopjFd4lU0Io05gEI-r8EsK9Z7gIDE7DRjI1mI7yEhQAFqPDeofN) from XPEL and competitors [3M](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MMM/), [Eastman Performance Films](https://www.eastman.com/en/who-we-are/locations/fieldale-va-usa), and [STEK Automotive](https://www.stekautomotive.com/) were released much earlier. They have recently gained traction as consumers want paint protection film to protect their vehicles. Self-healing films use polymer capable of automatically repairing minor scratches and abrasions when exposed to heat. As vehicles on the road become increasingly older, the demand for reduced effort in maintaining a vehicle's exterior will increase. Vehicle owners will likely seek easier maintenance solutions with minimal effort that repel against water, dirt, and scratches more easily. Consumers and manufacturers are increasingly adopting self-healing films. People who want to protect their older vehicles find XPEL appealing. It is also chosen to keep luxury cars in pristine condition.

# Investment Thesis:

XPEL is a compelling investment with an attractive growth story in the automotive sector. It is supported by a strong brand presence, international expansion growth, and financial strength. With high expectations, investors should take notice in the premium valuation risks apparent. Long-term growth is certainly compelling but there are clear short-term headwinds including macroeconomic uncertainties that require careful monitoring.

* **Product Diversification:** XPEL is widely known for their paint protection films. These films contribute to 70% of total Q3 sales and grew by 2.7%. Still, products like their window film and ceramic coatings have outperformed with growth of 20.6%. [Non-automotive products](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_presentations/2024/11/Q3-2024-XPEL-Investor-Presentation.pdf) like home & office window films, antimicrobial film, and niche surface protection film also out-performed by 11.6%. Together, both segments contributed 30% to total sales. Impressive growth outperformance though has largely been a significant reason for overall revenue growth in recent quarters.
* **International Expansion:** U.S. sales are the largest contributor to total revenue, accounting for 57.2% of the total and reaching $64.6 million in Q3, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9.4%. Despite the reliance on U.S. sales, International sales continue to outperform. Canada is the second largest contributor at 12.8% of revenue with growth of 25.7% to $14.4 million. All international markets saw growth except for the third largest market which is China. China saw a significant decline of -11.6% to just $9.06 million. The decrease was primarily attributed to XPEL's distributor working through excess inventory levels. With only a weighting of 8% of total sales, the negative growth did not hurt overall sales significantly. While XPEL faced challenges in China as well as minor growth of 4.1% and 1.4% in Europe and the U.K, strong international performance lead to record revenue.
* **Strategic Partnerships:** XPEL has established multiple strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. Recent collaborations with brands like [Tesla](https://lp.xpel.com/tesla-window-film), [Kia](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), exclusive [Rivian](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_news/XPEL-and-Rivian-Expand-Collaboration-With-New-PPF-and-Window-Film-Program-2024.pdf) supplier partnership, [BMW](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), and [Team Penske](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2024/07/10/xpel-partners-with-team-penske-to-protect-indycars-and-drivers/) have been formed. These collaborations, including with service providers like [Tint World](https://www.tintworld.com/news-media/news-and-press/industry-leaders-tint-world-and-xpel-announce-partnership/), have strengthened market presence. Brand visibility and revenue growth have also increased as a result. The Tesla partnership in particular is of major importance due to their dominance in the EV market. These recent collaborations integrate XPEL's wide array of products into solutions for high-profile vehicles and events. The partnerships with Tesla and Rivian are particularly significant. They expand their reach into the electric vehicle market that continues to rapidly grow in the U.S. and internationally.

# Risk Factors:

* **Reliance On Chinese Distribution:** [Potential tariff threats to China](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-importers-rush-goods-china-trump-tariff-threat-looms-2025-01-15/) from a new administration will significantly impact XPEL if enacted. If new tariffs are applied, XPEL will be faced with increases in far materials leading to higher production costs. With the U.S market as the largest source of revenue at 57.2%, passing on further costs to consumers would likely reduce demand. Most importantly, reliance on one distributor could lead to supply chain constraints due to an over-reliance on one company. Price increases or delayed deliveries would harm relationships and hurt XPEL's brand.
* **The Culper Research Short Report:** On October 19, 2023, [Culper Research issued a short report](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/cc91fda7-4669-4d1b-81ce-a0b8d77f25ab/downloads/Culper_XPEL_10-19-2023.pdf?ver=1733419998410) sending XPEL's stock retreating -17.3% from $51.51 per share to $42.61. A notable accusation was XPEL's understated reliance on Tesla. [XPEL responded](https://ppfmag.com/short-seller-targets-xpel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) by stating Tesla represented just 5% of 2023 revenue. Secondly, Culper believes XPEL is concealing a massive risk. Their primary supplier, ""Entrotech, Inc"", has formed a [joint venture with PPG Industries](https://news.ppg.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/PPG-launches-paint-films-solutions-for-automotive-and-industrial-customers/default.aspx) on May 23, 2023. Lastly, Culper's claim as seen below, would have massive repercussions for XPEL if they are correct.
* **Additional Culper Info:** The validity of Culper's claims on XPEL and others have been [called into question many times](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/827876/000166357721000030/ex99_1.htm) for self-benefiting public statements. What we do know for sure is the joint venture with PPG Industries is in fact truthful. The extent of which XPEL will become obsolete on the other is a highly questionable take. For some reason, Culper did not mention that XPEL stands out due to their DAP software. It is not because of the PPF raw material. Hence, XPEL would know exactly how much material and company their products were installed on. These allegations were made in 2023. XPEL has continued to show strong growth. The company has not skipped a beat.

# Conclusion

XPEL offers an attractive growth story in the automotive industry. This growth is supported by their strong market position and international expansion. The company also has a diverse product portfolio and strategic partnerships. A P/E ratio of 23.98 certainly wouldn't be viewed as cheap by any measures. Still, their P/E is significantly below their five-year average P/E of 41.6. Long-term growth remains compelling with the expectation of double-digit growth in the next two years.

Nonetheless, there are near-term headwinds. Sure, XPEL has displayed a history of growth, but near-term macroeconomic uncertainties regarding tariff concerns are worth monitoring. XPEL must consider how to react to such challenges since their distributor is based in China. For the reasons noted above, we still believe XPEL is a compelling BUY. It offers long-term sustainable growth, strategic partnerships, international expansion, and a strong balance sheet.",TSLA,Tesla

2025-01-19,20:41:26,stocks,"Apple Is Unlikely to Buy Sonos, But Amazon or Spotify Might Consider It",">The woes of speaker maker Sonos have raised the prospect of a takeover, but who might want to buy it? 

>

>For months, Sonos Inc. has been reeling. After a disastrous software rollout last year, the audio technology company that some used to call “the Apple of speakers” remains mired in the biggest crisis in its two-decade history.

>

>It all started in May when the company introduced a revamped app — the software that lets customers control their speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, headphones and other devices. The app was designed to modernize the Sonos experience and lay the groundwork for new types of products, such as the Ace headphones. But it lacked vital features and was hobbled by bugs, turning the simple act of using Sonos equipment into a nightmare.

>

>The missing features — including the sleep timer, advanced music queues, alarms, and functions related to searching and navigating music libraries — have mostly been restored. But users have reported that glitches persist in some cases: Devices don’t pair, audio volume will spike without warning, connections fail, and streaming doesn’t always go smoothly.

>

>Sonos should have never launched the new app the way it did and was aware of many bugs prior to the initial release. It should have kept around the old and reliable S2 app and launched the new version as a beta test. Once the revamped software became as dependable as the old app, Sonos could have moved forward with the new version as the default. Of course, that would have provided less of a splashy marketing opportunity — the chance to flip the switch on a whole new experience.

>

>So here we are. The new app ended up being devastating to employee morale, company revenue and the brand’s reputation. It’s a disaster on par with Apple’s rocky move to its own Maps software from Google in 2012 — a switch that led to the ouster of the company’s software chief. The big difference is that, for Apple, Maps is one app. For Sonos, the change compromised the software underpinning all its products.

>

>Sonos’ board ultimately needed to take action. More than six months after the launch of the app — and even after an apology tour from its executives and a multitude of attempted fixes — the company parted ways with Chief Executive Officer Patrick Spence a week ago. The next day, it also cut loose its chief product officer, who many Sonos employees blamed for the app mess.

>

>In their place is interim CEO Tom Conrad, a co-creator of music streaming service Pandora and former executive at Snap Inc. He has served on the Sonos board since 2017 and was already helping with the app recovery effort. Though the company has vowed to search the globe for a new full-time CEO, many Sonos staffers believe Conrad has the inside track to get the job — if he wants it.

>

>But with Sonos’ market valuation hovering around $1.7 billion — down from more than $5 billion during a pandemic-fueled rally — the board will probably consider whether selling the company makes more sense.

>

>Apple has long been seen as a potential suitor, given the two companies’ similarities. Sonos is focused on premium design with a tightly controlled ecosystem — just like Apple. They share a penchant for audio technology, and their corporate cultures have some overlap.

>

>Apple could snap up Sonos for $2 billion or so — less than it paid for Beats — and it would only cost them a few days’ worth of revenue. Sonos’ hardware could also shore up Apple’s disappointing HomePod and home audio lineup.

>

>But I don’t believe Apple will ever acquire Sonos. If Apple really wanted to build out its home audio business, it already has the hardware, software, content and manufacturing chops internally. It’s just about wanting to get things done properly — something that Apple is already working on. Later this year, it will launch its own home hub and a new HomePod mini.

>

>The only things it would gain from Sonos are a user base, a collection of patents and the employees — none of which Apple needs. Sonos’ software is obviously something Apple wouldn’t want, especially in its current state, and audio hardware has become heavily commoditized.

>

>Other potential suitors, such as Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp., wouldn’t make much sense either. Meta has all but exited the smart home, choosing to focus on AI and wearables instead. Google has a painful history with Sonos involving patent lawsuits. And Microsoft has increasingly scaled back its interest in non-Xbox hardware in recent years.

>

>Still, there are some major technology companies that might consider the idea. That list includes [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Roku Inc. and Spotify Technology SA.

>

>Amazon seems like the most natural fit. With former Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay now leading its hardware efforts, the expectation is that Amazon will revamp its device lineup and shift toward more upscale offerings. Sonos’ speakers already work with the entire streaming music industry and are certainly high-end.

>

>Sonos’ premium technology could be the basis for a series of new Amazon Echo devices running the upcoming AI-infused Alexa digital assistant. It would also help Amazon expand into new areas, such as over-ear headphones and soundbars — two categories the company has explored in the past.

>

>Amazon could certainly afford to buy Sonos, though it would have to overcome regulatory hurdles. Don’t forget: Amazon had to back out of a deal to buy Roomba maker iRobot Corp. after the European Union threatened to block the acquisition.

>

>A European company like Spotify might have an easier time getting a deal cleared. The streaming music service has championed the idea of hardware products that can run services from several different players, which Sonos does well. Spotify has long wanted to get into hardware but struggled to make it happen. Sonos would give them an instant entry, with an excellent range of products that could run its audio services.

>

>Roku is another possibility, though it would probably face antitrust concerns. After all, the company already sells a set of low-end soundbars and TV speakers. If it could make a deal work, Roku would get higher-end products that can potentially command higher profit margins. One caveat: This may need to be a stock-based deal given Roku doesn’t have as much cash on hand as its bigger rivals.

>

>Samsung is a wild card. The company already sells soundbars and subwoofers and even acquired the Harman brand in 2017. But it’s failed to crack the home speaker space. It announced an Echo-like speaker called the Galaxy Home several years ago but never actually brought it to market. Sonos would help it create a more consumer-focused line of home audio gear and provide more modern technology for its home theater products.

>

>For consumers, the best scenario is probably Sonos figuring things out and remaining independent — the current goal of the company. With the world’s biggest tech giants expanding into every facet of our lives, there is something appealing about an independent brand that plays nice with all the platforms. It’s just unclear how long Sonos will be able to do it alone.

>

>Retail inventory of the current iPhone SE quickly shrinks ahead of new model’s debut. One of Apple’s most significant new products this year will be the the iPhone SE’s replacement. The device — codenamed V59 — will mark the beginning of Apple’s transition from Qualcomm Inc. cellular modem chips to silicon designed in-house. It also means the company will no longer sell an iPhone with the now-antiquated home button. The latest model, which will also add Apple Intelligence, is set to launch by the spring — and there are signs Apple is gearing up for the release.

>

>According to people working in Apple’s retail operations, a surprisingly large number of US stores have little to no inventory of the iPhone SE remaining. Consumers can still get the device from the online store — and it ships out within a few days — but finding one at a brick-and-mortar outlet is going to be harder and harder. Apple also has ceased sales of the current SE in the European Union because the device lacks the now-required USB-C port.

>

>The drawing down of inventory is a reliable sign that a new model is coming. But it also suggests that Apple probably won’t keep the current version around — at a reduced price — after the update is here. That seems like a missed opportunity, since a cheap iPhone could’ve helped Apple make inroads in some markets. The current SE costs $429, and the new one might be more than that given its enhanced features.

>

>This new iPhone isn’t the only big product update on the horizon. As I wrote last week, look out for upcoming MacBook Airs with the M4 “Donan” chip, as well as fresh low-end iPads, iPad Airs and new Magic Keyboards in the not-too-distant future.

>

>Apple is bringing AI to Mac Mail app in macOS 15.4, even as it scales back notification summaries in iOS 18.3. The Apple Intelligence rollout is continuing with the release of macOS 15.3 in a few weeks. For the first time, Apple is bringing its Genmoji custom emoji to the Mac — following their debut on the iPhone and iPad. The company will add more features by April with iOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4. The big addition at that time will be the new Siri digital assistant, which will be able to better tap into personal information and use the App Intents technology to more precisely control apps.

>

>But there’s another, more under-the-radar feature coming in April as well: The Mac will get the upgraded Mail app that uses AI to prioritize messages and sort content into different inboxes. Right now, iPad and iPhone users are able to tap into the feature — which is terrific — but Mac customers have been left behind. That changes with macOS 15.4, I’m told. For those not familiar with the feature: It sorts mail into a primary category, as well as ones for transactions, promotions, updates and all mail.

>

>In other Apple Intelligence news, the company is scaling back notification summaries in iOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3. For months, news organizations and users have been complaining about incorrect or misleading notifications from Apple Intelligence. Rather than quickly fixing its AI models, Apple is simply pulling the plug on summaries from news and entertainment apps. You can also more easily disable summaries from the lock screen, and recaps are now italicized.

>Apple’s ex-chief people officer lands at HP. It’s not easy to join Apple after a career outside the company. The place is run by big personalities like Tim Cook, Phil Schiller, Greg Joswiak and others who have been there for several decades. In other words, if you’re walking into Apple thinking you’re going to change how it operates, you’re in for a surprise.

>

>That was the case with Carol Surface, who joined Apple in 2023 as chief people officer after working at Medtronic Plc, Best Buy Co. and PepsiCo Inc. She flamed out after less than two years. Stella Low, Apple’s short-lived vice president of communications, ran into similar issues in 2022.

>

>Both women were hired by Cook himself and stayed at Apple for way less time than anticipated, but now they have another thing in common: They landed at HP Inc. afterward. Low joined the computer maker as its chief communications officer in 2022 and recently left. Surface just agreed to join HP and is starting March 24. Given Surface’s successful and varied human resources career prior to Apple, she could end up being a good fit for HP.

>

>Speaking of Apple’s insidery culture: It was no surprise that Surface’s role was ultimately filled by Deirdre O’Brien, her predecessor and a 30-plus-year veteran of the company. Low, meanwhile, was replaced by Kristin Huguet, a member of Apple’s PR department since before the original iPhone went on sale.

>

>They’re both capable leaders, but Apple will eventually need to figure out how to bring in more talent from the outside. Right now, the company isn’t always built to handle fresh ideas from newcomers. With Apple’s need to innovate and find new sources of revenue, that might be a problem in the not-too-distant future.

>

**The Schedule**

>Jan. 22 — Samsung unveils Galaxy S25 line. Samsung is set to announce its Galaxy S25 smartphone lineup at its Unpacked event this week in San Jose, California. This year’s devices aren’t expected to get a major hardware overhaul, with the company instead focusing more on software and artificial intelligence features. But Samsung aims to show that it has an edge over Apple in this area. Stay tuned for coverage of Unpacked this week, including all of the details of the new devices. And if you’re waiting for news on Samsung smartwatches and foldable phones, those will likely debut later in the year.

>

>Jan. 30 — Apple’s first-quarter results. The earnings report — the first under Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh — will give details of Apple’s all-important holiday season. Investors will get an idea of how the iPhone 16 is selling, as well as updated AirPods and Apple Watches. The company also should provide the first real sense of whether the Apple Intelligence AI platform is spurring consumers to upgrade their devices. Wall Street is looking for about $124 billion in revenue during the period, a 4% gain from a year earlier.

>

>**Post Game Q&A**

>Q: Why is Tim Cook attending the Trump inauguration?

>A: Many Apple employees are none too pleased that their CEO is heading to Washington to kiss the ring and attend Trump’s swearing-in event on Monday. (Cook also personally donated $1 million to the inauguration fund.) The move seems to clash with Apple’s support of diversity, immigration and other progressive causes — ones that Cook himself has championed. But it’s equally clear that Apple may need Trump’s help over the next four years as it contends with tariffs, the Justice Department antitrust case and mounting pressure from the European Union. Cook likely believes Trump can alleviate these problems. He’s also not alone in turning out for the president-elect. Most of the world’s most valuable tech companies are sending a high-profile leader to the event.

>

>Q: When are the new Powerbeats Pro 2 launching?

>A: The latest earbuds from Apple’s Beats subsidiary are due imminently. The new accessory has already been submitted to the Federal Communications Commission and other regulators for approval, and the company is gearing up for a press briefing in a week or so to go over the details of the new product. The upgrades will feature a smaller overall design and improvements like Spatial Audio and enhanced noise cancellation that are already available on AirPods. The programming code within iOS also suggests that these earbuds could be capable of collecting heart-rate data from a wearer. I’ve previously reported that Apple is working on this technology and actively testing it.

>

>Q: Why is Apple starting to use US-made chips?

>A: A major, under-discussed risk facing Apple right now is that practically 100% of its advanced processors are made in Taiwan by partner TSMC. If Taiwan goes down for whatever reason (a political crisis, natural disaster or something else), Apple is in big trouble with no real plan B. That’s why moving more production to other areas is so critical, and such a shift is now underway. TSMC is running test production of lower-end Apple chips at a facility in Arizona, the first step toward more ambitious goals. Over time, Apple hopes to get chips from other factories in the US and elsewhere, including Europe. Let’s face it, the company has been fairly lucky so far that its chip production hasn’t suffered major hiccups. Apple’s reliance on one geographic location for the most important component in its devices has been a major hazard for years.

2025-01-19,19:43:38,stocks,Thoughts on ticktok ban and how would it impact meta stocks (worth shorting meta stocks?),"It seems like a significant number of TikTok users are growing frustrated with platforms like Facebook and Messenger, with many potentially rage-quitting or deleting these apps altogether. Considering TikTok’s massive user base—about 1 billion globally and 170 million in the U.S.—even a fraction of this shift could create a noticeable impact on Meta.

The question is, how might this trend affect Meta’s stock? On one hand, Meta has faced declines before and adapted through diversification and innovations like Instagram Reels. On the other, losing younger users—key to ad revenue—could hurt them long-term, especially with TikTok growing as a major competitor.

While Meta’s resources and global reach may help cushion the blow, the perception of a mass exodus could still shake investor confidence. Is this a temporary issue Meta can counter, or could it signal a deeper shift in the social media landscape? What do you think?",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2025-01-19,01:09:54,stocks,The great scam market ,"I posted a similar Topic in a couple of other subs yesterday but Mods were quickly removing them  on the basis that the question was too "" subjective "" 

  
Anyway I've been working on a theory for a few years now that the markets have very very little to do with actual company performance or metrics and everything to do about Mass perception and psychology 

  
Almost every day now I see a trader trying to analyse a stock based on a Shiller ratio or a Buffet Indicator or pattern whatever ...

  
Are we really going to kid ourselves the markets are trading on these metrics anymore !?! if so how do we explain Big Tech ? most of the valuations defy every piece of logical or rational explanation

  
A share price can move more on 4 lines of text from an individual on a social media site than on a full quarters earnings report 

  
Then allow me to move into day trading which is perhaps the most manipulated aspect of the entire show , we've known since the dawn of time Tutes and Hedges have the upper hand but now I believe with A.I trading algorithms thats been taken to a level whereby there's literal fraud happening on a daily basis

If you think this is crazy conspiracy level stuff try researching algorithmic and cryptographic trading signals

These theories and technology's speculate that these trading Algos can now actually communicate between each other via a certain price signal and then work together to shift the market higher or lower 

You can't beat this , yea you can get lucky and maybe be on the right side of the coin when it happens but generally over a sustained period these are cleverly programmed to bleed day traders out and to often go against Mass assumption 

This explains the very odd situation whereby sometimes a company gets bad news the stock actually ends up trading higher and vice versa. This is a strange Phenomenon most traders can never explain or comprehend so its often passed of as "" oh markets just being irrational"" 

No that's a lie its being done intentionally to Fvck the opposite positions 

Tesla is a fantastic example of everything I've talked about above really the daily and weekly price movement needs to investigated by the SEC for securities fraud ( it won't) but I believe a deep forensic analysis would uncover a body of manipulation and fraud 

Long term we all know the overall stock market will keep going higher and higher forever which I guess means locking capital in for 40 years into ETF's  makes the most sense , but again the big boys know dam well Retail gets impatient and wants faster gain and will try to make daily / weekly or monthly trades

( more market phsychology ) 

  
Theres a lot of FOMO out there now too which further exacerbates many traders need to get in on the action 

  
This is exactly what Tutes/ Hedges and Banks want ......it's their bread and butter 

Anyway looking forward to hearing others opinions , I'm not particularly interested in discussing if this is a conspiracy or not because frankly its brutally obvious a lot of this is happening in some context and you would be very very Naive to think otherwise 

 But maybe I have some angles or aspects wrong or maybe I've missed something somebody else wants to add

2025-01-14,18:57:30,stocks,Meta announces 5% cuts in preparation for 'intense year' — Read the internal memo,"Meta is set to cut about 5% of its workforce, focusing on the company’s lowest-performing staffers, CNBC confirmed Tuesday.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg informed employees about the decision to “move out low performers faster” in a memo posted on the company’s internal Workplace forum on Tuesday. Zuckerberg told employees 2025 will “be an intense year.”

The company specified that it is “exiting approximately 5% of our lowest performers” in a separate message posted by a company director. The company has more than 72,000 employees, according to its most recent quarterly report.

Meta said employees affected by the cuts will be notified by Feb. 10 and receive severance in line with what the company has provided previously. The cuts represent Meta’s largest layoffs since the company eliminated 21,000 jobs, or nearly a quarter of its workforce, in 2022 and 2023.

Bloomberg was first to report the cuts, citing an internal memo.

The move follows several major operational changes within Meta aimed at building closer ties with President-elect Donald Trump.

Last week, Zuckerberg announced Meta would end its third-party fact-checking program in favor of a “Community Notes” model used on Elon Musk’s platform X, where individual users provide more context to posts.

“The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech, so we’re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms,” Zuckerberg said in a video announcement.

Below is Zuckeberg’s internal memo, which CNBC obtained:

""Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.

I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle, with the intention of back filling these roles in 2025. We won’t manage out everyone who didn’t meet expectations for the last period if we’re optimistic about their future performance, and for those we do let go, we’ll provide generous severance in line with what we provided with previous cuts. 

We’ll follow up with more guidance for managers ahead of calibrations. People who are impacted will be notified on February 10 or later for those outside the U.S.""

2025-01-14,01:21:10,stocks,China Discusses Sale of TikTok US to Musk as One Possible Option,"Bloomberg: Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.

Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent ByteDance Ltd., the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on Jan. 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trump’s administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.

A potential high-profile deal with one of Trump’s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump’s re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.

Under one scenario that’s been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk’s X — the former Twitter — would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X’s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.

Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It’s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It’s also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.

Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk posted in April that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. “In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,” he wrote on X. “Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.”

ByteDance and TikTok representatives didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China’s Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok’s future, also didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok’s fate may no longer be in ByteDance’s sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.

The Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company’s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing’s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok’s valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.

TikTok’s US operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That’s a substantial sum even for the world’s richest person. It’s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.

Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his Tesla Inc. business, the person added.

ByteDance’s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok’s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution’s First Amendment.

A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban — which takes effect Jan. 19 — so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to “save” the app and there’s been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.

On a practical level, spinning off TikTok’s US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be “extraordinarily difficult.”

It’s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O’Leary has said he discussed with Trump. In the past, Microsoft Corp. had sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company.

One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app — with different branding — to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It’s not clear how effective such a move would be.

One person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.

Musk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world’s richest person with businesses that straddle the world’s two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company’s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.

While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration’s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.

One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app — with different branding — to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It’s not clear how effective such a move would be.

One person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.

Musk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world’s richest person with businesses that straddle the world’s two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company’s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.

While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration’s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.

**Thoughts:** Obviously this type of news has the ability to move TSLA/META/social networks. We've seen TSLA make moves from political news, SpaceX news, Twitter news, and TSLA trades as a proxy to whatever Elon Musk is doing at the time even if it's not directly applicable to TSLA as a company.

2025-01-12,19:44:23,stocks,S&P’s $18 Trillion Rally Threatened by Psychology of 5% Yields,">For years it’s seemed like nothing could stop the stock market’s inexorable march higher, as the S&P 500 Index soared more than 50% from the start of 2023 to the end of 2024, adding $18 trillion in value in the process. Now, however, Wall Street is seeing what can ultimately derail this rally: Treasury yields above 5%.

>Equities traders have shrugged off the bond market’s warnings for months, focusing instead on the windfall from President-elect Donald Trump’s promised tax cuts and the seemingly limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence. But the risk came into focus last week as Treasury yields climbed toward their ominous milestones and share prices sank in response.

>The yield on 20-year US Treasuries breached 5% on Wednesday and jumped back above on Friday, reaching the highest since Nov. 2, 2023. Meanwhile, 30-year US Treasuries briefly crossed 5% on Friday to the highest since Oct. 31, 2023. Those yields have risen roughly 100 basis points since mid-September, when the Federal Reserve started reducing the fed funds rate, which has come down 100 basis points over the same time.

>“It is unusual,” Jeff Blazek, co-CIO of multi-asset strategies at Neuberger Berman, said of the dramatic and rapid jump in bond yields in the early months of an easing cycle. Over the past 30 years, intermediate and longer-term yields have been relatively flat or modestly higher in the months after the Fed initiated a string of rate cuts, he added.

>Traders are watching the policy-sensitive 10-year Treasury yield, which is the highest it’s been since October 2023 and is rapidly approaching 5%, a level they fear could spark a stock market correction. It last passed the threshold briefly in October 2023, and before that you have to go back to July 2007.

>“If the 10-year hits 5% there will be a knee-jerk reaction to sell stocks,” said Matt Peron, Janus Henderson’s global head of solutions. “Episodes like this take weeks or maybe a few months to play out, and over the course of that the S&P 500 could get to down 10%.”

>The reason is fairly simple. Rising bond yields make returns on Treasuries more attractive, while also increasing the cost of raising capital for companies.

>The spillover into the stock market was apparent on Friday, as the S&P 500 tumbled 1.5% for its worst day since mid-December, turned negative for 2025, and came close to wiping out all the gains from the November euphoria sparked by Trump’s election.

>While there’s “no magic” to the fixation on 5% beyond round-number psychology, perceived barriers can create “technical barriers,” said Kristy Akullian, Blackrock’s head of iShares investment strategy. Meaning, a swift move in yields can make it difficult for stocks to rise.

>Investors are already seeing how. The earnings yield for the S&P 500 is sitting 1 percentage point below what’s offered by 10-year Treasuries, a development last seen in 2002. In other words, the return on owning a significantly less risky asset than the US equities benchmark hasn’t been this good in a long time.

>“Once yields get higher it becomes harder and harder to rationalize valuation levels,” said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede Trust. “And if earnings growth starts to falter, there can be issues.”

>Not surprisingly, strategists and portfolio managers predict a bumpy road ahead for stocks. Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson anticipates a tough six months for equities, while Citigroup’s wealth division told clients there’s a buying opportunity in bonds.

>The path to 5% on the 10-year Treasury became more realistic on Friday after strong jobs data caused economists to reduce expectations for rate cuts this year. But this isn’t just about the Fed. The selloff in bonds is global and based on sticky inflation, hawkish central banks, ballooning government debts, and extreme uncertainties presented by the incoming Trump administration.

>“When you’re in hostile waters, yields above 5% is where all bets are off,” Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert, said.

>What equity investors need to know now is if, and when, serious buyers step in.

>“The real question is where we go from there,” said Rick de los Reyes, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. “If it’s 5% on its way to 6% then that’s going to get people concerned, if it’s 5% before stabilizing and ultimately going lower then things will be fine.”

>Red Flags

>The key isn’t so much that yields are rising, but why, market pros say. A slow increase as the US economy improves can help stocks. But a quick jump due to concerns about inflation, the federal deficit and policy uncertainty is a red flag.

>In recent years, whenever yields have risen quickly, stocks have sold off. The difference this time appears to be complacent investors, as seen in bullish positioning in the face of frothy valuations and uncertainties about Trump’s policies. And that’s putting equities in a vulnerable position.

>“When you look at rising prices, a strong job market and an overall strong economy, it all points to a possible uptick in inflation,” said Eric Diton, president of the Wealth Alliance. “And that’s not even including Trump’s policies.”

>One area that may prove to be a haven for equity investors is the group that’s been driving most of the gains these past few years: Big Tech. The so-called Magnificent Seven companies — Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. — are still posting rapid earnings growth and massive cash flows. Plus, looking to the future, they’re expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence revolution.

>“Investors typically seek high quality stocks with strong balance sheets and strong cash flows during market turmoil,” said Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth. “The mega techs have become part of that defensive play recently.”

>That’s the hope many equity investors are hanging on, that mega-cap tech companies’ sway over the broader market and their relative security will limit any weakness in the stock market. The Magnificent Seven have a more than 30% weighting in the S&P 500.

>At the same time, the Fed is in the midst of lowering interest rates, although the pace is likely going to be slower than expected. That makes this a very different situation than 2022, when the Fed was hiking rates rapidly and indexes plunged.

>Still, many Wall Street pros are urging investors to proceed cautiously for the time being as rate risk hits in various unexpected ways.

>“The companies in the S&P 500 that are up the most will probably be the most vulnerable — and that could include the Mag Seven — and some frothy areas of mid-cap and small-cap growth will likely be under pressure,” said Janus Henderson’s Peron. “We’ve been consistent across our firm on staying focused on quality and being valuation sensitive. That will be very important in the coming months.”

2025-01-11,17:59:32,stocks,Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg trash talks Apple in interview,"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24341039/meta-apple-mark-zuckerberg-trash-talks-joe-rogan-interview

> Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks Apple “[hasn’t] really invented anything great in a while” and that it has been coasting off of its past success. “Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,” he said this week. Zuckerberg made the statements during a nearly three-hour long podcast with Joe Rogan where, along with discussing Meta’s moderation policy changes and turn against diversity and inclusion policies, they got into Meta’s beef with Apple and its policies.

> The conversation actually started with Rogan’s issues with Apple. Rogan said he’s moving “from Apple to Android” in part because he doesn’t “like being attached to one company.” He also isn’t a fan of Apple’s App Store policies. “The way they do that Apple store, where they charge people 30 percent,” he said. “That seems so insane that they can get away with doing that.” “I have some opinions about this,” Zuckerberg said. While he gives credit to the iPhone as “obviously one of the most important inventions probably of all time,” he argued that Apple has put rules in place that “feel arbitrary.” Zuckerberg said that Apple has “thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way” as Apple’s own products, like the AirPods. If Apple let other people use its protocol, “there would probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there,” Zuckerberg said.

> Down the line, Zuckerberg envisions a world where you’ll be able to use the neural interface wristband and the glasses to text a friend or an AI and have the glasses give you the answer. He also believes that as smart glasses or even contact lenses as a computing platform become more developed, the internet will be “overlaid” on the physical world. “I think we’ll basically be in this wild world where most of the world will be physical, but there will be this increasing amount of virtual objects or people who are beaming in or hologramming into different things to interact in different ways,” he said. “There isn’t a physical world and a digital world anymore,” he added. “We’re in 2025. It’s one world.”",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2025-01-10,18:14:34,stocks,"Contrarian alert: Uber’s missing the AI wave, yet it looks promising.","So, after Travis Kalanick got ousted, Dara Khosrowshahi stepped in and turned Uber from a “wartime” to a “peacetime” company. He cleaned up the culture mess, shoved aside long-term moonshots (like Uber’s self-driving unit) and put the company on a strict path to profitability (as expected from a former Wall Street banker).

Despite getting smacked by COVID and high interest rates, Uber tightened its belt, doubled down on demand-supply matchmaking, and came out profitable. Wall Street went nuts. Uber is now FCF-positive and aiming for even higher margins. 

**So what is Uber today?**

Dara says they’re laser-focused on nailing that perfect supply-demand match. Sure, they’re winning in mobility and they might tackle new verticals like Fiverr-style marketplaces. Sounds great, except they’re missing out on the biggest opportunity of our era, which is motherfucking **AI.**

Uber collects **11B trips** a year from **160M users**, racking up insane amounts of data (driver reviews, food reviews, social patterns across countless cities etc). This could’ve made them a self-driving powerhouse. But they ditched their autonomous unit in 2020 to cut costs, just as NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang now shows off new automotive processors and partnerships with Toyota, Aurora (who bought Uber’s AV unit), and Volvo. **Uber’s name is nowhere on that list!!!**

No matter how you spin it, a simple “supply-demand” marketplace could get overshadowed once autonomous vehicles go mainstream. Especially when you already own the infrastructure for ride-hailing, food delivery, scooters and bikes.

**Investors might be licking their chops (at least I would do it If I were them)** at two big plays:

1. **Pull a Reddit:** Sell anonymized data for LLM training and get lots of money, further increasing margins. Instantly, Uber gets an “AI play.” 
2. **Sell to Tesla or Google:** Supercharge someone else’s AV ambitions (as well as their foundation models) and get a fat premium in the process.

Meanwhile, the stock still looks undervalued. Uber’s **LTM P/FCF** is around **22.6x**, PEG is **under 1.0x** (Peter Lynch territory), and a Reverse DCF suggests they only need **9.2% revenue growth** (at \~12.4% margins) over 10 years to justify the current price. That’s totally doable.

Here’s how I see it playing out:

1. **Best case:** Tesla or Google acquires them this year and we get a solid premium payday. Probably a stock deal, but it’s still peanuts compared to Tesla and Google market caps. 
2. **Second best:** Uber pivots to selling AI training data. 
3. **Not bad either:** Uber dominates more human-driven marketplaces. 
4. **Base scenario:** They stick to mobility, keep expanding margins, and *maybe* bolt on third-party AVs .

2025-01-09,15:18:31,stocks,Amazon to Let Retailers Use Its Ad Tools on Their Own Stores,">Amazon has turned into an online ad juggernaut in recent years, with brands paying big bucks for premium placement on the retailer’s websites. Now, Amazon is letting other sites use its ad technology for their own stores.

>The new offering, called Amazon Retail Ad Service, allows companies to show “contextually relevant ads in the right place and at the right time” in search results, product pages and other areas of their site, Amazon said Thursday.

>It’s initially available for U.S. retailers, which will pay fees based on usage levels. Prices weren’t disclosed.

>Amazon in 2022 began breaking out ad revenue in its quarterly earnings reports, showing that the business had become a significant contributor to the company’s top and bottom lines. Ad revenue in the latest quarter came in at $14.3 billion, third to Alphabet and Meta in digital advertising.

>That’s still much less than the sales Amazon generates from online stores and cloud computing, which came to $61.4 billion and $27.4 billion, respectively, in the quarter that ended in October.

>The bulk of Amazon’s ad revenue comes from sponsored product advertisements, which are keyword-targeted ads that let brands promote certain items. Amazon has stuffed more of these sponsored items into search results and product pages over time. It also generates some ad revenue through streaming.

>With Amazon Retail Ad Service, users will be able to customize the design, placement and number of ads shown across their sites, as well as use Amazon’s ad measurement and reporting tools.

>The service could provide Amazon with valuable data it can use to bolster its ad prediction and recommendation technology. The company said early customers include health and wellness retailer iHerb, Asian grocery startup Weee! and Oriental Trading Co., which sells toys, party and craft supplies.

>“We’ve designed this to be a win for retailers, advertisers, and shoppers, and we look forward to seeing how it improves outcomes, drives sales and enhances the shopping experience,” said Paula Despins, vice president of Amazon Ads Measurement, in the press release.

>The announcement comes a few days before the National Retail Federation’s annual trade show.

>It’s not the first time Amazon has sold its in-house technology and services to third parties.

>Amazon Web Services began as cloud infrastructure to support its online retail business. The company launched AWS as a business in 2006. In 2022, the company launched Buy With Prime, which combines Amazon’s payment and fulfillment services for other retailers.

Two Israeli companies, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Wix.com, have been selected as top picks for 2025 by leading US analysts.

Bank of America included Teva in its biopharma survey, highlighting the company’s strong performance and potential for continued growth. Teva, which is led by CEO Richard Francis, saw its stock rise by 111% in 2024 and now has a market cap of $24.6 billion. Bank of America raised its price target for Teva shares from $25 to $26, citing positive financial results, plans to sell its active ingredients division, and significant debt reduction efforts. Additionally, the success of duvakitug, a drug for inflammatory bowel disease co-developed with Sanofi, boosted investor confidence after strong Phase 2 trial results. Analysts believe Teva's strong product pipeline and turnaround strategy leave room for further price increases.

In the Internet sector, Cantor Fitzgerald selected Wix.com as a top pick alongside major players like Meta, Amazon, and DoorDash. Wix, under the leadership of CEO Avishai Abrahami, saw its stock rise by 74% in 2024, bringing its market cap to $12.1 billion. Cantor Fitzgerald raised its price target for Wix shares from $240 to $260, emphasizing the company's robust roadmap, pricing strength, and new AI product launches. Analysts believe these factors will drive growth and expand Wix’s trading multiples. Furthermore, Wix is seen as a potential acquisition target, adding to its attractiveness for investors.

2025-01-07,14:35:58,stocks,"Meta scraps fact checking program, is bringing back political content","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/07/meta-eliminates-third-party-fact-checking-moves-to-community-notes.html

Meta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact checking program to “restore free expression” and move to a “Community Notes” model, similar to the system that exists on Elon Musk’s platform X.

The company said Community Notes will be written and rated by contributing users to provide more context to posts across its platforms, and the feature will roll out in the U.S. over the next couple of months. The announcement marks Meta’s latest attempt to smooth over relations with Republican President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office.

“We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes, and too much censorship,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Tuesday in a video announcement. “The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech, so we’re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms.”

Zuckerberg said the third-party fact checkers have been “too politically biased” and have “destroyed more trust than they’ve created, especially in the U.S.”

Meta said it will simplify its content policies by removing restrictions on subjects like immigration and gender and implement a new approach to policy enforcement that will focus on illegal and high severity violations. The company is moving its trust and safety and content moderation teams from California, a historically Democratic state, to Texas, a historically Republican state.

“We’re going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more,” Zuckerberg said.

Joel Kaplan, Meta’s head of global policy, appeared on “Fox and Friends” Tuesday and said Meta thinks the Community Notes system on Musk’s platform X has been working “really well.” Musk, who has been a vocal advocate for Trump online and donated millions of dollars to his campaign, has been in close contact with the president-elect since the election.

Last week, Meta said that Kaplan would become the company’s top policy officer, replacing Nick Clegg, who was a former British deputy prime minister and a leader of Britain’s centrist Liberal Democrats party.

Kaplan, who has held several policy related positions at Meta since joining the company in 2011 when it was still named Facebook, is well-known within the Republican party. He was a White House deputy chief of staff under former President George W. Bush and also once worked as a law clerk for former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.

In December, Kaplan revealed in a Facebook post that he joined Vice-President Elect JD Vance and Trump during their recent visit at the New York Stock Exchange.

“We want to make it so that, bottom line, if you can say it on TV, you say it on the floor of Congress, you certainly ought to be able to say it on Facebook and Instagram without fear of censorship,” Kaplan said Tuesday.

Prominent Republican lawmakers have previously criticized Meta and other technology companies for allegations regarding the censorship of conservative voices on their respective platforms. For instance, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, subpoenaed Zuckerberg and other tech CEOs in 2023 as part of a probe to “understand how and to what extent the Executive Branch coerced and colluded with companies and other intermediaries to censor speech.”

Zuckerberg has had a rocky relationship with Trump over the years, with the president-elect more recently describing Facebook as an “enemy of the people” in a March interview with CNBC. Meta levied a two-year suspension on Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts in 2021 shortly after the company determined that the former president’s actions following the Jan. 6 insurrection in Washington, D.C., could potentially incite more violence.

In 2023, Trump was able to regain access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts, but he also faced some restrictions and potential penalties if he were to violate the company’s community guidelines. Meta eventually removed Trump’s account-related restrictions in July during the lead up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

2025-01-07,04:58:24,stocks,Shares of Tencent fall 5% in Hong Kong after U.S. adds firm to list of 'Chinese military companies,"Shares of Chinese tech heavyweight Tencent Holdings tumbled 7% in Hong Kong after the company was added to a list of “Chinese military companies” by the U.S. Department of Defense.

The move follows a near 8% fall in Tencent’s U.S. depository receipts on Wall Street.

Other Chinese companies added to the list included battery maker CATL, which is part of the supply chain for automakers such as Ford and Tesla.

CATL shares, which fell as much as 5.6%, were last down 2.8% in Shenzhen.

The National Defence Authorization Act of 2024 says that the DoD will be prohibited from procuring goods or services directly from entities on the list in June 2026, and indirectly from June 2027.

In response to the decision, Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was “clearly a mistake.”

“We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business,” the company added.

CATL also called the designation “a mistake” in a response, saying it “is not engaged in any military related activities.”

The U.S. has taken aim at Chinese tech companies in its bid to restrict transfer of high-end technologies to China. Last year, it revoked certain licenses to sell chips to China’s Huawei in May and unveiling new sweeping export controls on critical technologies in September, including quantum computing and semiconductor goods.

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security said companies must apply for a license if they want to sell certain advanced computing semiconductors or related manufacturing equipment to China.

“I’ve never been interested in joining a board of directors until I got the offer to join Meta’s board,” White added in a statement. “I am a huge believer that social media and AI are the future.”

“I am very excited to join this incredible team and to learn more about this business from the inside,” he added. “There is nothing I love more than building brands, and I look forward to helping take Meta to the next level.”

White joins John Elkann, the CEO of European investment firm Exor, and the executive chairman of Ferrari, and Charlie Songhurst, a veteran technology investor, on the board.

Zuckerberg and White are friendly, with the Facebook founder an occasional guest at UFC matches. Zuckerberg has also trained with UFC fighters, and competed in local MMA bouts in California.

White is also very close with incoming President Trump, who Zuckerberg and other tech moguls have tried to forge a relationship with ahead of his second term.

2025-01-04,22:32:12,stocks,Electrification Is Disrupting The Global Economy. Wolfspeed's SiC Is Among The Best Investments For This Energy Transition.,"Energy Transition is happening on a massive scale and it's upending traditional energy markets. China is leading the world in electrification which is disrupting large parts of the world economy. Wolfspeed's SiC is one of the best ways to invest in this unstoppable energy revolution.

China's forward-thinking accomplishments deserve our admiration and gratitude. Their investments are benefiting the entire planet and future technology of society. We need to keep up with their innovation and progress in the most peaceful and mutually beneficial ways possible.

China leads in energy generation, transmission, transportation and storage. Power semiconductors are the main technology where they are still lagging behind. With global adversarial tensions surrounding semiconductor technologies, they will be independently produced as much as possible. The top shelf SiC market is unlikely to face serious Chinese competition anytime soon.

[EVs are reaching cost parity with ICE](https://evboosters.com/ev-charging-news/electric-vehicles-now-cheaper-than-combustion-models-in-china/) vehicles in China. EVs will be cheaper to purchase, have lower operating costs, and offer better performance. The technology is being applied to all transportation.

[Freight](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-semi-efficiency-3000-mile-dhl/) and [fleet shipping will be electric](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2022/1220-usps-intends-to-deploy-over-66000-electric-vehicles-by-2028.htm). Most [marine shipping will be electric](https://english.elpais.com/climate/2024-10-04/the-future-of-maritime-transport-electric-ships-that-can-carry-hundreds-of-containers-and-thousands-of-people.html) with big companies like [Maersk already decarbonizing ports.](https://www.maersk.com/sustainability/our-esg-priorities/climate-change/decarbonising-port-terminals) Even most air travel will be electric as [Advanced Air Mobility](https://www.baesystems.com/en-us/definition/what-is-advanced-air-mobility) takes off. Robots, trains, buses, and almost all objects will be moved with electricity alone. Using [SiC in Power Trains](https://www.wolfspeed.com/applications/power/automotive/ev-powertrain/) is opening up many of these new markets, and making existing applications more efficient.

Fast charging is a priority with huge SiC growth opportunities both onboard vehicles and in stationary charging infrastructure. [Wolfspeed is a leader in fast charging](https://www.wolfspeed.com/applications/power/renewable-energy/fast-charging/) devices. 

[Renewable energy is the cheapest](https://www.snexplores.org/article/green-energy-cheaper-than-fossil-fuels-climate) and fastest growing source of electricity. [PV panel costs continue to drop](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06062024/inside-clean-energy-solar-panel-price-drop/), currently \~11 cents per watt worldwide, and [applications continue to expand](https://www.nrel.gov/pv/applications.html). American solar manufacturing recently jumped to [3rd biggest producer in the world.](https://seia.org/blog/american-solar-manufacturing-is-back-and-its-big/)

PV and wind need inverters and [Wolfspeed makes cutting edge devices used in inverters](https://www.wolfspeed.com/company/news-events/news/wolfspeed-unveils-cutting-edge-silicon-carbide-module-solution-to-boost-clean-energy-capacity/), chargers and battery systems. Same devices can be used on heat pumps, industrial motor drives, and induction heating. SiC increases electrical efficiency in all these applications.

The intermittent nature of renewables is being addressed with batteries and Energy Storage Systems (ESS). Costs continue to plummet with [$66/kwh batteries having huge implications](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/12/24/what-are-the-implications-of-66-kwh-battery-packs-in-china/) for the world's combustion-based energy sources.

Doing things cheaper with electricity creates less need to manage tiny explosions and burn resources.

[TSLA's Megapack growth](https://electrek.co/2025/01/03/teslas-energy-storage-business-continues-to-boom/) helped offset declining vehicle deliveries with some expecting ESS to be the bigger part of TSLA's future. They will be competing with BYD and CATL, their Megapack partner and competitor. [CATL's new containerized battery has twice the capacity](https://www.catl.com/en/news/6232.html) and better degradation performance but doesn't come with an inverter, an opportunity for SiC device manufacturers.

[ESS get better performance with SiC](https://www.wolfspeed.com/knowledge-center/article/the-value-of-using-sic-in-energy-storage-systems-ess/) components.

Almost all electrical grids need updating and better interconnection. [High Voltage Direct Current HVDC is the preferred way](https://www.energy.gov/oe/articles/connecting-country-hvdc#:~:text=HVDC%20transmission%20has%20significant%20advantages,ability%20to%20connect%20asynchronous%20systems) to transfer large voltages over distance while interconnecting different grids. [SiC will play a major role](https://www.techinsights.com/blog/prospects-commercial-high-voltage-silicon-carbide-devices-summary) in the renewal and [management of electrical grids](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2016/06/f32/04%20-%20OE%20ORNL%20Materials%20Innovation%20Workshop%20-%20Huang%20-%20small.pdf).

Even National Defense is electrifying with laser and directed energy weapons being made more effective with SiC. The [US Military has supply partnerships with Wolfspeed](https://www.romesentinel.com/news/wolfspeed-us-navy-contract-brandon-williams/article_ec34af68-4900-11ef-96ed-cba12bc570f3.html).

The technologies involved in the Energy Transition are a difficult place to invest with all the disruption, innovation and competition. Wolfspeed's SiC is an ideal long-term investment in this space. Even if Asian competition manages to close the considerable performance gap, it's unlikely that foreign made semiconductors will be allowed in such important energy infrastructure.

This news was met with positivity in the stock market, with Arcadium's shares climbing over 2% in after-hours trading.

However, the path to the deal is not without its obstacles. Arcadium is currently dealing with legal challenges from a section of its shareholders.

These shareholders have lodged lawsuits against the company, accusing it of misrepresentation, concealment, and negligence in relation to the takeover deal. This information was disclosed by Arcadium in a regulatory filing earlier this month.

Earlier in the year, Rio Tinto stated its intention to acquire Arcadium at a price of $5.85 per share, which was paid in cash. This purchase price represented a nearly 90% premium on Arcadium's closing stock price on October 4, the day a potential deal was first reported by Reuters.

The acquisition will grant Rio Tinto access to Arcadium's lithium mines, processing facilities, and deposits located in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

Additionally, Rio Tinto will also inherit Arcadium's customer base, which includes major automotive manufacturers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), BMW (ETR:BMWG), and General Motors (NYSE:GM).",TSLA,Tesla
2025-01-04,09:04:26,stocks,Is it worth it to invest time into learning technical analysis? ,"For context, I've been buying stocks and options since I turned 18 around 3 months ago, so I don't have a lot of experience or knowledge in the first place. I've just been making moves based on my own research combined with other people's ideas. I was looking through a discord where people share their ideas as I wanted to expand my portfolio past being 65% NVDA and 35% random bullshit, and I often see these pictures of daily 5 minute candles with countless horizontal, diagonal, and curvy lines. The poster then mentions various names for some candlestick patterns and says something about how the stock closed above/under the EMA or some crap then proceeds to justify their following move, seeming to have full confidence because of this chart they drew.

So I thought, if I could go by the book and use rules and numbers to get a solid guess on which way the stock's gonna go, I'd be rich. But if it were that easy, everyone would be rich. And one look through this r/wallstreetbets makes it clear that there's not a lot of people who have achieved that status.

I'm posting to ask if learning about all this is worth it. I know that the market is unpredictable and there's no way looking at a bunch of lines will give me a positive winrate, but does it help? For example, could you have a better chance at guessing what's gonna happen in the next 30 minutes if you recognized the pattern that came before it? I know that I cannot expect the book to be right all the time, but would it at least give me a better shot at it?

I haven't tried this at all and so far I've been doing fine, though I know the stuff I've bought have been nice to me in the months I've held it and I can't expect the same in the future (I started with 7k, now at 9k, with 50% of gains unrealized from mostly NVDA and RKLB, 50% of gains realized from TSLA and NVDA calls bought post-election). I know reading these patterns won't help in the long run, as I'm holding shares and am not planning to sell in the foreseeable future, but I want to understand what these people are talking about when they do TAs and try it for myself to see if it actually helps or not. Maybe try buying 0dte for SPY and QQQ to harvest some loss porn for WSB.

2024-12-30,16:54:41,stocks,The top 5 performing stocks of the past decade have one thing in common,"The five best performing stocks of the past decade Nvidia, AMD, Camtek, Fair Isaac, and Tesla  have one thing in common: their stock prices have all experienced at least one drop of 50% or more. For example, Tesla's stock dropped by more than 70%, and Nvidia experienced a 66% decline in 2022. These sharp fluctuations caused many investors to panic and sell. However, if we had sold during these major drops, we would have missed out on the subsequent huge gains



These stocks have had compound annual growth rates ranging from 40% to 75% For instance, if you had invested $10,000 in Tesla ten years ago, it would now be worth $290,000, and Nvidia return is even more impressive, with a $10,000 investment now worth nearly $2.7 million



This made me realize that an important investment principle is to ""let your winners keep winning"" While there are only a few winners in the market, if we can hold on to them in our portfolio, the returns can be very significant. However, to do this, investors need to overcome the fear of large price fluctuations and avoid selling when prices drop 

It is often only after such fluctuations that these stocks experience the next big rise



Investment guru Charlie Munger once said, ""If you can't calmly endure a 50% drop in stock prices two or three times, you're not suited to be a common shareholder"" I have come to understand that market volatility is inevitable, and investors must learn to accept significant price swings and remain calm during downturns The key is to have a clear investment thesis when buying stocks, understand the company's long term value, and compare the company’s performance to your judgment. If things are progressing as expected, holding on is usually a good idea, because it gives you confidence during market turbulence



In summary, one of the most important investment principles is to continue holding on to the stocks that are performing well, even if they experience significant volatility.

On the other hand. The intelligence commodity is really cheap now. The DeepSeek model's weights are free. And it cost only 10M to train. AI companies which invested Billions on their models, just got their models superseded by a model which is now free for everyone.

2024-12-28,04:12:44,stocks,Tesla's Genius Autonomous Strategy and Implied Supremacy,"Tesla's autonomous program FSD (Full Self-Driving) will inevitably become the prime competitor in the U.S. to Waymo, and the leader everywhere else where it is legal. I have this conviction because I can look clearly at the actual comparisons of the vehicles statistics rather than their permit level. The reason that it makes sense to ignore the permit level, is that Tesla intentionally declares their autonomous program at Level 2 Autonomy to avoid the increased regulations on testing that Level 3 or Level 4 incur. 

Essentially, what Tesla has seemingly believed from the inception of their FSD program, was that **more Data = better system**. And I agree with them. If we look at any machine learning program or deep learning that has aimed to create a high fidelity system, most of the time the **sheer scale of data has increased output quality immensely**. In deploying their FSD to independent owners who supervise it, they essentially are able to scale their data collection **without** hiring and deploying ""skilled safety testers"" like Waymo has had to in the past to collect data and train their model, giving them a huge leg up in cost efficiency and scalability. 

People don't realize how good Tesla's FSD because of Autopilot's failures. The rollout of Autopilot and the marketing of it has a lot of criticism for good reason, but Full Self-Driving may as well be a different system with how markedly different the crash rates between them are. This is also combined with the fact that **Waymo vehicles have not operated on freeways** while Tesla vehicles have. Waymo only recently began testing on freeways, which is quite insane to me because how can anyone believe that Waymo has achieved technological supremacy when they only started testing on freeways a few months ago?? 

**All of these reasons contribute to my belief that Tesla will achieve Level 5 Autonomy first**. (No Driver, no steering wheel, no pedals). Not only do they actually have a working model of the CyberCab while Waymo does not, they also now have the government aligned with them on the federal level that could provide them the ability to create regulatory guidance and permits that could benefit the public's perception and deployment of FSD. **You have all of the basic, important facts you need to see the likely outcome of the autonomous vehicle landscape, but it's up to you to cut through the noise of what news articles write about Tesla's implied supremacy here. Tesla will say it, you don't have to believe them because there's people saying otherwise, but you have all the details here and the cognitive capacity to ascertain the truth.

Nissan has been struggling under heavy debt and lackluster revenue and most recently announced significant layoffs after a 93% profit plunge. Honda can be seeing this as more of an acquisition than a merger as they aim to swoop in and help Nissan achieve a “v shaped recovery” from their recent downturn. 



The completed merger could reset the stage for major auto makers and present serious competition for American car companies. Looking forward to watching this develop and see what the impacts will be.

While there’s no direct tension yet, some news outlets have sarcastically referred to Musk as an 'unelected figure' eager to steal the spotlight, suggesting that his high-profile actions might overshadow others.

This raises the question: Is Tesla’s current rally driven by the perceived good relationship between Musk and Trump, or is it rooted in a genuine improvement in Tesla’s revenue outlook? If the rally is supported by a stronger business foundation, this speculative angle may hold little weight. Conversely, if public perception and narratives are the primary drivers, the risk of a fallout could present a case for downside potential.

Let’s start with some expert opinions I read over the weekend about Broadcom’s impressive rally views I completely agree with

At the hardware level, training costs are skyrocketing, limiting participation to a few CSP (cloud service providers) that can afford it.     As economies of scale see diminishing returns, these companies are shifting their strategies toward customer acquisition, commercialization, and retention—similar to Microsoft’s current approach.     With growing focus on model deployment and revenue generation, inference is bound to take center stage.     Open source models are becoming more valuable, enabling AI application developers to focus on building apps rather than training models from scratch.     It’s akin to the role Linux played during the cloud operating system boom.

The traditional scaling laws based on data are nearing a bottleneck.     We’re likely approaching the end of the pretraining era, with the future pointing towards the ""Agent and Reason"" age.

Here’s the key takeaway: Broadcom predicts that by 2027, its three largest existing clients (likely ByteDance, Google, and Meta) will deploy over one million arithmetic card units.     Additionally, two more clients are undergoing validation, potentially driving $60–90 billion in AI-related revenue.    That said, expectations for overall AI capital expenditure changes remain modest.

This shift represents more of a structural change in existing capital allocation.   NVIDIA, which currently dominates with over 75% of the arithmetic card market, may see its lead challenged.     Broadcom’s ASIC solutions and NVIDIA’s GPUs could eventually share the market.    Once AI models stabilize, ASIC—being application-specific—could offer a significant cost advantage over general purpose GPU.

For major cloud providers, the massive capital expenditures have sparked criticism from shareholders.     At this point, these companies must demonstrate revenue growth to justify the spending.

As I write this, AVGO  is soaring again.     Broadcom rise was anticipated, but the market sentiment is electrifying.     Investors are desperately hunting for the next NVDA.     After cashing out Tesla last week, I thought Monday might bring a big move for Tesla.     Instead, Broadcom stole the spotlight.     While Tesla did rise, it couldn’t match Broadcom momentum.

That said, expectations for overall AI capital expenditure changes remain modest.

This shift represents more of a structural change in existing capital allocation.   NVIDIA, which currently dominates with over 75% of the arithmetic card market, may see its lead challenged.     Broadcom’s ASIC solutions and NVIDIA’s GPUs could eventually share the market.    Once AI models stabilize, ASIC—being application-specific—could offer a significant cost advantage over general purpose GPU.

For major cloud providers, the massive capital expenditures have sparked criticism from shareholders.     At this point, these companies must demonstrate revenue growth to justify the spending.

As I write this, AVGO  is soaring again.     Broadcom rise was anticipated, but the market sentiment is electrifying.     Investors are desperately hunting for the next NVDA.     After cashing out Tesla last week, I thought Monday might bring a big move for Tesla.     Instead, Broadcom stole the spotlight.     While Tesla did rise, it couldn’t match Broadcom momentum.

2024-12-16,09:30:16,stocks,Tesla Bull and Bear case: the great AI and liability gamble,"Tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently, nearly doubling to $1.4T market cap in just three months. The catalyst is Trump’s victory and Elon Musk’s instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon’s influence to relax regulations, clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout—a potential game-changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole.

Tesla is trading like an AI startup, and for good reason: its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look.  


# The Bull Case: Tesla’s data volume

Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road, each equipped with a suite of cameras, Tesla’s fleet constantly collects real-world driving data. This data acts as a “shadow trainer” for its AI, gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile, FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI, providing Tesla with even more labeled data.

Behind the scenes, Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases—rare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly, Tesla’s massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume, which usually means better machine learning.On top of this, Tesla’s vision-only approach—using cameras without lidar—makes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result? A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world, not just pre-mapped areas.





# The Bear Case: Quantity vs. Quality

More data is not always better, and it’s possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments, where edge cases are relatively rare, while Waymo trains their AI in dense, chaotic urban areas.  The result is a more diverse dataset that’s constantly evolving.

Waymo is owned by Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar.  Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out, but failed, to do.  Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of, since it often conflicted with the vision data.  But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work.  This means that its data is much richer in quality.  The urban-focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla’s suburban-heavy dataset, giving its AI a potentially richer training environment.

The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre-mapped areas, Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real-world deployments today. Tesla, by comparison, is still at Level 2, which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn’t just an incremental step—it’s an order-of-magnitude leap in complexity.

Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments—places like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla’s FSD, by contrast, collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases, such as jaywalking pedestrians, aggressive lane merges, and unexpected construction detours.

As the saying goes, “If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.” If Waymo’s AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA, it’s far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast, Tesla’s suburban data might create a “same-shit-different-day” scenario, where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare, high-stakes scenarios.

# Regulatory relaxation is a double-edged sword

If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations, Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory, this could limit Tesla’s liability, especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However, accidents involving unsuspecting third parties (e.g., pedestrians) remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks, manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles, meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure, even for a small number of accidents.  Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework, courts ultimately determine liability, and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best, complicity at worst.

Tesla’s data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics—which is very impressive. However, publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because, again, L2 puts the onus on the driver.  But it's a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case, any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla, exposing them to unlimited liability.

# The scalability myth

Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo’s reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable, but this argument doesn’t hold weight for two reasons.  First, lidar is becoming much cheaper, and with volume production, costs could approach Tesla’s camera-only system.  Ironically, Elon’s first principles philosophy should be applied here: just because something was a certain way before doesn’t mean it has to be that way.  Secondly, the market for taxis in general is urban.  When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside?  Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed, giving it a more focused path to profitability.



# Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google

Waymo uses millions of AI-generated simulations to train its system. It’s AI teaching AI, similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations, but Waymo’s superior compute power (via Google’s custom TPUs) means it’s clearly dominant in this regard.

Tesla bulls often cite Elon’s dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla’s superior approach. But they overlook Google’s hegemony in AI.  They were in the game before anyone.  They delivered AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and many other paradigm-shifting, world-changing products, backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla’s Dojo may be promising, but it’s still a newbie.  
  


# tl;dr

Tesla’s $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving, which is to say its lead in AI.  If Tesla dominates AI, the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality, liability risks, and Waymo’s technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind.  In which case, it's vastly overvalued.

> Elon Musk’s net worth has reached $400 billion, according to Bloomberg, making him the first person ever to cross that mark. Behind his nearly $20 billion jump in wealth was a deal that shot up Musk’s rocket company SpaceX’s valuation to roughly $350 billion, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. SpaceX and its investors agreed to purchase as much as $1.25 billion of insider shares. Tesla shares closed at a record high on Wednesday, hitting $424.77 at market close. Musk, who is Tesla’s largest individual shareholder, has also enjoyed the stock propelling higher in part due to the broader market — NASDAQ topped 20,000 for the first time ever Wednesday. Since Election Day, the EV maker’s stock has rallied roughly 65% on investors’ belief that Musk’s influence in the Trump administration will usher in an era of deregulation that will benefit the company.

> His artificial intelligence startup, xAI, also more than doubled in value in November amid a new funding round, surging to $50 billion from a few months ago, according to the Wall Street Journal. The world’s wealthiest man is now roughly $136 billion richer since November 5, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While the top spots on the billionaires index typically switch around, Musk is racing past his wealthy peers. As of December 10, before his wealth skyrocketed to $400 billion, he was already $140 billion richer than the second-richest man on Earth, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

> Musk’s record-breaking Tesla-shareholder-approved pay package, which was worth $101 billion, was rejected by a Delaware court last week. Bloomberg’s calculation still seems to include the pay package, which is now worth as much as $120 billion based on the current value of Tesla shares.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-12-11,19:11:55,stocks,"Tesla shares climb to record, boosted by 64% pop since Trump election victory","Tesla shares jumped to an all-time high on Wednesday, surpassing their prior record reached in 2021, sparked by a post-election rally and Wall Street’s increased enthusiasm for Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company.

The stock rose to an intraday high of $415, which is 50 cents above its previous peak, and was on pace to close ahead of its highest finish, which was $409.97 on Nov. 4, 2021.

Tesla’s market value has swelled by about 66% this year, with almost all of those gains coming since Donald Trump’s election victory early last month. The stock’s 38% rally in November marked its best monthly performance since January of 2023 and its 10th best on record.

Musk poured $277 million into a pro-Trump campaign effort, according to Federal Election Commission filings, and turned his support for the Republican nominee into another full-time job ahead of the election, funding a swing-state operation to register voters and using his social media platform X to constantly tout his preferred candidate, frequently with misinformation.

The world’s richest person, who’s seen his net worth swell to over $360 billion, is set to lead the Trump administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.

His new role could give Musk power over federal agencies’ budgets, staffing and the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. Musk said during a Tesla earnings call in October that he intended to use his sway with Trump to establish a “federal approval process for autonomous vehicles.” Currently, approvals happen at the state level.

“The stock is responding to the Trump bump,” Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth MKM, told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” last week. Irwin had just increased his price target to $380 from $85, writing in a report that “Musk’s authentic support for Trump likely doubled Tesla’s pool of enthusiasts and lifted credibility for a demand inflection.”

On Wednesday, analysts at Goldman Sachs boosted their price target on Tesla, joining a parade of firms that have lifted their price expectation or their rating on the stock. The Goldman analysts wrote that “the market is taking a more forward-looking approach to Tesla, including with respect to its AI opportunity.”

Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have also issued bullish reports of late.

Since Trump’s victory, Musk has been accompanying the president-elect in meetings with world leaders, and began advising him and members of Congress as to which federal agencies, regulations and budget items the billionaire would like to eliminate or greatly reduce.

Tesla’s surge to a record marks a dramatic turn from its performance to start the year. The company’s shares plunged 29% in the first three months of 2024, the worst quarter for the stock since the end of 2022 and the third worst since Tesla went public in 2010. At the time, investors were concerned about Tesla’s core business, which reported declining revenue in the first quarter in part due to increased competition from China.

In its third-quarter earnings report in October, Tesla reported a year-over-year revenue increase of 8%, which fell just shy of estimates. However, the company reported better-than-expected profit, and Musk said on the earnings call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, due to “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” That forecast was ahead of analysts’ predictions.

2024-12-11,04:41:10,stocks,Trump names Andrew Ferguson as head of Federal Trade Commission to replace Lina Khan,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/10/trump-names-andrew-ferguson-as-head-of-federal-trade-commission-to-replace-lina-khan.html

> President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday named Andrew Ferguson as the next chair of the Federal Trade Commission. He will replace Lina Khan, who became a lightning rod for Wall Street and Silicon Valley by blocking billions of dollars’ worth of corporate acquisitions and suing Amazon and Meta while alleging anticompetitive behavior. Ferguson is already one of the FTC’s five commissioners, which is currently made up of three Democrats and two Republicans. “Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding, “Andrew will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country’s History.”

> The replacement of Khan likely means that the FTC will operate with a lighter touch when it comes to antitrust enforcement. The new chair is expected to appoint new directors of the FTC’s antitrust and consumer protection divisions. “These changes likely will make the FTC more favorable to business than it has been in recent years, though the extent to which is to be determined,” wrote Anthony DiResta, a consumer protection attorney at Holland & Knight, in a recent analysis.

> Deals that were blocked by the Biden administration could find new life with Trump in command. For example, the new leadership could be more open to a proposed merger between the country’s two biggest supermarket chains, Kroger and Albertsons, which forged a $24.6 billion deal to combine in 2022. Two judges halted the merger Tuesday night.

2024-12-11,00:07:41,stocks,Siemens - worth a look? A balanced view.,"Purpose of this post is to get a sense of 'sentiment' about Siemens. It's not a lazy $hit post, asking ""what do y'all think yo""? But yeah, essentially, that's what I am asking, besides listing down a long list of pros and cons of the company.

I've no position yet (long or short), but thinking of it.

Pros:

1. The conglomerate needs no introduction. There's virtually NO piece of any complex, industrial machinery (boats, planes, turbines, large diesel engines, data center infrastructure, heating, cooling, all kinds of factories, power plant, high voltage transformer...) that doesn't have at least a few critical components made by Siemens. The company stands to benefit from **energy transition, mobility, urbanization** (smart cities), and is focused on **high-margin** specialized components.
2. Valuations: 18 PE, 1.9 PS [Siemens AG - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SIE:ETR?window=YTD)
3. News: there's plenty of positive news and developments [Google News ](https://news.google.com/search?for=siemens&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en) Most notably, partnership with NVDA for industrial robotics applications. Won a few contracts in the middle East. 
4. Gaining momentum: for last 10 days at least, the trading volume is virtually all **BUY volume**. BUY volume means the trades were executed at 'ask' price. Buyers had to up their bids to get hands on the stock.
5. Low retail concentration: only 19% retail shareholders. Less susceptible to 'crowd' thinking. It's not your GME or TSLA which will up/down 10% in a day. Movements will be very slow and steady. In other words, low volatality. It's a steady wealth builder with 14% YTD; don't expect 500% in 5 years.

Cons:

1. German company. Yes, yes, we know Germany is in recession, aging population, generally hard business climate.. etc etc. But the company's operations are global. The only geographical 'risk' is, you've a stock in EUR currency, not traded as ADR on US exchange (as far as I know). Revenues come from all over the world, in many currencies.
2. Lot of competition: ABB, GE, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Larsen & Toubro.. may not be retail, well known names, but they all do the same stuff, some better; some worse. It's all about winning a large government / private contracts.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-12-10,22:25:41,stocks,Oracle shares head for worst day of 2024 after earnings miss,"Oracle shares dropped 8% on Tuesday and headed for their steepest decline in a year following the database software vendor’s disappointing earnings report.

The stock’s worst day of the year had been a 5.4% decline in May. The shares are still up about 68% in 2024, which would be the best annual performance since the dot-com boom of 1999.

After the close Monday, Oracle reported adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of $1.47, trailing analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to LSEG. Revenue rose 9% from a year earlier to $14.06 billion, missing the $14.1 billion average estimate.

Net income increased 26% to $3.15 billion, or $1.10 a share, from $2.5 billion, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in Oracle’s cloud services business jumped 12% from a year earlier to $10.81 billion, accounting for 77% of total revenue.

“A bit of a stumble here for a stock that’s created some lofty expectations for itself,” wrote analysts at KeyBank Capital Markets in a note after the report on Monday. They still recommend buying the stock and said “we still like oracle heading into 2025.”

For the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue growth of 7% to 9%. At the midpoint of that range, revenue would be about $14.3 billion. Analysts were expecting sales of $14.65 billion, according to LSEG. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $1.50 to $1.54 per share. Analysts were calling for earnings per share of $1.57.

Oracle’s biggest growth engine has been cloud infrastructure, where it is competing with Amazon, Microsoft and Google as businesses move workloads out of their own data centers.  
  
The business is booming due to soaring demand for computing power that can handle artificial intelligence projects. Oracle said revenue in its cloud infrastructure unit surged 52% from a year earlier to $2.4 billion.  
  
Oracle said it just signed an agreement with Meta, allowing the social media company to use its infrastructure to help with various projects related to the Llama family of large language models.

“Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world’s most important generative AI models because we are faster and less expensive than other clouds,” Oracle founder Larry Ellison said in a statement.

Analysts at Piper Sandler raised their price target on the stock to $210 from $185 “based on continued cloud momentum.” They cited Oracle’s cRPO (current remaining performance obligations) growth of 20%. That figures points to contracted revenue that has yet to be booked.

2024-12-10,22:23:07,stocks,GM halts funding of robotaxi development by Cruise,"General Motors said Tuesday that it will no longer fund robotaxi development work by Cruise citing “capital allocation priorities,” and “the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.”

The Detroit automaker plans to “realign its autonomous driving strategy” to focus on advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous systems for use in personal vehicles instead, and it will combine the majority-owned Cruise LLC and GM technical teams.

This summer, the Detroit automaker said it would indefinitely delay production of the Origin autonomous vehicle as its Cruise self-driving unit attempted to relaunch operations. At that point, Cruise began to focus on using the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt for development of autonomous vehicles since then.

In the U.S. Alphabet-owned Waymo has begun to operate commercial robotaxi services across several major metro areas while GM-owned Cruise has faltered. Chinese autonomous vehicle makers including Pony.ai and WeRide have rolled out in overseas markets as well.

Tesla, meanwhile, showed off design concepts for a self-driving Cybercab at an event in October. Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software in its vehicles as “partially automated driving systems,” which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025.

SoftBank-funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, and Amazon-owned Zoox is also testing its autonomous vehicles, which do not feature steering wheels, in several U.S. cities including San Francisco.

2024-12-10,15:42:37,stocks,Google shares rise on new quantum chip breakthrough,"

Shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw a 4% increase in pre-open trading Tuesday, reflecting investor confidence following the company's unveiling of its new quantum computing chip, Willow. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, introduced the chip on Monday, highlighting its ability to significantly reduce computational errors and its performance in benchmark tests.

Pichai emphasized the chip's potential in practical applications, stating, ""We see Willow as an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications in areas like drug discovery, fusion energy, battery design + more.""

The new chip, according to Pichai, has achieved two major milestones. It can exponentially decrease errors with the addition of more qubits, addressing a quantum error correction challenge that has persisted for nearly three decades. In addition, Willow completed a standard benchmark computation in less than five minutes, a task that would take one of the fastest supercomputers today more than 10 septillion years.
This development is part of Google's long-term commitment to quantum computing, a vision that began over a decade ago when Pichai founded Google Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) AI in 2012. 

The goal is to build a quantum computer that leverages quantum mechanics to advance scientific discovery and address societal challenges.

The announcement drew a simple yet telling reaction from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who expressed his astonishment with a single word, ""wow,"" on social media platform X.

The Willow chip represents a significant advancement for Google Quantum AI and positions the company closer to achieving commercially viable quantum computing applications.",TSLA,Tesla

2024-12-10,08:46:46,stocks,Uber vs Everyone,"Alright unless you been living under a rock you heard or seen some videos of self driving vehicles be it waymo or tesla. The future of self driving vehicles is not a question of if at this point but when .
My question to you is this - how do you see uber play out in this changing fat environment. In your view do you see uber benefiting or losing from the rise of AV brought in by smaller and bigger companies.

Here is my take and I’m also not fully clear (I think the CEO needs to come out and clarify clearly their path and their different partnership goals).

Uber clearly wants to be a software company, the biggest aggregator of all mobility needs. They spent like crazy to be number 1 in travel. They spent like crazy during Covid to be the number 1 food delivery service. They spending like crazy on grocery delivery from what I notice and they eye to grow their freight business.

All their investments and actions points towards the aggregator strategy , from offloading their own self driving decision to Aurora to investing in all kinds of different startup from Serv robotics to Aurora (25% ownership) and companies in India, Asia and Latin America.

Can this strategy back fire? It could, however let’s ask , what does Google want? Google up until this point was mainly a software company, yes they produce their own pixel phones but I believe their main competitor is not Uber but Tesla. Google might be expanding their taxi service but is the end goal for them to be a global taxi company? I think not. There is much more profit in expanding the waymo service up until they prove that their software reached maturity. At that point Google will lease that software to any car manufacturer for a price, growing revenue in speeds that they won’t be able to match staying exclusive, hence the Tesla competitor. In the scenario that they lease/sell their software to any car manufacturer, it won’t be the end of the road for Uber because at worst case they can purchase a fleet of cars to continue their operations and supplement their other AV partners.

Now let’s assume waymo stays exclusive and Google interested to be a taxi company, meaning their partnership with Uber will end and they essentially going to compete with Uber. In this case, uber investments in Aurora Innovation might come helpful, they can re-acquire Aurora and their tech for whatever it’s worth and build on top of it. They can use their large cash flow to acquire a smaller AV company that struggles to compete with the big players and build on it. In both scenarios uber has a way out, as long as they don’t lay on their stomach blinded by short term profits (think BlackBerry in early 2000) and make sure to pivot at the right moment (if aggregator role dont workout, time to go shopping for small AV).

This is how I see it, I will be happy for anyone to challenge this view because sometime we all get blinded by our own biases.

Further Tesla is becoming less of an exclusive brand and revenue (which hasn't seen real growth the last quarters) is mainly from more discounted cars. Of course Tesla is more than just the cars, but it is their core business..

2024-12-05,17:06:20,stocks,"Waymo to expand to Miami, aims to launch robotaxi service there in 2026","Waymo is setting its sights on its next location: the Sunshine State.

The Alphabet-owned company announced Thursday that it will be hitting the roads in Miami. Waymo said it will first begin cruising through the Florida city with human safety drivers in 2025 before opening doors to riders for its robotaxi service through its Waymo One app in 2026.

The expansion into Miami is indicative of Waymo’s growing confidence in operating its self-driving vehicles in harsher weather conditions in large metropolitan areas in the U.S.

Waymo first tested in Miami in 2019, which the company said helped improve the ability of its self-driving vehicles to navigate in wet and rainy conditions.

“We deepened our learning and understanding of the Waymo Driver’s performance in adverse weather conditions,” a company spokesperson said.

Waymo will use what it learned when it returns to the city with its all-electric Jaguar I-PACEs next year.

The company said its initial territory in Florida will include some parts of Miami’s larger metropolitan area, which has a population of more than 6 million people.

Waymo has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

In November, the company announced it was removing its waitlist of about 300,000 people in Los Angeles, so anyone would be able to use Waymo One to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout the nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County. The company’s ride-hailing service also operates citywide in Phoenix and San Francisco.

And in September, Waymo announced a partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta. Through that deal, Uber riders will be able to access Waymo’s robotaxis through the Uber app starting in early 2025, and Uber will be responsible for fleet management and operations of the Waymo vehicles, including maintenance and infrastructure, such as vehicle charging, cleaning and repairs. 

Additionally, Waymo on Thursday announced that it will partner with mobility company Moove to manage its fleet operations, facilities and charging infrastructure in both Miami and Phoenix. Moove will begin managing Waymo’s Phoenix fleet in early 2025, a Waymo spokesperson said. 

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture’s parent company, Alphabet, which also owns Google, led the funding round alongside earlier backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company said it now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week via the Waymo One app across San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles. 

Waymo is the only autonomous vehicle developer that currently operates a commercial robotaxi service in several major metro areas across the U.S., but competitors are looming. 

GM-owned Cruise is working on bringing its autonomous vehicles back into use on public roads after discontinuing its services following an accident where one of its self-driving cars injured a pedestrian in San Francisco. 

Tesla, meanwhile, showed off design concepts for a self-driving Cybercab and Robovan at an event in October. However, Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software in its vehicles as “partially automated driving systems,” which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025.

SoftBank-funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, and Amazon-owned Zoox is also testing its self-driving cars, which do not feature steering wheels, in several U.S. cities.

I currently hold 300 shares of META that I purchased back in March and have seen decent gains. I want to protect these profits without triggering taxes from selling before the one-year mark (to qualify for long-term capital gains).

I’m considering selling deep in-the-money (ITM) calls with March expiration. These options would expire shortly after my one-year holding period, so my shares would be eligible for long-term capital gains if exercised after expiration.

I understand that selling deep ITM calls could constrain my margin account while the options are open. Aside from that, are there any other risks or pitfalls I should be aware of with this strategy? For example:
	•	Could this strategy be flagged as a “constructive sale” by the IRS?

META, the parent company of Facebook, is spending $10 billion to build its largest data center ever in Louisiana, the company confirmed on Wednesday.

The data center will take up 4 million square feet of an industrial site in the northern half of the state that once held a headlight factory.

The center will be powered by three new natural gas plants with 2.2 gigawatts of combined capacity, according to Entergy, the utility working with the tech giant. That is enough to power more than one million homes. Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman, said the plants will also provide power to the surrounding community.

“Entergy raised its earnings growth outlook substantially (solely because of this 1 new customer) and the stock rose 15% on that day,” wrote Rodney Rebello, an analyst covering power stocks at Reaves Asset Management, in an email to *Barron’s*. “It’s a monumental deal for the sector.”

Meta spokeswoman Stacey Yip told *Barron’s* the Louisiana data center “will be significantly larger than our other data center campuses.”

The company didn’t say how many GPUs the new facility will be able to support. Yip said estimating the future number of GPUs is becoming complex as GPU technology becomes more efficient.

Yip also said Meta will invest in 1.5 gigawatts worth of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to reduce its carbon footprint. All told, Meta will help finance “enough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,” she wrote in an email.

But it isn’t clear when those renewable projects will start. Entergy has filed for permission with the state utilities commission to build the natural gas plants, but not the renewable ones yet, Kirby said.

Meta also said on Tuesday that it is exploring using nuclear energy to power data centers, and asked companies in that field to submit proposals for nuclear reactors. Any reactors wouldn’t be available until well into the 2030s, however.

Meta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence and has been expanding the number of data centers it uses to process its AI applications. But even as the AI race accelerates, this Louisiana data center doesn’t look like it will be completed soon. The company said construction will “continue through 2030 with site work beginning in December.”

Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company's driving force who is responsible for many of its advances, and reinstate his compensation.McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case $345 million, well short of the billions they initially requested.

Reddit, the American online discussion platform, has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK, according to the communications watchdog.

Ofcom said Reddit, where users post on discussion threads within topic-based communities, was visited by 22.9 million UK adults in May this year, compared with 22.1 million on X.

The figures make Reddit the fastest-growing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47% on the same period in 2023. The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook [Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook), reaching more than 44 million adults.

Reddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google’s search engine this year.

Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: “Google’s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.”

Ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused [by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/reddit-moderators-vow-to-continue-blackout-in-api-access-fees-row), forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit’s stock market flotation in March this year.

The popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its [takeover by Elon Musk in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal) but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X [launched by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/06/meta-launches-twitter-rival-threads-in-100-countries).

The Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog’s annual report into the nation’s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online.

The misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is “significant evidence” of electoral fraud in the UK.

The regulator also found that one-third of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2024-11-28,02:38:14,stocks,Microsoft faces wide-ranging U.S. antitrust probe,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.  
  
The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.  
  
The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.

Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday.  
  
The FTC fielded complaints about Microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market.

NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft’s licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.

“Given that Microsoft is the world’s largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,” the group said.  
The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.  
  
Until now, Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators’ recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.  
  
Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.  
  
Alphabet’s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google’s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.  
  
Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.  
  
In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

2024-11-27,11:20:49,stocks,Deep dive into Kering - From Timber to Gucci: A Legacy of Acquisitions,"**1.0 Introduction**

Let’s start with a fun fact. Kering, the company that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, started as a **timber-trading company**.

Although it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry, its DNA and management style haven’t changed much.

As I’m writing this, its share price is **down over 70%** from its peak back in August 2021 that was elevated due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

  
**2.0 The journey from timber to luxury**

***2.1 The timber period (1962 - 1988)***

The company was founded in France by François Pinault back in 1962 with a 100,000 francs loan from the bank. The business grew rapidly by **acquiring** many failing local timber traders in France, especially in the 1980s. By 1988, it owned 180 companies and 33 factories.

***2.2 The switch from timber to retail to luxury (1988 - 2013 - present)***

In 1988, it was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started:

* It merged with CFAO (A French distribution conglomerate)
* Acquired Conforama (French furniture retailer)
* Acquired Printemps (Department stores)
* Acquired 54% of La Redoute (French mail-order shopping retailer)
* Acquired Finac (French bookstore, multimedia, and electronics retailer)

The transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42% of **Gucci Group,** 100% of **Boucheron,** and 100% of **Yves Saint Laurent.** Today, Gucci accounts for 47% of its revenue.

François-Henri Pinault, the son of the founder François Pinault, became general manager of the company in 2003, and CEO in 2005. Under his leadership, the acquisitions in the luxury space continued.

It is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions (Conforama, Le Printemps, CFAO, and Fnac).

Its portfolio is quite diversified and includes:

* High-end clothing
* Footwear
* Handbags and leather goods
* Sunglasses and eyewear
* Scarves & other fashion accessories
* Jewelry
* Fragrances (due to the Creed acquisition)
* Cosmetics (in early stage)
* Watches

It is also geographically diversified:

* **APAC (excl. Japan)**: 32% of revenue
* **Western Europe**: 28% of revenue
* **North America**: 23% of revenue
* **Japan**: 8% of revenue
* **Rest of the World**: 9% of revenue

**3.0 Historical financial performance**

Its revenue increased from €15.9 billion in 2019, to €20.4 billion in 2022, and has contracted back to €18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. 

Kering’s gross margin is stable at \~75%, meaning the direct costs are well controlled.

However, its operating margin is down below 20% (vs. 29% back in 2019). The explanation is simple.

**Reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job.**

When there’s less traffic (and subsequently less sales) in the physical stores, the operating expenses remain the same. The company still needs to pay the lease payment, its employees, the utility bills, etc. In fact, these expenses grow over time as there’s the impact of inflation.

Scaling down, by closing locations is also not a free option. Not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier, but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location.

The company is generating substantial cash flows, but I’ll argue the capital allocation is poor.

||all numbers in €m|
|:-|:-|
|Cash (January 2019)|€1.837|
|Operating cash flow|€21.541|
|Capex|(€7.772)|
|Acquisitions|(€6.559)|
|Debt|€4.887|
|Share buyback|(€2.034)|
|Dividends|(€8.229)|
|Other|€25|
|Cash (June 2024)|€3.696|

Between 2019 and H1-2024, the company generated **over €21.5 billion** in operating cash flow, or **a bit less than €14 billion after capex.**

Close to 60% of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends, and an additional 15% through share buybacks. What’s left of the free cash flow, together with additional debt, was used for acquisitions.

Why do I think the capital allocation is poor? Two main reasons:

1. Almost 80% of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022, the years when the share price was the highest (and temporarily elevated). A good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares.
2. Its net debt position more than doubled, from **€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024. This is equal to \~60% of its market cap. The interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75% to 5% and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate, it could significantly reduce its profit margins.



**4.0 What can be expected?**

Based on the latest investor presentation, there are three capital allocation priorities:

* Organic growth;
* Shareholder return; and
* Fuel high-potential adjacent businesses.

All of it, while having a **healthy financial situation and FCF generation.**

This is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. I find this slide a bit odd for three reasons:

1. On one side they want to return capital to the shareholders, which would position them as a company **with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends**. On the other side, its history is full of **acquisitions, which is the opposite of preserving capital.**
2. The center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and FCF generation, while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years (**€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024).
3. Innovation is not a focus at all. Roughly 2 months ago, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. I see a lot of potential in this area that isn’t utilized (yet).

**Growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the DNA of the company and likely what one should expect going forward.**

  
**5.0 Dividends**

The dividend per share has been steadily increasing from €4 back in 2015, to €14 in 2024. The current dividend yield is \~6%.

If the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends (instead of borrowing to acquire more companies), Kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option.

  
**6.0 High employee turnover**

At the end of 2023, the company had 48,964 employees. During the year, there were **13,403** new hires, and **11,275** employees departed. At first glance, this is no doubt a high turnover.

This sounds bad at first, but it is really difficult to decipher.

In theory, any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees (temporarily) during peak seasons. Therefore the increase, and subsequently decrease, of employees is normal. This is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive (such as sales and manufacturing).

In addition, 59% of the employees are Gen Y (1981-1995), a generation that is known for seeking career growth, which could lead to more job-hopping than average.

Given the reviews on Indeed, Glassdoor, and Comparably, there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue.

  
**7.0 The concerns**

**7.1 Balenciaga Advertising Scandal (2022)**

Back in 2022, Balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. One of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage-inspired outfits. This was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate.

This brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing.

In addition, given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands (Gucci - 46%, YSL - 17%, Bottega Veneta - 9%), scandals of this kind could have a significant impact.

**7.2 Preliminary investigation by the European Commission (2023)**

In April 2023, the European Commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. One of the inspections took place at the Italian premises of Gucci.

An investigation of this kind does not imply guilt, but if a company is found in breach of EU antitrust rules, there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros.

The investigation is still ongoing, and no conclusions have been reached.

  
**8.0 Valuation** 

This is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. Therefore, here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing Kering:

* **Revenue** \- The industry is cyclical in nature, so there will be good and bad times. Based on the past, I do not feel confident that Kering can take market share, so I expect its growth to normalize at \~3% per year, which is in line with the inflation rate.
* **Operating margin** \- The luxury market is getting more crowded, and as argued earlier, reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. Once the demand is somewhat stable, I expect the operating margin to increase to 21%.

Based on those assumptions (and a discount rate of \~9%), the fair value of the company is **€27 billion (€220/share)** which is very close to the current price of **€224/share**.

This offers an IRR of \~9%, which is slightly below the historical return of the S&P500.

  
**8.1 The Bull Case**

Those who are betting on Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following:

* Revitalization of Balenciaga & rebuilding its reputation after the controversies;
* Sustained growth in Gucci, and expansion of secondary brands like Bottega Veneta & Saint Laurent;
* The success of its newly launched beauty division, capturing market share from rivals like LVMH and Estee Lauder;
* Positive macro tailwinds;

* Utilizing pricing power;
* Integration of recent acquisitions;
* Reducing operating costs;

**If the management can pull this off, then the value per share could be 2x from today’s share price.**



**8.2 The Bear Case**

Those who are betting against Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following:

* Brand mismanagement & more scandals;
* Inability to revitalize Balenciaga;
* Inability to innovate around its primary brands;
* Failure to integrate its acquisitions & further poor M&A acquisitions;
* Negative macro tailwinds;
* Inability to innovate around E-Commerce;
* Supply chain issues;
* Competitive pressure;
* Increase in corporate tax by the French authorities

**In this scenario, the fair value per share could be below €100/share.**

2024-11-26,10:33:15,stocks,Rivian Receives Conditional Commitment for up to $6.6 Billion Loan from the U.S. Department of Energy,"RVINE, Calif., November 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American all-electric automaker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced it has received conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion (including $6 billion of principal and approximately $600 million of capitalized interest) to accelerate its growth and leadership of electric vehicle design, development and manufacturing in the United States.

If finalized, the loan would support the construction of Rivian’s next facility in Stanton Springs North, near the city of Social Circle, Georgia, substantially expanding the company’s domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets. This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company’s midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company’s long-term growth and profitability.

The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.

Rivian intends to build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity–supporting the sale of American EVs in international markets. Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. Rivian is expected to create approximately 7,500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company’s future manufacturing facility in Georgia. This is in addition to 2,000 expected full-time construction jobs that will utilize the region’s significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem. These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal, Illinois, which have bolstered the local and regional economy.

""This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in EV manufacturing and technology,"" said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. ""This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability. A robust ecosystem of U.S. companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the U.S. to maintain its long-term leadership in transportation.""

Rivian plans to design and build a fully modern manufacturing facility at the Stanton Springs Site, less than one hour’s drive from downtown Atlanta, employing modern construction techniques and advanced environmental management while preserving natural spaces and investing actively in the surrounding communities.

Over the history of the loan program, DOE has helped energize American EV manufacturing with billions in financing for this strategically important industry, including loans to General Motors and Tesla.

While this conditional commitment indicates DOE’s intent to finance the project, DOE and the company must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the Department of Energy enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan. If finalized, the loan would be secured by all assets of the project and fixed assets and guarantees of the parent company, Rivian Automotive, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.

2024-11-26,00:20:54,stocks,"California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits, governor's office says","Tesla's electric vehicles likely would not qualify for California's new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if President-elect Donald Trump scraps the federal tax credit for EV purchases, Governor Gavin Newsom's office said on Monday.
Tesla shares closed down 4%.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

2024-11-22,14:40:58,stocks,Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio,"Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative 



So having said all that, what is everyone’s thoughts on this proposed portfolio allocation. Is this too risky, not enough diversification into the different sectors? Any thoughts and opinions on this would be great!",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2024-11-19,23:08:46,stocks,"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

2024-11-19,21:04:07,stocks,"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  
*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

Happy investing!",TSLA,Tesla

TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

  
(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.

If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect’s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.

One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said. 

Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.

The transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk’s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment. 

He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, saying he’d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.

Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.

Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.

NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.

A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",TSLA,Tesla

AMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

AMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

AMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.

GPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

AMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.

2024-11-07,22:22:59,stocks,Pinterest stock plunges following weak Q4 revenue guidance,"Pinterest shares plunged 15% Thursday after the social media company provided soft guidance for its fourth-quarter revenue despite it beating the top and bottom lines with its third-quarter earnings.

Here’s how the company performed, according to LSEG:

* **Revenue**: $898 million vs. $896 million expected
* **Earnings per share:** 40 cents adjusted vs. 34 cents expected

The company said that fourth-quarter revenue will be between the range of $1.125 million to $1.145 million. The midpoint of the fourth-quarter guidance, $1.135 million, trailed analyst estimates of $1.143 million.

Sales in Pinterest’s third-quarter rose 18% from $763.2 million a year ago.

Pinterest said it had 537 million global monthly active users in the third quarter, topping analyst estimates of 532.6 million.  

The company’s net income grew a whopping 354% year over year to $30.56 million. Its total cost and expenses for the quarter were $904 million, up 17% compared with $768 million the previous year.

Pinterest’s latest quarterly earnings follows the recent U.S. presidential election earlier in the week in addition to multiple earnings reports from other tech companies with online advertising businesses.

Last week, Amazon said its ads business grew 19% year over year to $14.3 billion in the third quarter, and Meta said its third-quarter sales rose 19% year over year to $40.59 billion. However, Meta shares dropped slightly on weaker-than-expected user numbers and warned of a significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses in 2025.

Alphabet said during its third-quarter earnings last week that advertising sales in the period grew 10% year over year to $65.85 billion while its YouTube video unit reported ad revenue of $8.92 billion, up 12% from the previous year.

Microsoft said last week that its search and news advertising revenue jumped 18% year over year as part of its latest earnings report, but the company does not reveal that unit’s specific quarterly sales numbers.

Reddit and Snap also reported their most recent quarterly earnings last week. Reddit said that sales in its third quarter soared 68% to $348.4 million from the prior year while Snap’s third-quarter revenue grew 15% year over year to $1.37 billion.

2024-11-07,00:27:53,stocks,Qualcomm pops on chipmaker's earnings and revenue beat,"Qualcomm reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, and the company guided to a strong December quarter.

The shares rose 10% in extended trading at one point before falling to a gain of about 4%.

Here’s how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ending Sept. 29:

Earnings per share: $2.69, adjusted $2.56 expected

Revenue: $10.24 billion versus $9.90 billion expected

Qualcomm said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, with the midpoint of that range beating LSEG consensus expectations of $10.59 billion.

The company reported $2.92 billion in net income, or $2.59 per share, a sharp jump from last year’s $1.49 billion, or $1.23 per share. Qualcomm reported $33.19 billion in total revenue in its fiscal 2024, a 9% increase from 2023.

Qualcomm’s fortunes have historically been tied to the smartphone industry, where the company provides a range of chips to handset makers, including system-on-a-chip processors, modems, and antennas. The company makes the chip at the heart of most high-end Android devices, and many lower-end phones as well. Qualcomm also sells modems and related chips to Apple for its iPhones, and last year said its contract for 5G chips ran through 2026.

Qualcomm reported a 12% increase in handset chip sales to $6.1 billion, in line with FactSet estimates. Qualcomm introduced its high-end chip for 2025, called Snapdragon 8 Elite, in October.

“In handsets we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues,” said Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala on a call with analysts.

Under CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has diversified away from being a smartphone supplier and has introduced and invested heavily in producing chips for PCs, cars, and industrial machines.

“We will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on the earnings call with analysts.

Qualcomm has also made efforts to brand itself as a leader in AI, having developed smartphone chips with specialized parts for machine learning since 2017. But unlike Nvidia, the company doesn’t produce the kind of graphics processors for data centers that are used for big AI programs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The automotive business grew 86% on an annual basis to $899 million in sales. Qualcomm says it has billions of dollars in business with automakers currently in its development pipeline, and highlighted it was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Qualcomm said that it expected automotive sales in the current quarter to rise 50% on an annual basis.

The company’s “internet of things” business includes both chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Meta uses in its Quest handsets and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. It also includes the new business selling chips for laptops running Microsoft Windows. The division reported $1.68 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from a year earlier.

Qualcomm’s chip business, including its handset, automotive, and other chips, which together is reported as QCT, saw sales rise 18% during the quarter to $7.37 billion in total. 

The company’s profitable technology licensing business, QTL, reported $1.52 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the same period last year.

Qualcomm said its board had approved $15 billion in additional buybacks. During the fourth quarter, it repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares and paid out $947 million in dividends.

**Musk now says it's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers**

&#x200B;

*When Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-promised, next-generation $25,000 electric vehicle, the automaker’s stock plunged. Chief Executive Elon Musk rushed to respond on X, his social-media network.*  
*“Reuters is lying,” he posted, without elaborating. Tesla’s stock recovered some of its losses.*  
*Six months later, Musk appears to have backed into an admission that Tesla dropped its plans for a human-driven $25,000 car. He said in an Oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable EV would be ""pointless” unless the car was fully autonomous.*  
*His latest remarks came in response to an investor asking: “When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model?”*  
*Musk responded: “We’re not making a non-robo…,” before he was interrupted by another Tesla executive. Musk later added: “Basically, I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly.”*  
*The April 5 Reuters article reported that Tesla had abandoned plans for an all-new, affordable mass-market EV but still planned a self-driving robotaxi. Since then, Musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles.*  
*Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story.*  
*On the October earnings call, Musk said that Tesla does plan a “$25K car” – its “Cybercab,” a two-door, two-seat, fully autonomous vehicle. Musk unveiled a prototype at a Hollywood-style event on Oct. 10.*  
*Musk says Tesla will start production of the Cybercab in 2026, after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California next year. The automaker faces steep technological, regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on Musk’s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles, which echo others dating back about a decade.*  
*An all-new affordable Tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of Tesla’s strategy to become the world’s biggest automaker. For several years, Tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030, more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of Toyota, the current global sales leader. In May, Tesla dropped the 20-million goal from its latest “impact report” on progress toward sustainability goals.*  
*As recently as January of this year, Musk confirmed the plan for an all-new affordable EV in an earnings call. He said the next-generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major ""growth wave,” following the first wave with the release of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in 2017 and 2020, respectively.*  
*Investors and Tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a “Model 2,” slotting in below the Model 3, currently the least-expensive Tesla, starting at $42,490.*  
*In January, Musk described the all-new model as requiring “new revolutionary manufacturing technology.” But in April, after Reuters reported Tesla had scrapped the Model 2, Musk outlined a plan for “more affordable” models that could be produced “on the same manufacturing lines” as current Teslas.*  
*Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar Research Services analyst, said he believes these less-expensive vehicles will be built on current Tesla platforms and priced in the mid-$30,000s.*  
*“It was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more-affordable vehicle on a new platform,” he told Reuters. “I think Tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their Chinese-EV peers … So, they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle.”*  
*After the April 5 Reuters report that Tesla had killed the Model 2, Musk posted that day on X saying Tesla planned a “robotaxi unveil” in August. The event, delayed until October and held on a movie set near Los Angeles, underwhelmed Wall Street and drove a 9% drop in Tesla shares the following day.*  
*Some investors viewed Musk’s comments on the Cybercab – along with displays of an autonomous “Robovan” concept and humanoid robots – as short on concrete details about the products. Tesla hasn’t said whether the Cybercab will feature new self-driving technology beyond the company’s “Full Self-Driving” feature in its current vehicles. Its existing models can’t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention.*  
*The target market for the Cybercab isn’t clear. The Cybercab’s sports-car looks and two-door, two-seat configuration – a nearly extinct layout in the wider U.S. auto market – puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage.*  
*Musk, in the October earnings call, said the concept vehicle’s design was “optimized for autonomy” and would also deliver affordability.*  
*“It will cost … roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car,” Musk said. “It just won't have a steering wheel and pedals.”*",TSLA,Tesla

2024-11-01,01:44:41,stocks,Amazon CEO pledges AI investments will pay off as capital expenditures surge 81%,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is trying to reassure investors who may be worried about the future payoff of the company’s massive investments in generative artificial intelligence.

On a conference call with analysts following the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Thursday, Jassy pointed to the success of Amazon’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, which has become a crucial profit engine despite the extreme costs associated with building data centers.

“I think we’ve proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business,” Jassy said. “We expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI.”

Amazon spent $22.6 billion on property and equipment during the quarter, up 81% from the year before. Jassy said Amazon plans to spend $75 billion on capex in 2024 and expects an even higher number in 2025.

The jump in spending is primarily being driven by generative AI investments, Jassy said. The company is rushing to invest in data centers, networking gear and hardware to meet vast demand for the technology, which has exploded in popularity since OpenAI released its ChatGPT assistant almost two years ago.

“It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,” Jassy said. “And I think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long term that we’re aggressively pursuing it.”

AI spending was a big topic on tech earnings calls this week. Meta on Wednesday raised its capital expenditures guidance, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was “quite happy” with the team’s execution. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI weighed on its fiscal first-quarter earnings released on Wednesday, and the company said capital spending would continue to rise. A day earlier, Alphabet CFO Anat Ashkenazi warned the company expects capital spending to grow in 2025.

Amazon has said its cloud unit has picked up more business from companies that need infrastructure to deploy generative AI models. It’s also launched several AI products for enterprises, third-party sellers on its marketplace and advertisers in recent months. The company is expected to announce a souped-up version of its Alexa voice assistant that incorporates generative AI, something Jassy said will arrive “in the near future.”

Amazon hasn’t disclosed its revenue from generative AI, but Jassy said Thursday it’s become a “multi-billion-dollar revenue run rate” business within AWS that “continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage.”

“It’s growing more than three times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly,” he added.

**Why the rout?** Analysts and investors panned high Capex plans of $40Bn and costly high-risk bets such as Meta’s Reality Labs unit, (the developer of augmented and virtual reality technologies), which logged a staggering operating loss of $4.4 billion 

Microsoft - (down 6% to $408) is getting clobbered for a different reason. Even as Azure grew 34%, the pace wasn’t enough, and guidance of 31% to 32% in constant currency was lower than expected. However, this is due to supply chain constraints as President Amy Hood noted that the 1 or 2-point deceleration Microsoft has guided is mainly due to some supply pushouts, in terms of AI supply coming online that the company counted on. (Read, not as many Blackwells/Hoppers as they would have liked)

""We expect consumption growth to be stable compared to Q1, and we expect to add more sequential dollars to Azure than any other quarter in history,"" Hood added.

The indomitable Dan Ives of Wedbush remains as bullish as ever…

""We actually disagree with this initial take as the new Azure reporting standards have moved Street numbers all around and a slight deceleration is totally expected by many investors with some supply constraints and reacceleration in 2H25, and we would be strong buyers of MSFT on any weakness this morning,"" Wedbush analysts, led by Daniel Ives, said in a note.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

2024-10-31,14:26:37,stocks,$UBER is positioned extremely well for the future,"At the time of writing this post, UBER is down 7% in premarket, which is a big overreaction, after their earnings report. I suspect the cause of the drop is the miss on Bookings, which is not significant in my opinion.

Key factors:

- EPS of $1.20, beating expectations of $0.41

- Revenue of $11.2B, beating expectations of $11B

- Total Gross Bookings of $41B, missing expectations of $43B

UBER had a record quarter, for the first time it generated an all time high GAAP operating profits of more than $1B.

In the conference call the CEO and CFO reiterated that they have a very high standard for doing M&A, so the Expedia deal is not set in stone, rather just a rumor.

They've also stated they are looking to reduce share count in 2025, meaning doing share buybacks, which will in turn drive higher share price.

But what I want to talk mostly about is the AV section.

**AV**

The AV (Autonomous vehicle or self driving cars) is a hot topic right now, especially after Teslas event. Despite Tesla being clearly very far behind actual FSD, Waymo is doing AV, and doing it good. They are partenered with UBER and the AV fleet actually had the highest rated score on the platform (as mentioned by their CEO in the earnings call). Beside Waymo, they are partenered with 14 AV companies, including Aurora which they also have a big stake in. AV is coming, maybe not now, maybe not next year, but it is inevitably coming. And all these AV, especially the smaller ones, need a platform to operate their fleet. Do you build it from the ground up or join UBER who has 25 million rides a day already?

They are also partnered with BYD for the electrification of their fleet. Guess what is BYD also working on? Yeah, thats right, AVs. And judging BYD/China success on doing EVs, I think thats a pretty good chance they will also succeed on the AV side. And since they are already partenered, where do you think BYDs AV fleet will be used? In UBER.

I think the company is positioned greatly for the future, its profitable after multiple years of negative EPS, it has a clear plan moving forward about their free cash flow, including reducing $2B out of their debt by the end of the year. 

Disclaimer, I do have a position in UBER.",TSLA,Tesla

Snap said its adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be between $210 million and $260 million. The middle of the range is higher than analysts’ estimates of $230.7 million.

The company’s sales jumped 15% year over year in the third quarter while its net loss narrowed by 58% year over year in the third quarter to $153 million, compared to a net loss of $368 million a year prior.

The number of Snapchat+ paying subscribers is now at 12 million, the company said. That is up from the 11 million it reported in August. The company debuted its subscription service in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to experience exclusive and prerelease features for $3.99 a month.

Snap also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program on Tuesday.

“Our investments in AI and AR are powering new creative experiences for our community and driving innovation across our advertising platform, underpinning our long term growth opportunity,” Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in a statement.

In September, Snap debuted the fifth generation of its Spectacles augmented reality glasses that people can wear to see digital imagery spliced into the physical world. The new Spectacles are only available to developers who must pay $99 a month for one year if they want to build AR apps for the glasses.

Shortly after Snap announced the new Spectacles, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed the social networking giant’s experimental AR glasses called Orion. Meta’s Orion AR glasses have generated enthusiasm from employees and the company plans to attract developers next year in prelude for an eventual consumer launch.

In a letter to investors, Snap discussed the importance that developers play for the company’s Spectacles and AR initiatives.

“We aspire to be the most developer-friendly platform in the world, and we are excited to offer our new generation of Spectacles to developers as an invitation and inspiration to create new experiences,” Snap said in the letter.

2024-10-24,22:25:58,stocks,Tesla stock has best day in over a decade on Musk's 2025 growth projection,"Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.

The company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.

“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.

Tesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.

Automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.

Tesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”

CEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.

Even bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk’s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a “maybe.” They set their estimate at 14%.

It “clearly depends on the company’s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.

A grain of salt

Musk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.

Bernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: “The tone of Tesla’s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.”

Musk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn’t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. 

The Bernstein analysts wrote, “We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.”

They pointed to Musk’s “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD” and said crowdsourced research that shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.

The share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla’s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.

2024-10-24,14:52:29,stocks,"Tesla’s Not a Car Company, Musk’s in the Business of Selling the Future. And 5 Other Things to Know Today.","

It may surprise some to learn that Tesla isn’t really in the car business.

Sure, some 80% of its revenue currently comes from electric vehicles. And CEO Elon Musk is pretty good at squeezing profit out of those cars—something many in the industry still haven’t managed to figure out.

But the most important thing to know about the company is that it trades on more than 70 times forward earnings. Ford and General Motors are on five or six times. This suggests that when investors buy Tesla stock, their expectations are in a different universe from when they buy into other car makers.

Musk is pulling old-school levers to ensure his cars are profitable, even as rivals churn out lower-cost models. It helps that Tesla can now make more vehicles from the same manufacturing base and squeeze suppliers to cushion margins.

At the same time, a closer look at the earnings yesterday—which beat Wall Street estimates—show Tesla’s profits come from plenty of other sources. It made money from software, from selling regulatory credits for making more than its share of zero-emission cars, and from battery storage and charging.

Of course, robotaxis and self-driving cars are the next frontier. They’re not really cars—the robotaxi won’t even have a steering wheel or pedals. They are a bet on technology and artificial intelligence, not the automotive industry. It’s why Tesla is one of Nvidia’s best customers.

There’s a story about Ray Kroc, the businessman who made McDonald’s the most successful fast-food corporation, and the value of knowing exactly what business you’re really in. For McDonald’s, it’s real estate, not hamburgers.

Elon Musk knows he’s not in the car business. He’s selling the future. The tricky part will be delivering on his promises when expectations are already so high.

2024-10-23,22:16:25,stocks,Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat,"* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

# 

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. ""As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time,"" noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our ""We, Robot"" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-10-23,14:35:32,stocks,Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025?,"We believe Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2-trillion figure now – potentially becoming the world’s most valuable company by a huge margin – as its often-overlooked Waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. This would take the stock to over $500 a share. Here’s why.

Fact: Waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10,000 to over 100,000 in the last 12 months. It went from 50,000 weekly rides to 100,000 just in the last six months.

The growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive

Case in point: Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let’s let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market, that would mean 100 million rides per week. That’s about 1,000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride, we’re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year.

But wait… there is more to the growth story

If Waymo is already delivering over 100,000 driverless rides, how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles? The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab, there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat, streaming Netflix, while they’re stuck behind the wheel.

In fact, early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to national rates for human-operated cars.

Investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride-hailing market has substantial growth potential – it could easily expand by 2-3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn’t out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies.

But wait aren’t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving?

Yes, but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor, General Motor’s backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident, making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self-driving space, given its large base of vehicles, it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month.

Waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don’t forget Google’s got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base, using that to train its machine-learning models. That’s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments.

The best part?

These are self-driving cars – no human drivers, no unions, no employee or contractor issues, and no human cost. While there will be other expenses, such as software development and battery costs, the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50% aren’t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride-hailing models.

If Waymo can capture about one-third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market, it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50% margin, that’s a neat $150 billion in profits. What’s that worth? At a 30x earnings multiple, that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently, this could take the company’s market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or over $500 per share.

To be sure, building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time – quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach.

Should I sell a portion of the profit and repurchase meta (long-term investing), or should I keep it for the future without touching it

The Stock is a strong stock and is expected to grow more, but I hear ppl say that I need to take part of the profit and then reinvest it again. other say, just leave it and don't think about it.

2024-10-18,07:03:01,stocks,"Large cap tech, Nvidia, and by extension US index funds are likely to crash, small cap value/international to outperform. Here's why","If you look at the story of how the S&P500 has performed so well over the past decade, the answer is high return on invested capital from tech companies. By hiring top engineers to build innovative products, and scaling the product globally, these companies to achieved rapid growth at little cost, resulting in impressive returns to shareholders. Historically, hardware costs were very cheap to scale compared to the revenue it brings in. You could spend a few thousand per month in hosting costs, and bring in millions in profits.

However, this is changing. 7 out of 10 of the top holdings in the S&P500 are gambling huge on AI- they have laid off tens of thousands of the talented engineers that drove their earnings growth, in order to fund expensive acquisitions of AI hardware(Not counting Nvidia because they are the ones profiting from it).

Tech can no longer be seen as an industry with low capital costs, because AI is tremendously expensive to deploy and maintain. For example, Microsoft expects to spend $100 Billion on AI datacenters through Fiscal 2027. That's 40% more than their entire profit in 2023. Because AI hardware is so expensive, and the electricity usage is so tremendous, these future applications are no longer cheap to deploy and maintain.

ChatGPT is perhaps the best example of this. Despite being tremendously successful from a growth perspective, it has been tremendously unprofitable from an operating standpoint, and relies on continued bailouts from large companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Softbank to stay afloat. 

The economics of tech companies is quickly changing; with companies in an arms race to acquire as many Nvidia chips as possible to build the best GenAI applications, they are hurting their margins and operating profitability.

The impact of these investments has been quite lousy so far; other than some round tripping transactions to create fake revenue and balance sheet growth, these ai investments, while tremendously expensive, have not paid off:

- Microsoft's CoPilot has been a complete failure, consumers are not buying CoPilot pcs, and the CoPilot app has a 2.3 star rating on the Windows store. They are also facing regulatory pressure in Europe over Recall.

- Google's AI is providing dangerous and potentially deadly misinformation to users of its search engine, such as incorrect advice about prescriptions.

- Amazon's ""Go"" stores were supposed to use ML/AI to handle checkouts, when in reality, the AI failed to handle most of the work, and the remainder was just outsourced to human operators in India which struggled to keep up with the workload.

- Tesla has still failed to implement full self driving, and during its robotaxi event, had human actors control the robots to fake them being AI controlled.

- Google's Waymo is very impressive from a technology standpoint, but its hardware costs and regulatory barriers make it unlikely to achieve profitability, even as it expands.

Despite the poor results of AI investments so far, all of the top 10 holdings in the S&P500 other than Berkshire Hathaway trade at very high P/E Ratio, suggesting that very high earnings growth is priced in.

Even if AI will have a significant impact on the economy and society, the economics of it are not favorable to investors due to the high capex costs involved. Tech is no longer an industry where a team of 10-20 engineers can build a product that brings in Billions in revenue, with minimal hosting costs. It is now an industry where Billions of capital expenditures are needed just to build a model, and margins on the finished product are very poor.

Of course, tech CEOs realize this; which is why Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google are all working to replace Nvidia hardware, which sells at a huge markup, with their own in house chips. This is a tremendous threat to Nvidia's long term prospects.

Given the high expectations implied by elevated price to earnings ratios, and the poor financial performance of AI applications, it does seem quite unlikely that large caps will continue to outperform.

Small cap value and international stocks are almost certainly a better investment; if AI does drive significant productivity improvements, then labor heavy businesses will benefit from improved margins from using these products that large tech companies are offering.

Looking at small cap value funds like AVUV, and international stock indexes, there are a tremendous amount of labor intensive businesses with low margins in these funds that would benefit from AI/ML. Net margins going from 3% to 10% due to improved productivity would mean earnings more than tripling.

This has historically been the case with technical revolutions. For example, railroads revolutionized our economy and drove tremendous economic growth, but they provided terrible returns to shareholders.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-10-16,15:12:01,stocks,Any company you wanna short? Looking for empty air stocks with 70-100%+ run-ups in 2024,"So obviously like most people, there's my index ETF portfolio. I want to hedge it against the risk of a ""doom scenario"" which we have been preparing for since 2021.

We all can offer excellent ideas on what companies are great, and which stocks to buy, but I'm looking for easy short ideas, so the inverse function -

* Empty air projections and growth expectations, no moat
* High regulatory risk, e.g. crypto 
* Sky high valuations, abnormal PE, PS ratios 
* Sky high run-up in price, e.g. 70-100% shoot up YTD
* Excessive media attention, which can quickly changes narrative

Couple of ideas that I can think of:

* Tesla (but who knows they might just deliver, finally)
* Walmart (digital is coming, digital is coming since 2010)
* Uber - discretionary spending in recession? Also, it spikes up when Tesla falls, so I don't like the rationale based on other company's failure 
* Vici - casino, hotels, resorts in recession? 
* And, please ""murder me"" for saying this - NVDA?",TSLA,Tesla
2024-10-14,22:19:59,stocks,Nvidia closes at record as AI chipmaker's market cap tops $3.4 trillion,"Nvidia shares closed at a record on Monday as Wall Street gears up for earnings season and updates from all of the chipmaker’s top customers on their planned spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The stock climbed 2.4% to close at $138.07, topping its prior high of $135.58 on June 18. The shares are now up almost 180% for the year and have soared more than nine-fold since the beginning of 2023.

Nvidia, widely viewed as the company selling the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, has been the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom, which started with the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to create and deploy advanced AI models that power ChatGPT and similar applications.

Companies including Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in large quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.

Of the billions of dollars the top tech companies are spending annually on their AI buildouts, an outsized amount is going to Nvidia, which controls about 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, according to analysts at Mizuho.

Nvidia’s revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and at least tripled in three of those periods. Growth is expected to modestly slow the rest of the year, with analysts projecting expansion of about 82% to $32.9 billion in the quarter ending in October, according to LSEG.

Nvidia recently said that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is “insane” and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.

With a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is the second most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, behind Apple at about $3.55 trillion.

2024-10-12,17:03:00,stocks,"Ride-sharing giants Uber, Lyft jump after Tesla’s ‘toothless taxi’ fails to excite investors","Tesla’s hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber’s ride-sharing aspirations, but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead.

Uber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday’s event — particularly slumping in early August and mid-September — but surged more than 9% on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52-week high and it was leading the S&P 500 higher during the session.

That is a massive turnaround for Uber’s stock, which is now up nearly 22% over the past month and about 38% for the year. Lyft, another major player, is also surging about 10% on Friday. By comparison, Tesla’s shares are plunging during Friday’s trading session and are down more than 11% this year, vastly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, which have each gained around 22% so far this year.

The buzz around Tesla’s highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self-driving technology advancements and the company’s failure to provide insight on its ride-sharing service strategy or economics, among other expectations investors had.

“TSLA’s toothless taxi is a best-case outcome for UBER,” Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note, noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.

2024-10-11,18:45:39,stocks,Tesla is Completely out of Touch with Needs of Taxi Services. ,"Seeing a lot of focus on the Temu Boston Dynamics bot, but not a lot of discussion on the robo taxi. 

How this thing is built tells me how out of touch and unprepared Tesla is to seriously compete in ride servicing. 

First off this thing has two seats, that alone is such a dumb design decision. It had to be Elon that said to keep it as two seats so it looks futuristic and aesthetic. What if I want to travel with a small group of people? I’m not using the LAX shuttle van at that point, I’m immediately turning to a competitor. Haven’t really seen anyone comment on how out of touch and unnecessary that was. 

One other concern I have is how Tesla primarily uses cameras. What if there are sirens and a fire truck, ambulance, or police car is blowing through an intersection. Other autonomous vehicles incorporate sound, I’m not too sure Tesla does. If not it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. 

Beyond this there’s the ridiculous price tag he put on it which it’ll probably be nowhere close to. 

What are other people’s thoughts on this, did anything with this Robotaxi actually look like a feasible product to you? It looks like an aesthetic toy, but not an actual product that can compete in the space. Based on my understanding of a typical car design cycle, redesigning this to add four instead of just 2 seats would take probably another 2-4 years at least. To me it seems like they really just showed they lost on their biggest bet in the near future. 


Edit: Alright read through the comments, and still think the 2 seat no steering wheel design is stupid. People are saying this is meant to also be a personal commuter car. So my choices are to buy a 30K Robotaxi (knowing Tesla’s history this WILL be priced higher) and then ALSO get a model 3 or model Y to drive around my family for ANOTHER 40K when I can just get ONE model 3 or any other self driving car, no Robotaxi and do everything I need? How is that budget friendly at all, and if there’s a nicer car with a steering wheel that self drives why would I buy something without the option of a steering wheel? 
Still a toy.
 
Also, if it’s for personal use, how does this know where to park at my office or how to get past a security gate to private property? If I live in a condo building with a garage how does it know how to get out of the parking garage and where my parking space is? It makes no sense as a personal car for a LOT of people.

And even if the majority of taxi rides are 1-2 people, why not just use a model 3 that’s 10K more, already exists, and can service that additional 15-20% of your taxi market (given the Robotaxi is definitely not gonna cost 30K and over the life of the car the extra seats pay for themselves). You also save on all the costs that it took to make a stupid 2 seater when it came to expanding production lines/capacity, testing, and designing the pointless thing.

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-10-10,04:40:55,stocks,AMD AI event on Oct 10: Any expectations?,"I haven't seen any update about AMD able to improve their supply issues to improve MI300 cards, nor do I see wide adoption. A few months ago couple ""AI Datacenter"" startups shared stage with AMD about their new offerings with MI300 but some of them have quietly embraced NVDA and abandoned AMD due to poor supply.

No good news which highlights how META uses these cards and any performance benefits in training or inference on MI300. Azure and OCI clouds have some regions with few MI300 compute instances but I have not seen any customer success stories using these vs using Nvidia older generation T4, A100 and H100s.

2024-10-07,16:33:26,stocks,Robotaxis are here and the public is divided. Alphabet owned Waymo is the leader in the space. Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi launch.,"Driverless cars are speeding onto America’s streets, but whether the public will trust robotaxis remains an open question. 

Nearly two-thirds of Americans said they would not want to ride in a driverless passenger vehicle if they had the opportunity, according to a Pew Research Center Survey. That’s because residents in cities that have yet to experience robotaxis remain unfamiliar with the technology while those in cities with driverless cabs have not yet forgotten about high-profile accidents involving other companies, like GM-owned Cruise. 

Now Tesla, the loudest and most bullish self-driving proponent of them all, is due to unveil its long-awaited robotaxi after years of unfulfilled promises.

The company’s existing autonomous driving technology, where a human is still at the wheel, has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and multiple lawsuits after hundreds of crashes. Experts say a great presentation from CEO Elon Musk won’t guarantee a safe robotaxi network.

Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi launch threatens to throw the whole autonomous vehicle space off course. 

Alphabet-owned Waymo is the leader in the space, with the company claiming it has notched more than 22 million driverless miles. It has proven that there is strong consumer demand, with weekly paid rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin doubling in just a couple months. And Waymo has worked on building its reputation, launching an online safety hub with data arguing that its cars are safer than human drivers.

Besides Tesla, other competitors are also looking to jump into the race.

Amazon says it is getting ready to roll out its fleet of Zoox cars, and Cruise is resuming operations after a 2023 accident led regulators to ground the fleet. Wall Street is already looking ahead to a driverless future, with one analyst arguing that if it hadn’t been for generative AI, 2024 would have been the year of the robotaxi. 

As driverless networks scale, one of the fiercest debates is whether ride-sharing will survive. Robotaxis may cause consumers to question if they really want to book an Uber or Lyft and talk to a stranger, sit in someone else’s car and tip a human if there is a driverless alternative. Uber has hedged its bets by inking high-profile deals with autonomous vehicle companies, but it’s unclear how long those partnerships will last.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-10-05,17:45:28,stocks,Whats your take on RDDT?,"Possibly a bit biased from posting this on reddit but reddit stock but it's been one of the few ipos in recent years that been performing well since inception. 

Idk about you but I tend to use reddit to find answers or opinions more than any other platform. Besides that marketing/ad revenue can be a real show stopper to continue growing if done right (cough meta and google)

I do see that the valuation is a bit rich with a p/s of 10x compared to something like meta and it's been around for 19 years so ita questionable if they can actually grow the way they should post ipo to be profitable.

Imo the reach for new users will continue to grow faster and faster thanks to their agreement with Google and OpenAi. 

In addtion, there's a level of a distruptive/moat advantage considering this is the message board of the internet for all things. There's nothing quiet like this platform.

2024-10-04,23:22:49,stocks,Which stock is hidding in plain sight?,"Coming out of the Great Financial Crisis, Apple was a stock that was criminally undervalued, despite being a massive brand already. Over the years, there weren’t any groundbreaking inventions (outside of expanding their services), yet the stock still managed to significantly outperform the market. Even Warren Buffett, who bought in later, snagged it at a great valuation.

Now that the Fed seems to be normalizing rates and the economy has shown resilience, I’m thinking about which companies might be ""hiding in plain sight"" today.

A lot of people are betting on AI related plays, with many pointing to TSMC and ASML as indirect winners. I get the logic, but I believe that, no matter how successful they become, these companies will still trade at lower valuations compared to their U.S. counterparts. Money just tends to flow into U.S. equities first and foremost.

Personally, I think Meta is the best positioned among the ""Magnificent 7."" The TikTok threat has mostly passed, and it could even be a net positive for Meta not to be viewed as a monopoly anymore. Plus, I don’t think their AI and AR/VR investments are fully priced into the stock yet.

Amazon is lagging the other mega caps in terms of valuation, but there’s still some uncertainty around how well Andy Jassy will perform in the long term.

Any stocks you guys are eyeing? I’m particularly interested in established companies with consistent growth that still seem under represented.


tldr: Apple was once undervalued despite being a massive brand, and I'm wondering which companies today are in a similar position. AI stocks like TSMC/ASML seem popular, but I think Meta is well positioned due to AI/AR investments not yet fully priced in. Amazon also lags but could be worth watching under new leadership.

> Facebook owner Meta announced on Friday it had built a new AI model called Movie Gen that can create realistic-seeming video and audio clips in response to user prompts, claiming it can rival tools from leading media generation startups like OpenAI and ElevenLabs. Samples of Movie Gen’s creations provided by Meta showed videos of animals swimming and surfing, as well as videos using people’s real photos to depict them performing actions like painting on a canvas. Movie Gen also can generate background music and sound effects synced to the content of the videos, Meta said in a blog post, and use the tool to edit existing videos.

> In one such video, Meta had the tool insert pom-poms into the hands of a man running by himself in the desert, while in another it changed a parking lot where a man was skateboarding from dry ground into one covered by a splashing puddle. Videos created by Movie Gen can be up to 16 seconds long, while audio can be up to 45 seconds long, Meta said. It shared data showing blind tests indicating that the model performs favorably compared with offerings from startups including Runway, OpenAI, ElevenLabs and Kling.

> The announcement comes as Hollywood has been wrestling with how to harness generative AI video technology this year, after Microsoft -backed OpenAI in February first showed off how its product Sora could create feature film-like videos in response to text prompts.

2024-10-02,15:10:06,stocks,"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter","Tesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890

Total production Q3 2024: 469,796

Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.

Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It’s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.

In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.

Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.

In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.

GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla’s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company’s total sales.

Ford plans to report results on Wednesday.

Tesla hasn’t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.

The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.

Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.

Tesla’s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called “racist hate,” and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.

But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.

In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.

Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of “dedicated robotaxi.”

Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.

2024-10-01,17:23:05,stocks,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|

|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time.

2024-10-01,17:23:05,stocks,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|

|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. 

**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**

2024-09-27,12:04:39,stocks,'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**

  
Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:

* Waymo: 17,311 miles
* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles
* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles
* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles

The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  


**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”

  
According to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.

Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.



In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30

2024-09-25,21:42:22,stocks,"Meta unveils $299 Quest 3S VR headset, Orion AR glasses prototype ","Meta announced the Quest 3S, the latest virtual reality headset to come out of the company’s Reality Labs division and a cheaper offering than its predecessor.

The device will go on sale on Oct. 15, and it’ll retail starting at $299, down from the $499 starting price for 2023′s Quest 3. The device can be used to watch movies, as well as run VR fitness apps and gaming, Meta said Wednesday at its Connect event in Menlo Park, California. The company positioned the headset as a multitasking computer, putting it in competition with Apple’s $3,499 Vision Pro headset that launched in February.

In addition to the Quest 3S, Meta on Wednesday also showcased its latest prototype of augmented-reality smart glasses and announced a flurry of new features for its Meta AI chatbot.

Meta’s previous Quest devices are the bestselling VR headsets, with millions shipped thanks to heavy marketing and a lower price than many competitors, but those efforts have yet to spark a cultural phenomenon or a mainstream software ecosystem around VR. Including its acquisition of Oculus in 2014, Meta has poured more than $65 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company’s spending as a strategic initiative to prevent Apple from controlling future hardware platforms.

Although there was hope among VR developers that Apple’s entry into the market would spur a wave of new apps and users, Apple hasn’t revealed sales for its headset and reports suggest that sales have been in small volumes, under 1 million units, partially due to its high price.

What it does

A Meta representative said the “S” in Quest 3S stands for “start” — as in getting started with VR.

Many of the new Meta features that the company discussed for the $299 Quest 3S have counterparts on Apple’s Vision Pro, including a mode that allows for the device to be used on an airplane and another that simulates a large movie theater inside the headset.

Meta highlighted improved “passthrough,” the term used to described when a VR headset uses cameras and sensors on the outside of the device to display live real-time video inside the headset. That function is intended to make users feel like they are looking through a display and allows them to interact with the real world while keeping the headset on. For the Quest 3S, Meta added a dedicated button to turn on passthrough.

The company has emphasized the ability of the Quest 3S to multitask and run apps, positioning it as a computing device, instead of a game console.

“All the things you can do with a general purpose computer, Quest is the full package,” Zuckerberg said.

In demos provided Tuesday, Meta showcased the device running as many as four apps at one time on floating screens inside the headset, including a YouTube video, a browser, Amazon Music and Meta’s app store. Meta says the headset can handle six windows. But the demo experience was not smooth. The Amazon Music app crashed, window controls would disappear and Meta’s controllers would fall asleep after a few minutes if the user wasn’t pressing buttons.

Besides the Quest 3S, Meta also announced a price cut for last’s year Quest 3, bringing the price of the 512GB version down from $649 to $499. The Quest 3 has more advanced lenses and a superior screen with a higher resolution than the Quest 3S.

Additionally, Meta said it will discontinue the Quest Pro, its $999 headset launched in 2022 that never gained much momentum, and the older Quest 2 headset.

Eventually, glasses

Zuckerberg’s justification for spending so much on VR and AR is his belief that the technology will eventually end up in lightweight, transparent glasses that overlay computer graphics and information onto the real world.

Investing in VR software and hardware are early steps toward those glasses, which could take as much as a decade to develop, Zuckerberg previously said.

Zuckerberg showed off an early concept of what those glasses could look like on Wednesday. The thick, black-framed prototype, called Orion, won’t be sold to consumers, but Meta says they will be used internally as the company continues working toward the consumer glasses it hopes to one day sell.

“This is where we are going,” Zuckerberg said.

Meta hopes the next version of Orion will be available to consumers as the company’s first full AR glasses, Zuckerberg said without giving a timetable for when that may be.

Orion is Meta’s first “fully-functioning” prototype AR glasses, Zuckerberg said, and the device is tethered wirelessly to a small “puck.” The prototype uses a wristband component to pick up on users neural signals and let them control the Orion glasses using their brains. That technology stems from the company’s 2019 acquisition of CTRL-Labs.

Orion enables users to play games, multi-task with multiple windows and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar, Zuckerberg said.

Meta’s Orion prototype comes a week after Snap announced its fifth-generation Spectacles AR glasses. Those thick-framed glasses will only be made available to developers, who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build AR apps for the device.

This isn’t the first time Meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where VR and AR technology is headed. The Orion glasses are an improvement on Project Nazare, prototype smart glasses that Zuckerberg announced in 2021, when the company changed its name from Facebook.

Meta does sell a pair of glasses with a built-in camera in partnership with EssilorLuxottica called Ray-Ban Meta, which start at $299 and were announced in 2023. While these glasses don’t have any displays, they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with Meta AI, the company’s voice assistant.

As part of Wednesday’s event, Meta announced new Meta AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses.

For example, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in Spanish and, if asked, can translate in the user’s ear, a new improvement, Meta said. The camera can scan QR codes, and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes.

Another new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked. 

Li-Chen Miller, the vice president of product in charge of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, told CNBC that when she travels, she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door, and later, she asks Meta AI to recall the number. 

Those features will become available “later this year,” the company said.

The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have sold more than 730,000 units in their first three quarters, according to market researcher IDC. In July, Zuckerberg told investors that they were “a bigger hit sooner than expected.”

Last week, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses.

AI that speaks

Zuckerberg also introduced improvements to its Meta AI chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice in addition to written prompts.

With voice, users will be able to have oral conversations with Meta AI, which is accessed through Meta’s apps. Users will be able to perform actions using their voice, such as telling Meta AI to take a photo by talking to their smartphone.

For Meta AI’s new feature, the company is using computer-generated voices from celebrities including Awkwafina, Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and Kristen Bell.

The new Siri-like Meta AI voice feature will be available over the next month for U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand users of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.

The Meta AI announcement comes a day after rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, announced an advanced voice feature for people who pay for its premium service.

Meta’s new chatbot features are based on the company’s AI model, Llama. Meta on Wednesday announced a newer version of Llama, called Llama 3.2. This updated model can understand both images and text, an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people’s written prompts.

2024-09-19,16:47:09,stocks,Are European automakers headed for a death spiral?,"I don't intend to exaggerate, but I am getting the sense that the auto industry in Europe (Germany especially) is on its death bed. 

## Falling Euro EV Sales / Shrinking EV Share

[Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-19/germany-s-slump-in-ev-sales-drags-on-europe-s-auto-market) 

> EV deliveries in the region’s biggest car market [(Germany)] fell 69% during August, fueling a 36% drop across the region, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said Thursday. [...] With the battery-car market share shrinking to 14% in August — down from just over 15% last year 

[Figure of the above statistics](https://i.imgur.com/5eFiBdk.png). Germany cutting subsidies was a big blow to the industry. [New car registrations also dropping](https://i.imgur.com/w9SKOjh.png). From same [Bloomberg article:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-19/germany-s-slump-in-ev-sales-drags-on-europe-s-auto-market) 

> Across Europe, new-car registrations dropped 16.5% compared to a year ago to 755,717 million units last month with declines also in France and Italy. The UK was the only major market where EV sales rose, gaining 10.8%.

European plants are underutilized because they make more than they need. [From DW:](https://www.dw.com/en/volkswagens-crisis-how-can-europes-car-industry-survive/a-70231806)

> One in three European factories of carmaking behemoths like BMW, Mercedes, Stellantis, Renault and Volkswagen is underutilized. In some of their plants, less than half of the vehicles that could theoretically be produced are actually being made. 

## Examples of hard-hit companies

VW is planning to layoff 15K, possibly closing 2-3 plants in Germany (for the first time). Ending job security program that prevents layoffs through 2029. VW union workers are not happy and are threatening strikes. BMW cutting guidance for operating margins by 200 basis points (to 6-7%). [An Audi plant in Brussels facing closure](https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/audi-brussels-plant-closure-threat-sparks-belgium-national-strike). Stellantis plant in Italy facing 60% fall in production in 2024.


## The Threat of Chinese Exports to US/Europe

Meanwhile, China is the new auto giant. [This graph of exports by country is from early 2024](https://i.imgur.com/nPAd2wh.jpeg)--China is the Japan of the 1980s. The threat of Chinese competition is so high that EU is considering 50% tariffs (currently 15% on Chinese EVs), while the US is at 100%. In past years, I've always heard that Chinese cars are junk. Junk cars wouldn't need to need to have their price doubled to keep consumers from buying them. In other countries, Chinese brands are taking over the nascent EV market: ""Chinese automakers accounted for 88% of the EV market in Brazil and 70% in Thailand in the first quarter of this year.""

In Europe, despite tariffs: ""Chinese carmakers' share of passenger car sales in Europe rose to 17% in the first seven months of 2024 from 12% a year earlier, according to data from automotive consultancy Inovev, and Chinese car exports have reached record highs this year."" [(Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-auto-suppliers-ev-makers-flood-major-trade-fair-germany-2024-09-10/).

## Shifts in China's Domestic Markets 

The Chinese automobile renaissance is killing foreign producers in China, yet another sign that these cars in China are actually comparable quality. 

> Foreign brands’ market share of Chinese auto sales is tracking at a record low of 37 per cent in the first seven months of 2024, down from 64 per cent in 2020, according to data from Automobility, a Shanghai consultancy. So far this year, US brands are down more than 23 per cent while Japanese, Korean and German carmakers have also suffered double-digit declines, the data showed. By contrast, sales of Chinese brands are up nearly 22 per cent with Chinese companies overwhelmingly dominating sales of the EV market.

[Here's Ford CEO/CFO](https://www.businessinsider.com/ford-ceo-cfo-left-shocked-after-chinese-ev-test-drive-2024-9) being shocked by the quality of Chinese EVs in a test drive. [Longer article here](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ford-china-ev-competition-farley-ceo-50ded461?st=86lo43cq3ccgaz6&reflink=article_copyURL_share).

## Technological Edge in EVs for China?

[Nearly 40% of Chinese auto sales are of EVs](https://i.imgur.com/cqX6jts.png) versus 10% for the US and 21% for Europe. Aren't the US/EU supposed to be championing the green revolution in autos? BYD had a 5% share of Chinese cars in 2022--today it's 20%.  That's a big threat to Tesla for instance, who gets 20% of its revenue from China.

## Possible Bull Case

So  is there a bull case for VW? Here is a [Sum of the Parts](https://x.com/StanphylCap/status/1832096596319727717) bull case for Volkswagen. VW owns stakes in Porche, Traton in addition to owning Audi, VW cars, Skoda, Seat, Cupra Lamborghini, Bentley and Ducati. I don't fully understand how the debt impacts the analysis here, though. OP claims the debt is held by a captive finance arm and fully secured by leased cars + non-recourse (only collateral can be pursued, nothing more).

## Closing Thoughts

How are European automakers going to handle the competitive threat of a new Chinese auto juggernaut along with massive fiscal support in the US (from the IRA)? Their energy prices face much higher spikes [than in the US and China](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliasferrerbreda/2023/09/21/energy-europes-big-disadvantage/). Labor unions are much more powerful in Europe, making cost cuts difficult. Autos are already a very difficult sector to invest in, but I suspect European cars brands may be uninvestible and they are rightfully cheap on a P/E basis (if earnings are even positive).

*****
> The Fed slashed its overnight lending rate to a range of 4.75% to 5% from 5.25% to 5.5% on Wednesday, which came as a surprise to some investors who criticized the size of this initial cut. This is the first rate reduction delivered by the Fed in four years.

*****
> After seesawing for most of Wednesday afternoon, stocks ultimately closed the session lower. Both the S&P 500 and 30-stock Dow initially rallied to new record highs right after the Fed announced its interest rate cut decision.

2024-09-13,16:29:17,stocks,Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-sharing trips in Austin and Atlanta ,"Uber announced Friday it is expanding its partnership with Alphabet’s Waymo to offer robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta beginning in early 2025. Shares of Uber jumped 5% on the news while Alphabet rose about 1%.

Uber riders in those cities can be matched with a driverless Waymo car for some trips, according to the companies. The rides will only be available through Uber’s app, unlike in San Francisco and Los Angeles where riders book through the Waymo app. A Waymo spokesperson said it had no plans to partner with Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The expansion comes as Uber faces investor pressure to step up its autonomous vehicle strategy, especially ahead of Tesla’s planned robotaxi event slated for Oct. 10. Shares of Uber have fallen 9% since the Tesla event was announced and are off 17% from their 52-week highs. 

It may also slow Waymo encroachment into Uber’s market share. An analysis from Bernstein estimated that, as of May 2024, Waymo’s 50,000 weekly paid rides made up approximately 2% of ride-sharing usage in San Francisco. Since then, Waymo has doubled its paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 a week, the company announced. 

“We’re thrilled to build on our successful partnership with Waymo, which has already powered fully autonomous trips for tens of thousands of riders in Phoenix,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a release. 

Uber’s initial agreement with Waymo in Phoenix also included autonomous Uber Eats deliveries in the city. The expansion into Austin and Atlanta won’t include Uber Eats at first, according to the Waymo spokesperson, but they’re exploring that possibility for the future. 

Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said, “We’ve been delighted at the positive feedback from our Waymo One riders to date, and we can’t wait to bring the comfort, convenience, and safety of the Waymo Driver to these cities in partnership with Uber.” 

The expansion into two more cities is another step in Uber’s advancement into the robotaxi space, after struggling to get a foothold and selling off its own self-driving division in 2020, now relying on partnerships with companies including Waymo, GM’s Cruise and the SoftBank-backed U.K. startup Wayve to gain ground. 

Uber shares dipped in August after the company announced a multiyear partnership with Cruise to offer autonomous rides through its app next year. Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski cited Cruise’s previous safety challenges as a part of the investor skepticism, along with now-fulfilled hopes for a partnership with Waymo instead. 

Waymo has rapidly made strides in the self-driving race. It currently offers robotaxi services to the public in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix. It has logged more than 22 million miles through June of this year, and last week, it released a report that argued its vehicles are safer than human drivers. It began testing driverless cars on Bay Area freeways with Google employees in August.

Some analysts were more hopeful for a potential Uber and Waymo expansion into San Francisco. But Atlanta and Austin, where Waymo has already begun testing, may still help sentiment.

2024-09-12,03:15:27,stocks,"Oracle trails only Nvidia among large-cap tech this year, as Ellison closes in on Bezos","Larry Ellison turned 80 last month. It’s been a celebratory year.

While fellow legacy tech players Intel and Cisco struggle to find their footing in a world driven increasingly by the promise of artificial intelligence, Oracle has emerged as a Wall Street darling.

Following a better-than-expected [earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/oracle-orcl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html) after the close on Monday, the stock popped 11% on Tuesday. It gained more steam on Wednesday, closing at a record $157.10. Oracle has seen double-digit gains following each of its three quarterly reports this year, driven by the company’s cloud businesses. The stock didn’t have a single double-digit increase last year and had only one in 2022.

“The excitement is back,” Guggenheim analysts titled their post-earnings report, highlighting “momentum across all business.”

Oracle shares are now up 49% this year, trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia — up 136% — among large-cap tech stocks. The next best performer in the group is Meta, which has gained 45%.

Intel, meanwhile, has lost 60% of its value and Cisco is down almost 3%. Both companies announced major layoffs in their earnings reports last month.

The biggest financial winner from Oracle’s rally is Ellison, who founded the software company in 1977 and remains chairman. He owns over 40% of the outstanding stock and has seen his net worth swell to $192 billion, according to Forbes. Only Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($251 billion) and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($202 billion) are wealthier.

By the standards of high-growth tech, Oracle remains fairly plodding.

Revenue increased 8% in the latest quarter from a year earlier to $13.31 billion. For the current period, growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call.

Since 2011, Oracle has had only one year of double-digit revenue growth — 18% in fiscal 2023 — and four times the company has contracted.

“After 13 years of single-digit organic total revenue growth, Oracle is reaccelerating into the double digits,” JMP analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday, bumping up their rating to buy from hold. “We remain very EPS confident and committed to full-year total revenue growth growing double digits.”

Oracle is currently in the midst of its CloudWorld conference, which wraps up on Thursday in Las Vegas. Between the earnings report and the annual event, investors are applauding the company’s cloud story, including both its infrastructure business and its databases.

While Oracle is still way behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google in terms of cloud infrastructure market share, the business has turned into a big growth driver for the company. Revenue in the unit surged 45% in the quarter from a year earlier to $2.2 billion.

In addition to competing with the top cloud companies, Oracle is increasingly partnering with them.

A year ago, Ellison visited Microsoft’s headquarters outside of Seattle for the first time, announcing a collaboration with a company he’d competed with for more than 30 years.

On Monday, Oracle said its database software will become available for AWS customers to use atop Oracle hardware sitting inside of Amazon data centers. Oracle has forged such arrangements with all three major cloud infrastructure vendors in the past year.

“We believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come,” Ellison said on Monday’s earnings call.

Oracle didn’t immediately provide a comment for this story.

# ‘No more passwords’

For years, Ellison described Oracle’s database as “autonomous,” playing into the hype around self-driving cars (he used to be on Tesla’s board and is close with Musk) and the emergence of AI. Its product wouldn’t need manual patching and wouldn’t have downtime, and Ellison said no other cloud provider could do it. But of late he’s benefitted from playing nice.

After years of criticizing AWS at events, Ellison decided to ensure that clients are able to use Amazon’s market-leading cloud with Oracle’s full-featured database.

“Of course, customers have been able to use Oracle inside of AWS for a long time,” AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC in a recent interview. But the new offering will allow clients to easily sign up in the AWS marketplace of third-party software, make backups and move data to AWS analytics tools, Garman said.

Garman, who replaced Adam Selipsky as AWS CEO in June, added that clients had been asking the two companies to figure out how to work more closely together.

As Ellison digs deeper into AI and enters his 81st year on the planet, he’s now taking on passwords, which he calls “utterly ridiculous” because they’re insecure and can be “easily hacked.”

“This is the way log-on is going to work,” Ellison said on the earnings call. “I’m going to type in Larry.Ellison@oracle.com, the computer is going to look at me and say, ‘OK, Hi Larry.’ We’re done.”

He went on to say that Catz can recognize him as can his kids, so there’s no reason his computer shouldn’t be able to the same.

“No more passwords,” he said. “Those have got to go.”

2024-09-10,10:14:19,stocks,Apple loses EU court battle over 13 billion euro tax bill in Ireland ,"Europe’s top court on Tuesday ruled against Apple in the tech giant’s 10-year court battle over its tax affairs in Ireland.

The pronouncement from the European Court of Justice comes hours after Apple unveiled a swathe of new product offerings, looking to revitalize its iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPod line-ups.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. The company’s shares were down 1% in premarket trading at 09:07 a.m. London time.

In 2014, the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, opened an investigation into Apple’s tax payments in Ireland, the tech giant’s headquarters in the EU.

The Commission in 2016 ordered Dublin to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple, at the time saying that the tech company had received “illegal” tax benefits from Ireland over the course of two decades.

Apple and Ireland appealed the Commission’s decision in 2019, and in 2020 the EU General Court sided with the U.S. tech giant. The EU’s second-highest court anulled the Commission’s 2016 decision and said that the executive arm did not prove that the Irish government had given Apple a tax advantage.

The Commission in turn appealed the General Court’s decision, sending the litigation up to the ECJ.

The case, which first began under outgoing competition chief Margrethe Vestager, highlights the continued conflict between U.S. tech giants and the EU, which has sought to tackle issues from data protection to taxation and antitrust.

This was not the last time that Apple found itself in the EU’s crosshairs. Most recently, the Commission hit the iPhone maker hit Apple with an antitrust fine of 1.8 billion euro ($1.99 billion) in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

Separately, the EU’s sweeping Digital Markets Act has forced companies to change some of their practices in Europe. The Commission has opened various investigations under the DMA into tech giants, including Apple, Alphabet and Meta.

2024-09-06,17:18:42,stocks,Sen. Elizabeth Warren writes a letter backing the DOJ investigation into Nvidia antitrust allegations,"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-backs-justice-department-nvidia-antitrust-investigation-2024-9

September 5 2024

Dear Assistant Attorney General Kanter.

Competition is key to a thriving U.S. economy and faster economic growth. This is particularly true in the semiconductor market, which will drive future advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and other tech breakthroughs --- the reason Congress provided $52.7 billion in support for the industry in the CHIPS and Science Act.

This is why I welcome the reports that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, whose blockbuster growth has made it one of the world's largest companies. While this growth has been primarily driven by the recent AI boom, it has been supercharged by Nvidia's use of anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation. I am pleased that the DOJ has joined authorities in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the European Union, in investigating Nvidia's conduct.

Until recently, Nvidia was a relatively niche provider of gaming chips, but as a ""prime beneficiary of the Al frenzy,"" it has seen its market capitalization increase by 250% between November 2021 and May 2024. The money involved is vast, and Big Tech is spending most of it: Microsoft and Meta spent a combined $9 billion on Nvidia's chips last year alone. Amazon purchased as many as 50,000 chips in 2023. And Google plans to pour nearly $40 billion into AI this year much of it on Nvidia's products and services.

As a result of this spending, Nvidia now controls an estimated 90% of the market for high-end AI chips and 98% of the lucrative and growing data center graphics processing units (GPUS) market. Its hardware has been the underpinning of almost every AI milestone, including the development and deployment of OpenAl's ChatGPT-4 and other models. Market power like that means the company decides who gets chips from its limited supply and how much they pay, with some experts theorizing that Nvidia has been making a 1000% profit through the retail price of some of its chips. This has effectively made Nvidia the gatekeeper for the world's AI future. 

But in carrying out this responsibility, Nvidia has shown that it is not committed to fair play. The company locks customers in by bundling products, software, and services a practice that has already triggered antitrust scrutiny in France-resulting in Nvidia's own programming software being the only system that is fully compatible with its chips. In a move that was ultimately blocked by the Federal Trade Commission, Nvidia has attempted to further raise barriers to entry by acquiring Arm Limited, the developer of essential chip architecture. If the deal had gone through, experts say Nvidia would have gained control over a software architecture that most of the industry relies on. As Nvidia cements its dominance, venture funders are investing less in companies attempting to build competing chips. Indeed, the number of U.S. venture funding deals for Al chips fell approximately 80% between 2022 and 2023.

The insatiable hunger of gargantuan Big Tech companies for Nvidia chips, along with the company's opaque and preferential allocation of them, are starving startup companies of the infrastructure they need to do business and crowding academic AI researchers out of the field. Allowing a single company so much influence over AI research, development, and monetization poses dire economic risks. Competition powers a virtuous cycle of rapid innovation by impelling each market participant to create the best products. It creates jobs and generates tax revenue. It reduces the need for regulation by giving the market a role in keeping aspiring monopolists in check. It reduces costs for companies by giving them a choice of suppliers.

Without the intervention of U.S. regulators, the prospects of restoring competition in the semiconductor market are bleak. They will only grow bleaker as Nvidia approaches 100% ownership of the market, and as it begins pouring money into lobbying alongside the conventional Big Tech players to shape the contours of AI regulation and lock in its advantage. I thank you for your leadership and support efforts to undertake a comprehensive and fair investigation into Nvidia.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Warren 
United States Senator

2024-09-05,16:45:29,stocks,Snap sued by New Mexico AG over 'sextortion' of kids by predators ,"The New Mexico attorney general filed a lawsuit against Snap, alleging that its social media app Snapchat’s design and algorithmic recommendations “openly foster and promote illicit sexual material involving children and facilitate sextortion and the trafficking of children, drugs, and guns.”

The suit calls Snapchat “a breeding ground for predators to collect sexually explicit images of children and to find, groom and extort them.”

New Mexico Attorney General Raul Torrez, who has a pending lawsuit against Facebook owner Meta for allegedly enabling the sexual exploitation of children, in a statement said, “Snap has misled users into believing that photos and videos sent on their platform will disappear, but predators can permanently capture this content and they have created a virtual yearbook of child sexual images that are traded, sold, and stored indefinitely.

“Through our litigation against Meta and Snap, the New Mexico Department of Justice will continue to hold these platforms accountable for prioritizing profits over children’s safety,” Torrez said.

CNBC has requested comment from Snap about Torrez’s lawsuit, which was filed in the First Judicial District Court in Santa Fe County.

The suit alleges that Snap “repeatedly made statements to the public regarding the safety and design of its platforms that it knew were untrue,” or that were contradicted by the company’s own internal findings.

“Snap was specifically aware, but failed to warn children and parents, of ‘rampant’ and ‘massive’ sextortion on its platform — a problem so grave that it drives children facing merciless and relented blackmail demands or disclosure of intimate images to their families and friends to suicide,” the suit says.

New Mexico’s Department of Justice, which Torrez leads, in recent months conducted an investigation that found that there was a “vast network of dark web sites dedicated to sharing stolen, non-consensual sexual images from Snap” and that there were more than 10,000 records related to SNAP and child sexual abuse material “in the last year alone,” the department said.

The suit alleges violations of New Mexico’s unfair trade practices law.

# [Stock futures are flat after two straight down days for S&P 500, Nasdaq: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were flat Thursday as Wall Street looks to regain momentum after a rocky start to September. Key labor market data is also on deck this week.
*****
> Futures for the S&P 500 were up marginally, while Nasdaq 100 futures hovered near the flatline. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 50 points.
*****
> The moves come after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each closed lower for the second straight session, dipping 0.16% and 0.30%, respectively. The Dow squeezed out a gain of 38 points, or 0.09%, on Wednesday.
*****
> All three averages are down for the week, with key employment reports looming. On Thursday morning, investors will get to sift through weekly jobless claims data, while the August nonfarm payrolls report is due out Friday.
*****
> The market has appeared to be sensitive to potential growth scares in recent weeks, including Tuesday’s sell-off on the heels of weak manufacturing data. That could put increased importance on the jobless claims data, BMO Wealth Management chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma said on “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “That’s more of a forward-looking indicator. As long as those stay low — people have jobs, people remain confident in the ability to find jobs or comfortable in the jobs that they have — we think that they will continue to spend. So as long as those numbers stay low, if we get some blips in the overall monthly jobs report that shows weakness on the edges, we’re not quite as concerned,” Ma said.
*****
> The employment data could play a key role in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision later this month. Ma said he still believes the U.S. economy is on track for a “soft landing” and that the market rally should eventually broaden out. However, he added that there is likely to be continued market turbulence in the near term.
*****
> “We believe in it, we just think it’s going to be on pause for a few months because this high degree of uncertainty we have right now. There’s just too much that needs to resolved over the coming months. … It’s just very hard for the broadening-of-the-market theme to really gather momentum,” Ma said.

2024-09-04,15:00:41,stocks,[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Reuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.

""Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,"" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. ""There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.""

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is ""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""

Intel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.

Broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.

Some of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.

**CRUCIAL SETBACK**

As part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.

Intel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.

Intel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.

Typically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.

Broadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.

For an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.

TSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.

Moving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.

Betting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.

Intel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.

The company plans to be ""manufacturing-ready"" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers ""actively engaged"" with the tool kit.

2024-09-02,14:02:43,stocks,BYD sales hit a record in August despite broader China EV slowdown ,"Chinese electric car giant BYD sold a record number of passenger vehicles in August, with sales of hybrids growing faster than those of battery-only cars.

The company said August sales rose by 30% year-on-year to 370,854 passenger cars.

Its sales of battery-only cars rose by nearly 12%, while hybrid-powered vehicle sales surged by 48% to account for just under two-thirds of BYD cars sold last month.

In contrast, several new energy vehicle startups saw a dip in deliveries last month.

Li Auto, best known for its range-extender vehicles, reported 48,122 deliveries in August, down from a record 51,000 in July.

Aito, which uses Huawei technology, said it delivered 31,216 cars last month, down by more than 10,000 vehicles from the prior month. Huawei is selling the Aito trademark and patents to automaker Seres for 2.5 billion yuan ($352.5 million).

Lower-priced cars hitting the market

Nio said it delivered 20,176 cars in August, down slightly from July but above 20,000 for a fourth-straight month.

The company’s lower-priced brand Onvo opened 105 stores on Sunday as it prepares to begin for deliveries for its first car, the L60 SUV, this month. Nio is scheduled to report earnings on Friday.

Xpeng reported 14,036 car deliveries in August, its best month for the year so far.

The company said on Friday it began some deliveries of its newly launched, mass market Mona M03 electric car that sells for the equivalent of less than $20,000 in China. It was not clear whether those M03 deliveries were included in the total figure Xpeng reported.

Geely-backed Zeekr reported a month-on-month increase to 18,015 deliveries in August, but that was down from 20,206 deliveries in June.

Undercutting Tesla and going global

Zeekr on Friday said it would launch its first SUV this month with a price more than $1,400 lower than Tesla’s Model Y. The U.S.-listed Chinese company said it aims to deliver the SUV globally by the end of this year, but did not specify which countries or regions.

BYD said it sold 31,451 cars overseas last month, pushing the year-to-date total to 264,869 and above the 242,765 cars it sold abroad for all of last year.

If BYD keeps up its average monthly overseas sales pace through the end of December, the company will sell just under 400,000 cars outside China this year, according to CNBC calculations.

Xiaomi only said it delivered more than 10,000 cars in August for a third-straight month. In mid-July, CEO Lei Jun said the company aimed to deliver 100,000 units of its SU7 electric sedan by the end of November.

That indicates Xiaomi needs to deliver an average of at least 16,000 cars a month from August to November, according to CNBC calculations of reported data.

The smartphone company began mass deliveries of the SU7 in April at a price about $4,000 less than Tesla’s Model 3.

2024-08-31,10:54:12,stocks,I think Alphabet (GOOGL) is the most undervalued stock in the stock market right now,"I am 100% invested in Alphabet due to several reasons. I think we are in a similar situation to Meta when it was faced with law suits, reached 90$ last year and everybody said it would die. 

1. Alphabet is growing in the double digits every year since its inception. Its PE is on the way to below 20 and laughably cheap for a tech company with that growth. 

3. They crushed earnings and the only reason for their slump afterwards was their heavy AI spending, which they can easily cut if they see its not worth it anymore. Also comparable to Meta.

2. Alphabet is a leader in innovative technologies such as autonomous driving. Tesla shot up 40% or something when Elon made another promise towards autonomous driving, while Google actually is the first mover and build up a network with hundred thousands of paying users. 

3. I dont think that AI will be as useful as some still expect. But in no way Google is endangered by that. I dont have more recent numbers, but in July Googles market share in the search business grew slightly, while ChatGPT declined by 12%. I think the summarised answers in Google search are already way more useful and convenient than what Bing or ChatGPT offers. 

4. If AI presents itself as useful Google and Meta will have the best model. People misunderstand how AI works. Its not the model which is important, its the underlying set of data. With the deal it closed with Reddit beginning of 2024, google honestly struck Gold for a really cheap price.

5. Tech companies are literally what keeps the american economy and influence in the world right now alive. I think its not realistic to think that the DOJ will do anything which substancially weakens an american tech company at this point. They will probably get a slap on the wrist in a way of a (big) fine. But priced in is currently a potential break up.

6. Atleast for the next earnings I expect an ad revenue ""short squeeze"" because of the really polarized american election. Way more money will be invested in ads than in previous elections, and while the sum on its own isnt that much, depending on how elastic the ad market is, it will drive up ad space for everyone involved.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

2024-08-28,15:58:06,stocks,Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway hits $1 trillion market value ,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reached a $1 trillion market capitalization on Wednesday, the first non-technology company in the U.S. to score the coveted milestone.

Shares of the Omaha-based conglomerate have rallied more than 27% in 2024, nearly doubling the S&P 500′s return. The $1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ turns 94 years old.

The shares were up 1.2% on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet.

Unlike the six other companies in the trillion dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen. (Although its sizable Apple position has helped drive recent gains.)

Buffett took control of Berkshire, a struggling textile business, in the 1960s and transformed the company into a sprawling empire that encompasses insurance, railroad, retail and energy with an unmatched balance sheet and cash fortress.

Buffett has been in a defensive mode as of late, dumping a massive amount of stock, including half of his Apple stake, while raising Berkshire’s cash pile to a record $277 billion at the end of June.

While Buffett famously never times the market and advises others to not try to either, these recent moves served as a wake-up call to some of his followers on Wall Street, who believe he saw some things he did not like about the economy and market valuation.

Berkshire invests the majority of its cash in short-term Treasury bills, and its holding in such securities — valued at $234.6 billion at the end of the second quarter — has exceeded the amount the U.S. Federal Reserve owns.

High price tag

Berkshire’s original Class A shares carry one of the highest price tags on Wall Street. Today, each one sells for 68% more than the median price of a home in the U.S. 

That’s because Buffett has never split the stock, arguing that the high share price attracts and retains more long-term, quality-oriented investors. The Ben Graham protégé has said that many Berkshire shareholders use their stock as a savings account.

Still, Berkshire issued Class B shares in 1996 at a price equal to one thirtieth of a Class A share to cater to smaller investors wanting a small piece of the Buffett’s performance.

# What could stop the Nvidia frenzy?

# Two contradictions could stymie the AI chipmaker-in-chief

IF today’s stockmarkets have their version of the great wildebeest migration, it is the stampede of the Nvidia bulls. Wall Street is no Serengeti, and Jim Cramer’s high-pitched narration no match for the dulcet tones of Sir David Attenborough. But in other respects investors’ headlong rush into the American chipmaker’s shares has been every bit as enthralling a spectacle.

Galloping sales of Nvidia’s artificial-intelligence (AI) processors have lifted its market capitalisation from $350bn at the start of 2023 to $1trn, then $2trn, and then, this summer, $3trn. In June it overtook Microsoft, an AI-zealous software giant believed to be the biggest buyer of its chips, as [the world’s most valuable firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/06/20/nvidia-is-now-the-worlds-most-valuable-company). It proceeded to lose that title—and $900bn in value—amid the recent stockmarket panic, only to claw back most of its losses in the past few weeks. As the firm prepares to report its latest results on August 28th just about everyone expects another blow-out quarter. “How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?” Mr Cramer asked rhetorically on his CNBC show last week, referring to Nvidia’s boss. These days the Nvidia bear appears to be an endangered species. Or, as Sir David might whisper, “Not an *Ursus nvidiaensis* in sight.”

For every hedge fund that trims its stake in the company, another seems to do the opposite. Of the 74 Wall Street analysts who cover Nvidia and are tracked by Bloomberg, 66 advise buying more of its shares; none suggests selling. Their average price target for the stock one year from now implies a market value of around $3.5trn. James Anderson, a veteran tech investor who was an early backer, teases that Nvidia could be worth $49trn in a decade, a shade more than the total value today of the S&P 500 index of large American firms. All it would take is consistent annual sales growth of 60% at current operating margins of 60% or so, plus some plausible assumptions about cashflow. (Mr Anderson’s current employer, Lingotto, is owned by Exor, the biggest shareholder of *The Economist*’s parent company.)

Investment bankers at Jefferies, Goldman Sachs and UBS project that Nvidia’s yearly revenues will double this year, to over $100bn, grow by as much as half in 2025 and by double digits until at least 2027. By then its operating profit could exceed $150bn—a third more than Apple, tech’s most successful money-spinner, managed last year. The numbers are getting so big, so fast, that this alone should give the bulls pause. As they catch their breath, they might wish to ruminate on two contradictions lurking in Nvidia’s long-term growth story.

The first concerns its main supplier. Nvidia [designs chips](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/02/27/why-do-nvidias-chips-dominate-the-ai-market) but does not produce them. That falls to [TSMC](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/04/11/tsmcs-american-chipmaking-plans-grow-25bn-more-ambitious), a Taiwanese contract chipmaker that dominates the market for the cutting-edge silicon that goes into AI servers. As demand for these has rocketed, Nvidia has gone from one among many of TSMC’s clients to probably its second-biggest behind Apple. If it is indeed “customer B”, one of two that represent at least 10% of TSMC’s revenues and must thus be disclosed in regulatory filings, it spent $7.7bn with TSMC last year, up from $5.5bn two years earlier. Given that most of Nvidia’s purchase commitments of $19bn for 2025 are likely to end up with TSMC, it could soon eclipse the current “customer A”, which handed the Taiwanese firm just shy of $18bn in 2023.

Even as Nvidia’s and TSMC’s fates become more entwined, however, their product cycles are diverging. Earlier this year Mr Huang vowed to launch a new and improved AI chip every year, rather than every couple of years. TSMC is therefore in a mad rush to expand capacity, pledging to invest up to $32bn this year and possibly more in 2025. But it still needs at least 18 months to erect a new factory. And because these can cost $20bn a pop, careful discussions with clients typically start a year or two in advance. It is unclear how Nvidia’s accelerated timeline fits in with TSMC’s more measured pace of decision-making. In an early sign of trouble, Nvidia has delayed shipments of its latest chips, called Blackwell, by a couple of months owing to technical kinks.

Nvidia’s reliance on TSMC also highlights the second tension in the bulls’ case. Because the manufacturer controls the volume and efficiency of production, the only way for Nvidia to ensure that it meets investors’ bullish expectations for sales is to raise prices. A Blackwell chip will cost 20-25% more than the earlier generation, which was twice the price of the one before. Each chip is more powerful than the last, so the cost per unit of computing power is probably declining. But not fast enough for customers.

In August Andy Jassy, chief executive of Amazon, whose cloud-computing arm is a big user of Nvidia chips, acknowledged that he had “heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance”. His company is investing in its own designs. So are Google, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla. [AMD](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/31/could-amd-break-nvidias-chokehold-on-chips), a rival chip-designer, has gone from almost no AI-chip sales in 2022 to a forecast $5bn this year. On August 19th it said it would buy ZT Systems, a server maker, helping it to compete with Nvidia’s end-to-end offering. Chinese tech champions such as Huawei, barred by American sanctions from procuring top-end Nvidia gear, may forge breakthroughs that could do to Nvidia’s market share what Chinese competitors like BYD did to Tesla’s in electric cars.

# Exit pursued by a bear

Assuming a killer app eventually emerges—which it hasn’t yet—generative ai is unlikely to become widely used unless it gets much cheaper; a ChatGPT query can cost seven times more to answer than Google search. Nvidia may soon have to choose between lowering prices to support its growth or maintaining prices to protect its profit margin. For now Nvidia bulls think they can have it both ways.

2024-08-27,13:12:08,stocks,Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he's been dumping the stock because no one wants the company's cars or robots,"* Tesla stock is in a ""quagmire,"" the longtime investor Ross Gerber has said.
* He said he'd sold about $60 million in Tesla shares amid growing concerns over the carmaker.
* Gerber told Yahoo Finance that no one seemed interested in buying Tesla's cars anymore.

  
One of Tesla's longtime investors has dumped about half his stake in Elon Musk's carmaker.



The shareholder, Ross Gerber, has said that's because no one seems interested in buying Tesla's cars or robots.



Gerber, who's been a loud critic of Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, said he had sold about 60 million worth of his Tesla shares. He told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview that his investment fund still had a $50 million stake in the company.



""Over time, I've just been sort of lowering my position, because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals that were set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently, which is really to sell more cars,"" Gerber said, dismissing bullish talk on Tesla's robotics and full-self-driving tech. ""That's just a distraction from the fact that they need to sell cars, this year, and next year, and the year after, because none of this is coming anytime soon,"" he added.



Other Tesla investors have also grown skeptical and impatient over the car company's trajectory. Tesla's stock is down 13% this year, largely because of declining sales, rising competition in China, and drama surrounding Musk's legal battles.



Gerber said the used-car market was swarmed with old Teslas, adding that he'd been unable to offload his own Tesla at what he deemed a fair value.



""It's really a quagmire where you have the best products in an industry but a CEO who doesn't actually work there, who doesn't try to sell the cars,"" Gerber said, adding: ""We've seen sales go down, and that's what's happening. Sales are going down. If you're expecting a great quarter, you're wrong. They're not selling any Teslas here, other than basically, discount, discount, discount.""



And while analysts have made the case that the company is being undervalued as an AI firm, Gerber said artificial intelligence was unlikely to save the company. He speculated that demand would be poor for Tesla's humanoid robots, given doubts over Musk amid his chaotic revamp of Twitter into X.



""The simplest way to do it is, go around to your neighbors and ask them, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' And the answer is zero, OK. Nobody wants a robot from Elon Musk. Why? Who would trust it?"" Gerber said, adding: ""The last thing I need is some robot built by Elon Musk in my house, so I don't know if they thought about the marketing of this at all yet.""



Musk's leadership of Tesla has been under rising scrutiny from investors and lawmakers over the past few years. Most recently, Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board of directors, calling on the executives to ensure Musk was meeting his financial responsibilities to Tesla shareholders.

2024-08-26,08:44:24,stocks,Morgan Stanley is cutting its position in Tesla stock. Here's why,"It seems that Morgan Stanley has finally seen the writing on the wall.

Morgan Stanley said it is slashing its position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, citing a “continued slowdown in the auto industry, intense competition among electric vehicles (EVs) and reduced consumer preferences” for EVs.

TSLA has been a part of Morgan Stanley’s model portfolio since March 2021, with the position increased in both September and December 2022. However, the stock was reduced in November 2023.

Since the last stake boost in December 2022, Tesla has delivered a 15% return, trailing the Russell 1000 Growth Index (RLG) by 46%, Morgan Stanley strategists highlighted.

“While we continue to hold a position in TSLA, due to the optionality of its various nonauto assets, we see an attractive opportunity to reallocate some of the position to other, less-volatile stocks that are not as economically sensitive and may have less pricing pressure,” they wrote.

Despite Tesla’s status as the leading electric vehicle company in the U.S., with potential growth avenues in robotics, AI, and energy storage, the strategists have decided to reduce the position to make room for stocks with higher earnings viability such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).

Earlier this week, the European Union announced that it would reduce planned tariffs on Tesla vehicles imported from China, lowering them from 20.8% to 9%. The EU is also cutting planned import duties for several other electric vehicle manufacturers.

These new tariffs will be in addition to the existing 10% duties already imposed by the EU on battery electric vehicle imports.

In June, the EU indicated it would impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, arguing that these vehicles ""heavily benefit from unfair subsidies"" and present a ""threat of economic injury"" to European EV producers.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-08-25,12:08:48,stocks,AI in advertising - can it justify the cost?,"Here’s a question:
Gen AI costs a lot. It will inevitably change the world, but the question is how much money it will be able to generate.


Back then when internet came and reformed the world, it has opened a completely new market.
Let’s talk big here - advertising.


Of course AI is opening a lot of new markets, but small markets. It is essentially an improvement on the internet. But how will it disrupt the advertising market? 


Population growth is slowing down. Almost everyone has a smartphone now, and almost everyone spends as much time on the internet as they can. Maybe there is growth until gen X gets completely replaced, where really almost everyone will actively use the internet for everything.


My question is at the current status of the world, is it the case of large companies stealing each others share from the market, or there are still parts left from the cake?


In limited people in the world, with limited people left to conquer, everyone having smart phone, watching the maximum amount of ads people tolerate, what’s left to get? The only way I see here is to sell more expensive ads. How can companies keep up with the extreme growth rate we seen in tech so far?


Maybe AI can create even more accurately targeted ads, with extremely high conversion rate, in which case ads can be sold for more, but still there won’t be that much more people to show more ads to. Can the ads performance justify the massive costs of AI, or it’s just the case of every large company burning up their money on AI just to cover their existing shares from the market, in which case I can’t see uptrend there, just a massive bear market.


In any case, I see Meta a very strong player here, the disruption of making LLAMA open source was just brilliant, strong on ads, and one of the earliest players in the ai game.

2024-08-23,03:49:11,stocks,"Roadside Tesla Semi fire where temperatures reached 1,000 degrees draws in NTSB investigative team","A crash and large fire along a California freeway involving an electric Tesla Semi has drawn the attention of federal safety investigators.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it’s sending a team of investigators from the Office of Highway Safety mainly to look into fire risks posed by lithium-ion batteries.

The team will work with the California Highway Patrol to “examine the wreckage and gather details about the events leading up to the collision and the subsequent fire response,” the agency said in a statement.

The Los Angeles Times reported that the Tesla rig was traveling east on Interstate 80 around 3:15 a.m. Monday near Emigrant Gap, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northeast of Sacramento, when it went off the road and collided with trees near the right shoulder.

The battery caught fire, spewing toxic fumes and reaching a temperature of 1,000 degrees, forcing firefighters to wait for it to burn out, the Highway Patrol told the newspaper. The Tesla driver walked away from the crash and was taken to a hospital, and the freeway was temporarily closed.

The battery burned into the late afternoon while firefighters tried to cool it down for cleanup, and the freeway didn’t reopen until 7:20 p.m., authorities said.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the crash and fire from Tesla.

After an investigation that ended in 2021 the NTSB determined that high-voltage electric vehicle battery fires pose risks to first responders and that guidelines from manufacturers about how to deal with them were inadequate.

The agency, which has no enforcement powers and can only make recommendations, called for manufacturers to write vehicle-specific response guides for fighting battery fires and limiting chemical thermal runaway and reignition. The guidelines also should include information on how to safely store vehicles with damaged lithium-ion batteries, the agency said.

Tesla began delivering the electric Semis in December of 2022, more than three years after CEO Elon Musk said his company would start making the trucks. Musk has said the Semi has a range per charge of 500 miles (800 kilometers) when pulling an 82,000-pound (37,000-kilo) load.

2024-08-19,15:12:21,stocks,AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for $4.9 billion in cash and stock,"Advanced Micro Devices on Monday said it plans to acquire server maker ZT Systems for $4.9 billion as the company seeks to expand its portfolio of artificial intelligence chips and hardware and battle Nvidia.

AMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.

The computing requirements for AI have dictated that tech companies string together thousands of chips in clusters to achieve the necessary amount of data crunching horsepower. Stringing together the vast numbers of chips has meant the makeup of whole server systems has become increasingly important, which is why AMD is acquiring ZT Systems.

“AI systems are our number one strategic priority,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an interview with Reuters.

The addition of ZT Systems engineers will allow AMD to more quickly test and roll out its latest AI graphics processing units (GPUs) at the scale cloud computing giants such as Microsoft require, Su said.

“The main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs,” Su said.

AMD plans to break off its server manufacturing business and sell it once the deal closes, as it has no plans to compete with companies such as Super Micro Computer, Su said.

AMD has not yet held talks with potential buyers.

ZT Systems Chief Executive Frank Zhang will join AMD and report to AMD’s data center chief, Forrest Norrod.

The closely held ZT Systems has roughly 2,500 employees of which AMD plans to retain about 1,000 engineers. Currently, ZT Systems generates annual revenue of roughly $10 billion, Su said.

Executives expect the deal to close in the first half of 2025 and expect an additional 12 to 18 months to sell the manufacturing business.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company’s developer conference in March that the one-time chip designer now creates and sells entire data centers, or the individual components needed to build one. This year analysts expect the company to generate $105.9 billion from its data center segment, which includes chips and other AI hardware. Su said last month the company expects to collect roughly $4.5 billion worth of AI chip revenue this year. The company’s customers include Microsoft and Meta Platforms.

AMD expects ZT Systems to contribute to the company’s adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

Stock market was terrible in 2022 so nothing was hot in 2022. I also can't think of any for 2023.

2024-08-14,08:37:45,stocks,The Consumer Recession of 2023-2024 and the Future,"Alright so this going to be a long post so bear with me. I think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. Now you’re probably thinking ok but how? GDP continues to grow, unemployment continues to be stable, and the market is higher than ever right now. I am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory.  

1. Microsoft (MSFT)

Now you’re probably wondering why this is the first company I am bringing up when Microsoft grew revenue and income. Microsoft grew revenue by 10% and net income by 20%. Microsoft does both software and hardware. The software parts of the business like Office, Cloud, and Services increased substantially. However when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. 

Device revenue decreased 20%. These are things like personal computers, accessories, and other electronics that Microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. Gaming revenue decreased by 5% with Xbox hardware sales falling 11%. We are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. People are pulling back on items like PCs and gaming consoles. 

Now you’re probably thinking “yeah random redditor not everybody buys PCs/Xboxs every year. This means nothing.” 

So now we go to our next company. 

2. Apple

Like Microsoft Apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. If you don’t personally use them you know someone who uses their products. If we look at Apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. Hardware sales were down across the board. Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Wearables all declined. However no what didn’t decline? Services. Like Microsoft services grew for Apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. Once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. 

Now you’re probably thinking “yeah random redditor but Apple isn’t cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. So that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things.” Ok let’s keep going. 

3. Nike

Nike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. Like Apple if you don’t use their products you personally know someone who uses them. They’re everywhere. Nike reported a decline in revenue by 2% in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10% drop in Q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. We saw Nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and it’s expected to get worse in 2025. The stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides Covid these levels haven’t been seen since 2018.

Now you’re probably thinking “ok random redditor but Nike isn’t cool anymore and Adidas is better and sells more track suits to the Eastern Europeans. So it makes sense why it’s down.” Ok lets look at more. 

4. Home Depot and Lowe’s

The two home building retailer giants of the US. If you own a home or have done work on your home you’re familiar with these 2 companies. These 2 companies are staples to the entire US economy. Similar to UPS and FedEx if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing you’re paying attention to these two companies as they’re crucial to its health. In 2023 we saw Home Depots sales decrease by 3% and earnings decrease by 9.5%. We just saw Home Depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. We saw a similar result for Lowe’s. They reported a net sales decrease of 11% and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. With expectations being another 2-3% fall in comparable sales. 

Both Home Depot and Lowe’s stock are still down from their highs in 2021. Home Depot is down 16% and Lowe’s down 10% which was close to 3 years ago. 

Now you’re probably thinking “ok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about.” Ok how about another one. 

5. Target 

Target is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. Target is the upperclass Walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies I mention they appeal to the middle/high class. 

In 2023 Target reported a sales decline of 1.7% and a comparable sales decline of 3.7%. Full year revenue decreased by 1.7%. The company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. Target stock is currently down 48% from its high with its high being in 2021. 

I can really keep going with this. Here is some more. 

1. Estee Lauder: massive stock decline

2. Ulta Beauty: massive stock decline

3. UPS (a crucial economic stock): massive stock decline

4. Lululemon: massive stock decline

5. Dollar General: massive stock decline

6. Hershey: massive stock decline 

7. Starbucks: massive stock decline

Now what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about? These are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. Now we are seeing the middle class  consumer pull back on these products. Maybe you’re not buying the next Microsoft PC this year, or the new iPhone, or the new pair of Nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas. This is causing the market to price in future bad results and causing the stock price to crash. 

We are seeing a case where the market is not reflecting the economy. Businesses all across various industries are showing declines across the board and it’s only expected to get worse. Now with all these declines in other industries why is the market so high? The answer is tech. Companies like Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, etc. are dominating the market. With these stocks continuing to increase and other stocks continuing to decrease it’s only getting worse. They have a heavy weight on the indexes and they’re causing most of the gains in the index while we are seeing other sectors decline. 

This has caused tech valuations to soar and other areas of the market to lag. Now what does this mean going forward. Are we due for a massive decline in the market where we see tech finally come down? 

I personally don’t think so. However I think going forward we won’t see the returns that tech has given now going forward. I think these stock declines in the market has presented opportunities and we can possibly see a sector rotation. For example the Fed cutting rates and alleviating pressure on the consumer. A case where tech lags behind and we see other areas of the market which have fallen start to climb. I could be wrong on this but these are just my thoughts. Let me know what you think about this theory.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

2024-08-08,01:30:21,stocks,Possible Bullish Thesis on Hertz,"I know, I know - investors or traders have gotten the shaft on this ticker, but hear me out.

Hertz ran into *more* issues post-covid travel restrictions when Tesla marked down the price of their vehicles and accelerated the depreciation of said assets on Hertz's books (PP&E on balance sheet). There has also been seasonality regarding sales, profitability, and consumer spending is relatively contractionary for the overall sector. Their earnings have obviously been unsatisfactory, and there's been leadership and financial restructuring to *try* get things back on track. IDC about any of that really, what I care about is the strategic mistake to accelerate the sale of their EVs given the low utilization rate of EVs by their customers in the Hertz fleet.

Hertz is positioned to have one of the largest robo-taxi fleets in the world, second to only Tesla themselves to my knowledge, and Tesla can't position fleets everywhere *yet*.

* After Tesla began seriously teasing investors with the idea, companies like Lyft and Uber corrected, hard, while Hertz reached a bottom @ <$3/share with upside volatility characteristics.
* Hertz is trading at well below book value, and the PP&E depreciation will decelerate once Teslas become a profitable investment (i.e., rideshare fees > depreciation & maintenance).
* The low utilization rate by Hertz's customers will be moot if the fleet is automatically participating robo-ridesharing. They will be utilized, at least more so than previous reporting periods.

If Hertz slows or ceases selling their EVs for short term liquidity, once robo-taxi platform rolls out, Hertz has a new revenue stream with their existing assets. The depreciation will slow or reverse, their low utilization rate will subside, and their profitability will increase dramatically.

There's a lot of ***ifs*** in this scenario, but if this happens, I think Hertz will *at least* trade at book value ( > $6.25/share) indicating over 75% upside by the end of this year. If profitability continued to grow from robo-taxi fees, and if Hertz accomplishes higher profitability over the next several years from this while increasing utilization rates, their EPS will go profitable again which if sustainable we're looking at over $10-20/share in the coming years.

What are your thoughts?  
Do you see value in this thesis?  
Do you have a strong counter argument?

Looking forward to your thoughts. Thanks!",TSLA,Tesla
2024-08-07,00:17:52,stocks,Elon Musk’s support for Trump pushes a corporate customer away from Tesla ,"European drugstore giant Rossmann announced Tuesday it will no longer buy Tesla’s electric vehicles for its fleet, effective immediately, citing CEO Elon Musk’s pro-Trump political support.

Rossmann, based in Germany, said in a statement that its decision was “based on the incompatibility between the statements of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the values ​​that Tesla represents with its products.”

“Elon Musk makes no secret of his support for Donald Trump,” Raoul Rossmann, a spokesperson for the company, said in a statement. “Trump has repeatedly described climate change as a hoax - this attitude is in stark contrast to Tesla’s mission to contribute to environmental protection through the production of electric cars.”

While Rossmann only purchases about 180 electric vehicles a year — and only had 38 Teslas in its fleet according to Bloomberg — the company’s decision to cut all Tesla EV purchases shows that Musk’s political decisions have begun to impact the automaker well beyond the U.S.

Musk formally endorsed Trump last month, and said he was contributing funds to a pro-Trump group he helped create called America PAC. Musk is also slated to interview the former president, Trump announced on Tuesday.

During a debate with President Biden in June, former President Trump dodged questions about what he would do, if anything, to combat climate change. And Trump has called climate change a “hoax.” He has also promised to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate agreement, as he did during his presidency, if he is re-elected in November.

According to ongoing research by Morning Consult, Republicans in the U.S. began to view Musk more favorably following his leveraged buyout of Twitter (now known as X) in late 2022. However, this has not driven an increase in Republican’s “purchasing consideration” of electric vehicles here. According to Pew Research, Musk’s reputation with left-leaning voters has declined even though they are far more likely to purchase an EV.

Rossman’s decision follows a recent survey that found a deterioration in Tesla’s brand, attributed partly to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.” While Tesla’s revenue increased 2% during the second quarter, automotive revenue dropped 7% to $19.9 billion from $21.27 billion in the same quarter a year ago.

Tesla opened a factory in 2022 in Brandenburg, Germany (outside of Berlin) and employs thousands in the country. At the end of 2023, the drugstore chain Rossmann reported that it had more than 4,700 stores and more than 60,000 employees with about half in Germany.

Tesla has faced protests by environmental activists in Germany who took issue with the company’s plans to cut down part of a forest and to use water for manufacturing in Brandenburg. Musk lashed out at protesters there, saying on X in March they’re “either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they’re puppets of those who don’t have good environmental goals.”

Tesla, Musk and representatives for Rossmann did not respond to requests for further details on Thursday morning.

2024-08-06,19:09:30,stocks,Uber reports better-than-expected earnings and revenue for second quarter ,"Uber on Tuesday reported second-quarter earnings results that topped Wall Street estimates. The stock rose about 6% at the market open.

Here’s how the company did for the period ending June 30, compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 47 cents vs. 31 cents expected

Revenue:  $10.7 billion vs. $10.57 billion expected

Revenue increased 16% from $9.23 billion a year earlier, Uber said in a press release. The company’s mobility unit reported a 23% increase in gross bookings to $20.6 billion. Gross bookings rose 16% in delivery to $18.1 billion, and were flat in the freight unit at $1.27 billion.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi had said the company expected around 20% growth for the second quarter, based on anticipated continued expansion in its core mobility business, and rising frequency of orders for food and trips through its membership subscribers.

For the third quarter, Uber expects bookings of $40.25 billion to $41.75 billion. The middle of the range, $41 billion, fell shy of the $41.18 billion average estimate, according to StreetAccount. The company expects adjusted earnings of $1.58 billion to $1.68 billion, with the middle of the range just above the $1.62 billion average estimate.

Uber’s “monthly active platform consumers,” or MAPCs, reached 156 million in the second quarter with 2.77 billion trips via the Uber platform. This compares with 137 million MAPCs and 2.28 billion trips during the same period a year ago.

Uber also reported $1.02 billion in net income for the quarter, which included a $333 million pretax benefit from “revaluations of Uber’s equity investments.”

In May, the company announced a partnership with Instacart that would add a “restaurants” tab to the grocery delivery app, enabling its users to order from restaurants and have deliveries fulfilled by Uber Eats.

In July, Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD and Uber announced a partnership to bring around 100,000 EVs to Uber drivers starting in Europe and Latin America. The companies also plan “to collaborate on future BYD autonomous-capable vehicles to be deployed on the Uber platform,” Uber said Tuesday.

While BYD vehicles aren’t sold or available for lease in the U.S., Uber has a range of other incentives and options in place to motivate drivers to use Tesla and other battery-electric vehicles, rather than gas-powered cars.

Analysts on the earnings call asked Khosrowshahi about Uber’s experience with autonomous vehicles, including its partnerships and long-term strategy for the market. Uber and Waymo partner in Arizona to let Uber users book driverless rides and food deliveries as an option.

Khosrowshahi didn’t disclose specifics about Waymo, but said broadly, “AV players” experience much higher utilization with Uber than they do “without a network on a first-party basis.” He said Uber “will continue to have the most liquid and largest marketplace” and that there will be a “pretty long hybrid period as autonomous is developing and regulators are trying to figure out exactly how to regulate it.”

“We don’t think this will be a winner take all market,” Khosrowshahi said.

Uber shares were down 5% for the year as of Monday’s close, but are now up slightly after Tuesday’s rally.

2024-08-06,11:10:07,stocks,What's the deal with German automakers being so undervalued?,"German car companies like Mercedes, BMW, Porsche being valued at under 50 billion with P/E of around 5 seems massively illogical. Musk paid 44 billion for Twitter. Porsche's market cap is 30 billion. You could not even buy all the Porsches that are produced in a single year for 30 billion (roundabout 300k cars times 120k average price = 36 billion) let alone come anywhere close to buying the company. 

So how does it make sense that in theory, owning 51 % of the shares, which equals only about 15 billion worth right now, makes you the owner of the Porsche company? Of course this is in theory because you cannot just go and buy 51 % of the shares but you get the point.

As reference, Intel currently is still valued 4 times as much as Porsche and twice as much as Mercedes while basically being a company on lifeline supported by tax money while Mercedes released the first approved level 3 self-driving car (ahead of Tesla) so these companies aren't just sleeping on new tech and living off of past glory like Intel to be valued only around or under the 50 billion mark.

Agencies and staff reporter

Nvidia said it was on track to ramp up production of its most advanced artificial intelligence chip, following reports of a delay in its launch due to design flaws.

Tech journal The Information had reported that design flaws on its new Blackwell chip could cause a delay of three months or more and the setback could affect customers such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft, which have collectively ordered tens of billions of US dollars' worth of chips.

The chip giant's Blackwell series succeeds its earlier flagship AI chip, the Grace Hopper Superchip.

In response, a Nvidia spokesman said ""Hopper demand is very strong, broad Blackwell sampling has started, and production is on track to ramp in the second half.""",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2024-08-04,18:52:31,stocks,My thoughts on META,"**I'd like to start a dialogue on what investors think about META - please challenge or add onto this discussion. This is a long post, so I've posted the TLDR below.**

Given the recent negative non-farm jobs report and unemployment prints, I think the market is missing a great opportunity in META stock after a great earnings report.

Context: META pre-earnings was about $470 and post earnings is now $488. They beat earnings by 8%. META is down from its high of $540.

Position: I have sold some META puts at lower strike points, so yes I am biased and want the company to perform well, but will change my mind if there's a compelling argument otherwise.

**First thoughts on the market:**

The sell-off is a correction that gives long term investors an opportunity to buy companies at a less inflated P/E ratio. I think recession concerns are overblown given the following:

* Absolute levels of unemployment remain very low
* Meeting inflation targets are important for encouraging discretionary spending for lower income populations so that buying power won't be continuously eroded and we can move past this tightening cycle
* The Fed has the ability to reduce interest rates significantly if warranted
* Reduction in mortgage rates will allow: (1) existing homeowners to reduce interest burden and increase discretionary spending and (2) stimulate big ticket purchases (e.g. cars, homes, etc.)
* Reduced bond yields means equities become more attractive in comparison. In the short run, the carry trade has largely unwinded from its highs in July 2024 and further downside risk is less than before - [see chart here from ING](https://think.ing.com/articles/jpy-peeling-back-the-carry-trade-onion/).

**META specific thoughts:**

* **Earnings:**
   * Just crushed earnings expectations, their advertising business continues to run strong with user base growth. They stated that they have seen early benefits from their CAPEX spend on AI (not sure if it reaches desired ROI yet however).
* **Reasonable valuation in the short run:**
   * Currently trading at \~25 PE (TTM) and forward PE is \~21 to 24 depending on EPS forecasts. [Source linked here](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/meta/forecast/). For context, Meta hit its lowest PE of 14 in December 2022 when people thought Meta wouldn't exist anymore due to ad spend concerns, apple privacy updates, and issues with facebook engagement.
   * Compared to other tech companies investing in AI, Meta (along with Google) has one of the lowest P/Es with a comparable growth rate. Relative to its peers, its PEG ratio is lower as well. However, I think some of this difference is explained by its reliance on ad spend which is cyclical and less resilient in downturns.
* **Long term bets:**
   * Meta has invested in long term bets in AI and Virtual reality which have yet to pay off and are considered a cost burden.
   * For example, in their recent earnings call, they've talked about using AI stand-in personas to help influencers and small businesses answer questions to followers. If they become the ""small business or personal"" AI, then they can deepen relationships with users and monetize in ways beyond ads through reoccuring services revenue. Reoccuring revenue and proving monetization of AI will give it a boost in EPS given investors value this type of revenue more.
   * I believe Meta is trying to move away from reliance on ads and provide value to users in ways that cannot be pulled away as easily (similar to other SaaS companies)
* **Spending Risks:**
   * CAPEX is large which has a future drag on EPS, but I think they can scrap their VR initiatives if needed if cost efficiency is required.
   * If AI doesn't work out, EPS growth will be harmed in the outer years (assuming near term growth is not expected to be fueled by AI).
* **Economic Risks:**
   * Short term dependence on ad spend which is cylical and impacted during recessions
   * Chinese companies spending a lot on Meta for ads - this might go away
   * I think given interest rates are coming down - hopefully any softness will be alleviated quickly.

**TLDR:** Short term business is reasonably valued and forward valuations aren't priced for explosive AI monetization. This results in upside both from an EPS and P/E perspective if there is no prolonged economic downturn and especially if new AI products show early chutes of monetization. Would appreciate any thoughts/challenges to this from other investors.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

> “You even see some analysts describing it as **a breakthrough akin to the original iPhone.”**

> “Let me be clear: At this point, Apple Intelligence isn’t that.”

> Now, it’s true that this is just the first beta release and the company will undoubtedly improve it over the next few months. But I suspect that we’re seeing a fairly good picture of what Apple Intelligence will look like when it debuts around October. 

> “I found the ability to summarize emails to be useful: It provided an excellent distillation of the message’s content. This is particularly a perk for message previews, which typically just show the first few lines of an email. But the summaries of text message conversations — particularly for fast-moving group chats — were a disappointment and mostly useless. Summaries are also helpful in Safari for articles, but I don’t foresee that being a particularly popular feature. “

> “The most impressive features so far are Writing Tools, Type to Siri and phone-call recording summaries. The Writing Tools are essentially a well-integrated version of Grammarly-style features. It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that’s been available on Android phones for a while now.”

It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that’s been available on Android phones for a while now.”

> “I was less impressed with the reply suggestions in Messages, which don’t immediately seem like a major upgrade over the existing keyboard suggestions in iOS. They could be a lot more thoughtful, perhaps by better using the context of the chat so far, rather than just the last message in the thread.”

> “The best feature is the ability to record a phone call and get a transcript of the conversation as well as a summary of what took place. In my tests, this has worked almost flawlessly, and the summaries have been excellent. It’s certainly a nice time saver.”

> “Type to Siri is also a nice upgrade, as is the new visual cue that Siri is active on the iPhone, iPad and CarPlay. But neither of those interface improvements has anything to do with AI.”

> “In any case, these are mainly niceties, not necessities.”

> “There is nothing so compelling yet that would make an iPhone 14 Pro user upgrade to an iPhone 16 just for Apple Intelligence.”

> “Some key Apple Intelligence features aren’t in the initial beta. [Such as AI PHOTO APP and OS-INTEGRATED CHATGPT.] These latter capabilities will likely come in November or December. 

> “Users will have to wait until 2025 to see the fully revamped Siri.”

> “But even when [these delayed features of] Apple Intelligence [are] available, the company will still be playing catch-up. Alphabet Inc.’s Google is miles ahead of Apple in applying AI to photos.”

2024-08-03,12:35:42,stocks,Negative sentiment around the car industry,"The car industry is a notoriously difficult one to invest in. Highly cyclical, very competitive, and very very capital intensive. Right now consumer sentiment seems at the lowest point in the decade.

Everytime I lookat a new car model, people complain that the company has lost its way, their new cars sucks, are too expemsive and people brag about their 15 years old car with 200 miles on it.

I am not a car enthusiast but I understand that higher prices and interest rates take a toll on people. But I think at the end they will have to comply with the new industry standards, and the brands still a bit od differentiation allowing companies to charge some margins (car aren't a commodity yet).

This is good news for many legacy cars companies. People have to change cars at some point and the competition isn't doing great either. Even if there is a risk of a price war, I think it's not too great, and many company will retain their margins in the long run. I am sitting on the sidelines for now, but if prices keep falling I might start building a position.

Some may consider EVs as the Levant in the room. But at least with Tesla, EV sales are struggling as much as ICE ones or more. As for China, I think tarrifs will do a great job at hurting consumers and protecting western automakers.

I was doing some reflecting, looking at my portfolio that I have slowly been building since July / Aug of 2021. I have mostly been doing stock picking based on companies I liked, and unfortunately I have come to the realization that I have missed out on quite a bit of gains from not simply investing in VOO or SPY. My total return on three years of investing is 25% (although last week it peaked at 39%, which probably goes to show that I am over exposed), but had I just put my money in VOO in a dollar cost averaging method, I would likely have a much higher return.

Any advice for me? Should I just sell things off and put them in VOO? My current portfolio breakdown looks like this. Of course some bigger losers I have sold off. *$7934 invested, $9950 current.*

2024-08-01,20:13:46,stocks,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

2024-08-01,06:52:55,stocks,CNBC: Meta’s advertising growth is proof that hefty AI spending is already paying off,"This is a pretty long article, but I think it is an important read since it answers the key question ""Is anyone making significant money from AI right now?"" Clearly the answer is yes for Meta. 

For easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically.

Source: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html)

For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present.

After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business.

“The ways that it’s **improving recommendations and helping people find better content**, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think **there’s a lot of upside there**,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already **products that are at scale**. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.”

Meta reported revenue growth of **22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion**, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet
 said in its earnings report last week.

Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports.

As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region.

Zuckerberg pointed to **AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform**, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet.

“They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and **generated a lot more user engagement because of AI**,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s **showing up in the revenue and the profits now**,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares.

Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter.

Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is **spending billions of dollars** on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future.

‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is **reaping rewards today**.

“You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said.

Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “**clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely**.”

Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “**nicely outpacing those of its peers**.”

**Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI** and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “**significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research** and our product development efforts.”

For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of **$37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion**.

Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.”

Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to **open up new revenue opportunities over time** that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2024-08-01,01:02:59,stocks,"Nasdaq, S&P 500 post best day since Feb after Powell signals possible rate cut in Sept","The three major U.S. averages on Wednesday ended solidly higher, after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate cut ""could be on the table as soon as September"" if data on inflation and the labor market continued to improve.
Powell's remarks, along with a powerful rebound in chip stocks, helped the Nasdaq Composite (COMP:IND) and the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) post their best intraday gain each since February 22.


The Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.64% to settle at 17,599.40 points, while the S&P 500 closed out the final day of the month with an advance of 1.58% to 5,522.30 points. The blue-chip Dow (DJI) added 0.24% to conclude at 40,843.06 points.


U.S. Treasury yields moved lower after Powell's comments, as traders snapped up bonds. The longer-end 10-year yield (US10Y) fell to its lowest level since March, dropping 7 basis points to 4.032%.

Earlier, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held the federal funds rate steady at 5.25%-5.50%, a largely given outcome.


The attention was on Powell's post-decision press conference, amid hopes that the central bank chief would talk about interest rate cuts in September. And Powell did not disappoint.


He signaled that policymakers could be considering an interest rate cut as soon as September if they continued to see inflation moving quickly or in line with their expectations, growth remaining reasonably strong and the labor market staying consistent with its current conditions.


According to the CME FedWatch tool, the odds of a 50 basis point rate cut in September climbed after Powell's comments, underscoring the market's confidence that the monetary policy easing cycle was imminent. There is now a 90.5% chance of a 25 bp cut, a 9.5% chance of a 50 bp cut, and a 0.0% chance of a 0 bp cut.

Nvidia (NVDA) surged 17%, after Morgan Stanley re-added the chip giant to its top picks list following the stock's recent selloff. In addition, Microsoft and Meta reiterated and increased their capital expenditure investments, signaling further revenue upside for Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) climbed 4%, after the world's second-largest maker of personal computer processors issued current quarter revenue guidance that was above consensus estimates.

Microsoft (MSFT) slipped 1%, after the tech behemoth's cloud business missed on revenue and its quarterly capital expenditure swelled to $19B.


Turning to Wednesday's economic calendar, ADP's jobs report before the opening bell showed private sector employment growing by 122K in July, significantly lower than the consensus figure of 154K. Shortly after, a key gauge of Q2 U.S. labor costs rose lesser than anticipated while also slowing down from the previous quarter.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2024-07-31,22:14:03,stocks,Qualcomm beats estimates and phone chip sales are up 12% ,"Qualcomm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations, particularly for sales, and provided strong guidance for the current quarter.

Qualcomm stock rose over 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how Qualcomm did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending in June 23:

Earnings per share: $2.33, adjusted versus $2.25 expected

Revenue: $9.39 billion, adjusted, versus $9.22 billion expected

Net income during the quarter was $2.13 billion, or $1.88 per share, versus $1.8 billion, or $1.60 per share in the year-ago period.

Qualcomm said it expected between $9.5 billion and $10.3 billion in sales in the current quarter, compared to Wall Street expectations of $9.71 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings guidance of $2.45, versus the company’s forecast of between $2.38 and $2.58.

Qualcomm’s biggest and most important business is processors and modems for smartphones, which it calls its handsets business. The summer months are traditionally a slower part of the annual cycle for smartphones, because most new models launch in the fall.

Handset sales rose 12% on a year-over-year basis to $5.9 billion in revenue, in line with analyst estimates from StreetAccount, which suggests that a deep slump in smartphone sales over the past two years is abating. Qualcomm is also framing its most advanced Snapdragon chips as necessary for “AI smartphones,” such as recent Samsung models, which can run some generative AI tasks like creating images.

Automotive chips remains small for Qualcomm but the company sees placing more software and semiconductors into cars as one of its strongest opportunities for growth and diversification. Automotive revenues rose 87% on an annual basis to $811 million. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were looking for $641.7 million.

The company sells chips for lower-cost devices as well as Meta’s Quest headsets in a business it calls “Internet of Things.” The line also includes revenues from the company’s new PC chip for Windows laptops, called Snapdragon X Elite, which it launched alongside Microsoft during the quarter.

CEO Cristiano Amon hailed the Snapdragon X launch as a “milestone” in Qualcomm’s efforts to diversify. Still, Qualcomm said IoT revenue fell 8% on an annual basis to $1.4 billion, which beat StreetAccount expectations of $641.7 million.

Those three hardware lines are reported together as QCT, the company’s chip business, which in total reported $8.1 billion in sales, up 12% year-over-year.

Qualcomm also collects licensing fees from companies that integrate 5G or other cellular technologies into their products, reported as QTL sales. Licensing revenue only rose 3% on an annual basis to $1.3 billion.

Qualcomm said it paid $949 million in dividends and repurchased 7 million shares of stock for $1.3 billion during the quarter.

Here are the results:

Earnings: $5.16 a share vs. $4.73 per share expected by LSEG

Revenue: $39.07 billion vs. $38.31 billion expected by LSEG

Meta provided revenue guidance for the third quarter between the range of $38.5 billion to $41 billion. Analysts were expecting third-quarter sales guidance of $39.1 billion.

The social networking giant reported second-quarter revenue growth of 22% from $32 billion a year earlier, marking a fourth straight quarter of growth in excess of 20%.

Meta said that expenses in the second quarter was $24.2 billion, and that these expenses include the charge from Meta’s recent agreement to settle a facial recognition data lawsuit by the state of Texas for $1.4 billion.

The company reported capital expenditures of $8.47 billion for the second quarter, which was lower than the $9.51 billion that analysts estimated.

Regarding Meta’s outlook for expenses, the company said that total expenses for the year remain unchanged at $96 billion to $99 billion. Capital expenditures are up from the low range to $37 billion to $40 billion compared to $35 billion to $40 billion.

Last quarter, Carvana reported insane numbers, including a GPU of $6,432, which was a 50% increase year over year. We have since learned that Carvana bought a large number of Teslas from Hertz when they went bankrupt at steep discounts. This egregiously elevated their numbers to a severely unsustainable level. 

  
**BEAR THESIS:** 

* The co-founder and CEO sold 1,590,000 shares in July alone. This does not include the millions of shares he sold in 2024. 
* Carvana has $3,000,000,000 (yes, 3 billion) in debt that it pays 10.25% to service every year.

Revenue will be roughly $6.7 billion in the third quarter, the chipmaker said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts estimated $6.62 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The outlook suggests that AMD is making headway in its pursuit of Nvidia Corp., which dominates the market for so-called AI accelerators — chips used to develop artificial intelligence models. Nvidia has capitalized on booming demand to send its shares and stock price soaring over the past year, becoming the world’s most valuable chipmaker in the process. Now AMD is looking to make inroads with its own lineup, called MI300.

AMD is Nvidia’s nearest rival in the market, but still trailing by a wide margin. The hope is to gain more of the money that data-center operators such as Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are pouring into the creation of AI tools.

AMD shares rose about 2% in extended trading following the announcement. They had earlier closed at $138.44 in New York, leaving them down 6.1% for the year.

AMD’s quarterly report kicks off a week of earnings updates from large semiconductor makers. Qualcomm Inc., Arm Holdings Plc and Intel Corp. all report numbers this week, and it comes at a delicate time for the chip industry. Investors have been selling shares of the companies after a dramatic run-up earlier this year.

2024-07-26,06:23:57,stocks,Tech stocks fall in US and Asia as AI shares decline,"The US and Asian stock markets have dropped sharply as buyers sell off their shares in tech companies. Stocks in artificial intelligence (AI) companies have been hit the hardest.

Both the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell the most in one day since 2022. This happened in New York on Wednesday. It went down by 1.2% on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Companies like Nvidia, Apple, Google, Tesla, Microsoft, and Alphabet were the ones that lost the most money. The Nikkei average in Japan fell more than 3% on Thursday, the most in all of Asia.

Most of this year’s stock market gains have come from shares in tech companies, especially those that work with AI. One of the biggest winners in the AI boom has been Nvidia, a company whose shares fell 6.8%. This item has lost around 15% of its value in the past two weeks.

Chipmakers Renesas Electronics and Tokyo Electron as well as SK Hynix in South Korea, were some of the worst hit in Asia. There were also big surprises in the US presidential race and in when the US central bank cut interest rates, which has made investors wary.

But IBM was able to satisfy investors AND, more importantly, is said part of its success was AI. Given the short memory I attribute to investors, I think that they will be happy to revert their hedges today, or at least pause it until Microsoft's report next week. Unlike Alphabet, Code Pilot is a very popular tool, so I expect Microsoft to please investors and give them lollipops and confidence in AI as a money printer.

Reliability (a proxy for product quality) is mid-tier. Their R&D projects are missing schedules for a while, and has no substance. 

Even though there aren't much positive indicators around the stock for a while now, why do they have such a high P/E ratio (60 as of this post)? What is the justification?

A typical response may be ""because Elon is a good liar"" or some anti-Elon emotional take, but I refuse to believe that such a superficial factor can support such a high P/E ratio. The average P/E ratio of other top car manufacturers is around 18. I can believe it if the Elon factor pushes it up to around 30, but 60 is just ridiculous.

2024-07-24,22:16:13,stocks,Tesla shares close down 12% after earnings miss for biggest slump since 2020 ,"Tesla shares plummeted the most since 2020 after the electric vehicle maker reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and another drop in automotive revenue.

The stock closed down 12% on Wednesday at $215.99. It’s now down 13% for the year, while the Nasdaq is up 16% over that stretch.

Tesla on Tuesday said auto revenue declined 7% from a year earlier to $19.9 billion while margins also fell. Total revenue increased 2% to $25.5 billion.

The company has been forced to slash prices globally and offer discounts and incentives as it faces slowing sales and rising competition, especially in China.

Tesla remains the top seller of electric vehicles in the U.S. by far, but is losing market share to a growing number of rivals due in part to its aging lineup of sedans and SUVs and the impact of Musk’s incendiary and political commentary.

Adjusted earnings of 52 cents a share for the second quarter trailed the average analyst estimate of 62 cents, according to LSEG. And Tesla’s adjusted operating margin shrank to the lowest in three years, dropping to 14.4% from 18.7% a year earlier. It’s the fourth straight quarter of shrinkage.

Investors have been focused on a number of other areas around the Tesla story, including when the company will introduce a new mass-market car to reinvigorate its lineup of vehicles. Musk said on the earnings call Tuesday that Tesla is on track to deliver a new “affordable” car in the first half of next year.

Robotaxis were a big topic on the earnings call. Musk envisions a world in which owners can authorize their Tesla vehicle to be used as part of an Uber-style ride-hailing service, with the cars driving autonomously.

When asked when he expects the first robotaxi ride, Musk said, “I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.”

Musk has a history of promising things on a particular timeline and not delivering. On Tuesday, he pushed back the date of the company’s robotaxi event to October, after previously saying it would take place in August.

“This is because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle,” Musk said, adding that Tesla is “going to show up a couple of other things.” He didn’t provide details.

2024-07-24,02:09:17,stocks,Alphabet to invest $5 billion in self-driving car unit Waymo ,"Alphabet is again investing in its self-driving car unit Waymo — this time with $5 billion.

“This new round of funding will enable Waymo to continue to build the world’s leading autonomous driving company,” Alphabet’s outgoing finance chief Ruth Porat said Tuesday on the company’s second-quarter earnings call, adding Waymo is an “important example” of Alphabet’s long-standing investments.

Porat announced the “multiyear” investment on the call and said more information would be available in the company’s quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing, expected on Wednesday. 

Alphabet’s “Other Bets” unit, which includes Waymo, delivered $365 million in quarterly revenue, up from $285 million a year ago. But the unit’s losses widened to $1.13 billion from $813 million in the year-earlier period.

CEO Sundar Pichai said on the earnings call that Waymo provides 50,000 weekly paid trips, primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix. It has completed 2 million trips to date. In June, Waymo removed the waitlist and opened Waymo rides to all San Francisco users.

The unit raised $2.25 billion in its first external funding round in 2020. The company raised another $2.5 billion in 2021 in a round that included funding from Andreessen Horowitz, AutoNation, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity Management & Research Company and more.

Alphabet’s increased investment in Waymo comes after General Motors’ autonomous vehicle unit Cruise said it would indefinitely delay the production of the Origin, a self-driving shuttle designed for use in cities. Tesla on Tuesday delayed plans to unveil its CyberCab, a dedicated robotaxi, from August to Oct. 10.

“Alphabet has committed up to $5B to Waymo,” Waymo CEO Tekedra Mawakana said on X. “We are grateful for their immense vote of confidence in our team and recognizing the amazing progress we’ve made with our technology, product, and commercialization efforts.”

2024-07-23,21:30:29,stocks,Deep dive into Match Group ($MTCH),"**1.0 Introduction**

Match Group is a company that continues to benefit from the (sad) society in which we live. 

The best way to introduce it is by sharing the apps/brands it owns:

***- Tinder, Hinge, Match, Meetic, Plenty of Fish, Pairs, Azar, Hakuna, and many more.***

The estimate is, it has \~**50% market** share in the U.S. and impressive profitability.

Here's its revenue and operating margin over time:

2019: $2.1b (32% operating margin)

2020: $2.4b (31% operating margin)

2021: $3.0b (29% operating margin)

2022: $3.2b (26% operating margin)

2023: $3.4b (27% operating margin)

  
There are two key points:

**1. This is a resilient business** - Regardless if there's a pandemic or inflation, there is always demand for connecting with another human being(s).

**2. The operating margin has decreased** - At first glance, this might seem concerning, and you might wonder: Is this a trend?

The lower margin is caused by the management's decision to increase the R&D expense significantly (it was **7% of revenue** back in 2019, to **11%** in 2023). This is expected to generate value in the future by introducing new products, or new features as part of the existing products. However, it is clear that the ***the current margin decrease is the outcome of a conscious management decision, and is not caused by outside pressure.***

If the additional R&D expense isn't adding value, the management will reverse it, which will bring its old profitability back. With this in mind, I don't see any reason why the operating profitability would further decrease.

  


**2.0 The Worrisome Society**

**2.1** The world is changing and the internet has a significant impact on how couples meet. Based on a survey, more than 50% of the couples (in the U.S.) have met online. This number has doubled over the last decade, meaning **the number of dating app users has increased**. This doesn't come as a surprise, but given that the younger generations are tech-savvy, I don't think we've reached the peak (yet).

**2.2** Not only that, but the new generations are **using more apps**. Based on Match Group's investor presentation back in January 2023, The average number of apps used by individuals under 35 was **4.3** (vs. 3.8 for the average of all groups combined). I would not be surprised if this widens further.

**2.3** Lastly, there are fewer marriages, meaning the apps are being used for a **longer period of time**.

To summarize, we have **more users**, using **more dating apps**, and **for much longer**.



  
**3.0 The Biggest Concern - Competition**

Of course, every company (and industry) has competition. Given the market share, it seems as if Match Group is winning this battle, by a wide margin. Being the biggest fish in the sea, it can create the biggest network effect. The more people use an app, the higher the value it generates for its users.

The biggest concern that many have is - Meta. As Facebook and Instagram are dominating worldwide, in theory, these apps should be able to capture a large portion of the market, quickly. However, the reality is different:

1. ***Facebook Dating*** was launched back in 2019 and it hasn't been a huge success.
2. Facebook was founded back in **2004**. It has been two decades and Mark Zuckerberg has now focused on the Metaverse.

It is quite clear that targeting this market isn’t a priority for Meta at this very moment. It doesn’t mean it will never be, but the chances seem quite slim.



**4.0 Valuation**

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is \~$14 billion **($39/share)** - slightly above the current share price of $34.

The two key assumptions I have are:

1. **Revenue growth of 54% over the next decade** - I think this is fairly conservative. The change in demographics, combined with price increases makes this easily achievable.

2. **Operating margin of 26%** - This is below their historical average and assumes the management continues with the current level of R&D.



Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine, regarding the revenue growth over the next decade, and the operating margin:

|Revenue / Operating margin|26%|28%|30%|CAGR|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|54% ($5.3b)|$39|$43|$47|**4.4%**|
|75% ($6.0b)|$44|$49|$54|**5.8%**|
|100% ($6.9b)|$51|$56|$61|**7.2%**|

As I'm writing this, the share price is $34.

- If the company grows its revenue at \~4% CAGR, the market expects its profitability to decrease below 26%.

- If the profitability remains at 26%, the market expects the revenue to grow below \~4%/year.



Based on the analysis above, I don’t see data that supports any of the two scenarios above.

2025-01-30,02:59:11,investing,Elon indicating battery production issues in earnings call today. Could possible acquisition be a solution for Tesla?,"TO ALL MY HIGH RISK SPECULATIVE INVESTORS!

I know some of you have probably heard about this juicy rumor floating around that Tesla might be looking at acquiring $QS and if you haven't, well its out there and Elon just stated the reason why on todays earnings call.

Elon said - ""Right now, the constraint we're trying to solve is battery production, rather than demand."" So you know they're sweating bullets over their battery issues, working overtime to fix this shit.

Now, the issue is that Elon Musk has historically been content with lithium-ion batteries for Tesla's vehicles, citing the cost implications of adopting solid-state technology at scale. So in order for this rumor to come true and for QS to send us regards (myself included) to the multi-millionaire club, QS must be able to have a revolutionary solid-state Lithium battery AND be able to show that these batteries can be mass-produced cheaply at a large scale.

Just to be crystal clear: THIS IS A SUPER HIGH RISK play because there is a chance that $QS won't be able to figure out how to make these batteries affordable. As always, do your DD before you buy. 

Volkswagen has already made significant investments into $QS, but who the tf wants to drive an electric VW loaded with top-of-the-line revolutionary batteries anyways?

2025-01-27,16:28:40,investing,Third Coast Bancshares: Continued Growth In A Booming Region,"I have been covering numerous small & mid cap banks for quite some time now and I am bullish on the continued growth of many names. TCBX is based in the high-growth Texas metropolitan areas with very impressive growth despite the fact Texas has more banks than any other state. Here is my analysis on this particular community bank:

Hope to hear from everyone on their thoughts on this company / the future outlook on financials

# Macro Overview:

* **Economic Strength of Texas:** Third Coast operates in Texas, whom remain one of the fastest-growing states in the U.S. that recently [grew at 4.2% in Q3 2024](https://gov.texas.gov/business/page/texas-economic-snapshot#:~:text=(Texas%20Comptroller%20of%20Public%20Accounts,U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis)), faster than the nation as a whole. Business friendly policies like no state income tax, have helped corporate relocation's like Tesla, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard. Texas's economy is the [eighth-largest](https://gov.texas.gov/business/page/texas-economic-snapshot#:~:text=(Texas%20Comptroller%20of%20Public%20Accounts,U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis)) when compared to nations of the world and is now valued at $2.6 trillion. Texas is expected to continue to grow and with that the need for lending capabilities should favor Third Coast.
* **Impact of Potential Deregulation:** [Deregulation is expected to play a pivotal role](https://www.thebanker.com/content/05e97cf7-7d6a-580d-91cb-d27cd4d03092) in the new administrations economic agenda. For community banks like Third Coast, this will allow them the ability to operate more freely with relaxed capital requirements. With fewer regulatory requirements, Third Coast can selectively increase their exposure to higher yielding loans and potential acquisitions. Typically, the ability to freely lend boosts bank earnings and growth. It allows the industry the flexibility to regulate themselves. With deregulation almost certain, focusing on further risk-taking is important. This approach may lead to increases in nonperforming loans down the line.

# Investment Thesis:

* **Presence In A High-Growth Region:** Texas has one of the strongest economies in the U.S. consistently outpacing the national GDP growth rate. Third Coast has shown a great track record of impressive growth with a CAGR of over 25% and EPS growth of over 18% from 2020 to 2024. Deregulation in the banking industry is all but certain in the coming months. This will lead to increased lending capabilities that will fuel additional growth in a region that continues to outperform. Third Coast's lending increased 9% to $3.97 billion. Urban centers like Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Houston are hubs for technology, energy, and manufacturing. In particular, residential construction is anticipated to rebound in 2025 fueled by increased populations, jobs, and incomes.
* **Current Valuation:** Third Coast has a P/E (TTM) of 14.65, slightly below the [industry average of 14.8](https://simplywall.st/markets/us/financials/banks). Yet, the stock has risen over 93% in the last year alone and is just -2.5% from its 52-week high of $37.65. Despite the significant increase, Third Coast is still slightly undervalued. It is significantly under their five-year average high P/E of 16.9. With continued growth expected in the long-term, we believe it is best to either wait for a potential pullback, or continue holding.
* **Strong Financial Results:** Fierce competition in Texas is intense with hundreds of banks. Nevertheless, Third Coast has achieved impressive results since their 2021 IPO. Revenue has increased 80%, EPS 194%, and net income 317%. Profitability metrics like return on average assets, return on average equity, and net profit margin have set new records. They have hit highs of 1.05%, 11.48%, and 27.82%, respectively. Nonperforming assets did however increase by 48.7% to 0.58% of total assets. While increases are not desired, the total is still significantly under the industry average indicating proper risk management for now.

# Loan Growth & Quality

* **Nonperforming loans:** Often, solid loan growth comes with risky lending practices. Third Coast predominately lends to CRE and C&I, combined accounting for almost 60% of the total portfolio. Nonperforming loans increased by 61.4% to $27.95 million. A large reason for such a major increase stemmed from C&I accounting for over 51% of nonperforming loans. Non-farm non-residential owner occupied loans accounted for 39%. Fortunately, non-farm non-residential owner occupied loans decreased -14% despite their 11.3% weighting.
* **Nonperforming assets:** Unsurprisingly, nonperforming assets increased by 48.7% as a result. Currently, nonperforming assets are only at 0.58% which is still minor for a community bank. We do not want to see a continuation of nonperforming assets. They can easily start to wipe out a bank's equity. Third Coast has grown fantastically, as has nonperforming loans and assets. Both are now at all-time highs for the banks. We will be monitoring this development in the upcoming quarters to ensure this does not rapidly continue.

# Earnings Overview

* **Revenue:** Fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 16% to $171.38 million. Third Coast benefited from a 15.2% increase in net-interest income due to elevated interest rates. This allowed the bank to reprice loans at higher yields. Floating-rate loans especially boosted interest income, despite rising deposit costs. Total non-interest income also saw impressive growth of 29.4% to $10.62 million contributing to the overall increase in revenue.
* **Net Income:** An impressive increase of 42.7% lead to a total of $47.67 million. This increase was primarily the result of increased net interest income, resulting from loan growth.
* **EPS:** Earnings per share saw strength with growth of 40.4% to $2.78. Higher revenue, controlled cost management, and rising profitability were the primarily reasons for such an increase.",TSLA,Tesla

2025-01-21,15:17:44,investing,Meta: this sub seems dead and I think both users and mods are at fault,"This will most likely get removed as well. But as a long time contributor on this sub I want to vent a little.

What’s the purpose of this sub? The mod team says we shouldn’t post financial news by itself since they are “low effort posts”, so they are encouraging personal opinions being shared.

But then you have people just asking simple questions, and most of the answers are “just buy index funds” regardless of what the questions are.

Any long-form opinions are either met with dismissive “you have no idea what you are talking about, just by $VOO” or no response at all. 

So we can’t post financial news by themselves, and this isn’t the sub for single stock discussions, and any generic investment discussion just leads to “buy index funds”.

Btw mods, I understand that you guys don’t want “low-effort posts”, but if a post received 300+ upvotes and 200 comments within 3 hours (and many of those comments had efforts put into them), maybe it’s ok to leave it up? It’s not like the front page is full anyway. It’s frustrating to see a thread heating up only for you guys to remove the entire thing. 

Edit: Honestly I’ll just say it: I think the mods are more at fault because their vision of a high quality, high engagement discussion forum with high barrier of entry is simply not achievable on a platform like Reddit without making the sub semi-private with individual vetting process, which takes a ton of work that I’m not sure the mods are willing to spend time on.

I’ve been a mod on a couple super large subs and i fully understand how difficult and thankless the job can be. But my philosophy is that moderators of large subs should be the caretakers instead of gatekeepers.

Here's the dilemma I face. I firmly believe in long-term investing in S&P500 or Nasdaq100 index funds, and that's what I advise my clients to do for their retirement planning from their early age.

The problem arises with short- and medium-term investments. 

The more frequently my clients buy and sell individual stocks, the higher the fees I earn, which makes me wealthier. Leverage stocks like 3x tesla have much higher fees than index funds as you know.  

But clients who trade frequently tend to see lower returns over time. On the other hand, those who simply buy index funds consistently or hold onto blue-chip stocks like google or micorsoft for the long term usually achieve much better returns.

Of course, these long-term investors don’t generate as much revenue for me. Yet, I often find myself advising clients not to trade too often, even though I know this reduces my own income.

I'm thinking more about their story, how they make money, whether they do it consistently, P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA, low debt, etc. 

I lurk around on r/ValueInvesting and have gotten some good book recommendations, although I mostly use them for reference rather than reading them in their entirety. 

The S&P 500 was at a P/E ratio of over 100 in 2008 when the market crashed, although there have been pullbacks and recessions with lower P/Es than at current levels. All that to say, maybe the market is overvalued by traditional valuation metrics. I guess I'm trying to understand why many users and even successful YouTubers like Joseph Carlson and others recommend many high P/E companies. I gather that these companies have a sustainable competitive advantage with a lot of growth priced in. I'm talking about companies like SPGI, ASML, GOOGL (this actually seems like a growth company with decent valuations), UBER, ARM, NVDA, AVGO, META, FTNT, AMD, etc.

These companies seem to have a good moat, great CEO's, strong balance sheets but a lot of growth priced in. Frankly, it seems like one could do quite well with companies like these. I've underperformed significantly (thankfully with small positions for the purposes of gaining experience) picking stocks with what I thought were traditional value metrics, companies like HDSN, JILL, ALB, CP, VIRC, etc. Granted, I don't really feel like I have a circle of competence and didn't look too much into how these companies make money. I'll admit that I was riding mostly on the convictions of others, which I recognize is a major issue in itself that I intend to correct going forward. 

So for those of you who invest in individual companies and have had success, here are some questions;

1) Is it productive to differentiate between growth and value companies?

2) Is it fruitful to look for companies with a 10-15 P/E ratio and other ""deep value"" metrics or is traditional value investing dead altogether due to modern age computing power?

3) Does the rise in popularity of index investing exacerbate irrationality in markets to the point where valuations don't matter?

2025-01-07,19:58:01,investing,Nvidia: Expect Valuation To Soar Higher On 2025's AI Spending Increases,"# Summary

* Nvidia’s 2024 revenue surged by 86% to $113.3 billion, with operating income doubling to $71 billion.
* Hyperscalers are expected to increase AI-focused capital expenditures by 50% in 2025, reaching $300 billion.
* Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell architecture offers up to 15x performance improvements, securing its 90% market dominance in AI GPUs.
* Competitors like AMD and Broadcom struggle with ecosystem integration and software optimization, solidifying Nvidia’s lead.
* Analysts project a 50x earnings multiple and a target price of $225 per share for 2025.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) enjoyed unprecedented financial success in 2024, driven by a wave of hyperscaler investments in data center infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Revenues soared by 86%, reaching $113.3 billion, while operating income more than doubled to $71 billion, signaling the company’s dominance in the AI sector.

Despite such robust growth, concerns over a potential slowdown are misplaced. The global push toward AI and machine learning shows no signs of waning. Leading technology giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Google are significantly expanding their high-performance computing capabilities to meet the surging demand for generative AI, large language models, and advanced AI applications.

In 2024, hyperscaler capital expenditures on data centers totaled approximately $200 billion. For 2025, this figure is projected to rise by 50%, hitting $300 billion. According to Morgan Stanley, Amazon and Microsoft are set to lead this spending spree with investments of $96.4 billion and $89.9 billion, respectively. Google and Meta will closely follow, allocating $62.6 billion and $52.3 billion to their AI-driven infrastructure.

This aggressive investment is underpinned by statements from top executives. Google’s CFO noted that while growth in capital expenditures won’t match the leap between 2023 and 2024, further increases are expected. Similarly, Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted plans for significant growth in infrastructure spending. Microsoft, too, has committed $80 billion for AI-oriented data center construction in fiscal 2025.

Nvidia, with its 90% share of the AI GPU market, is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this surge in spending. The release of its next-generation Blackwell architecture in early 2025 promises substantial performance gains, including up to 2.5 times the training performance of its Hopper GPUs and as much as 15 times higher inference capabilities in select benchmarks. These advancements, paired with Nvidia’s proprietary CUDA platform, reinforce its unassailable ecosystem of hardware and software solutions.

Competitors like AMD and Broadcom continue to face hurdles. AMD’s MI300X GPUs, while promising on paper, have failed to deliver comparable performance due to software deficiencies. Broadcom’s custom silicon projects, although intriguing, lack the versatility and support ecosystem Nvidia GPUs provide. Consequently, neither competitor poses a significant threat in the near term, with meaningful competition unlikely before 2026 or 2027.

# TL;DR

Nvidia’s remarkable 2024 growth, fueled by hyperscaler investments, will continue as AI spending surges 50% in 2025 to $300 billion. With its dominant 90% GPU market share and groundbreaking Blackwell architecture, Nvidia is well-positioned for further success.

2025-01-07,17:36:04,investing,The potential AI stocks in 2025,"When think of AI stocks, the first names that come to my mind is $NVDA and $MSFT. NVIDIA dominates the AI hardware market with its GPU technology, while Microsoft, through its partnership with OpenAI, has become a benchmark in the AI software space.

Meanwhile, Applovin ($APP) has excelled in AI-driven advertising, with its stock price doubling in November, attracting widespread attention. But beyond these giants, there are still many ""hidden champions"" lurking among the small-cap stocks.

For example, $BBAI, which focuses on defense AI, and UiPath ($PATH), specializing in enterprise automation, have garnered attention from the capital markets due to their deep market positioning.

But, I am currently eyeing on $BGM's recent stock price fluctuations.

Recently, BGM completed its acquisition of AIFU’s insurance platform, marking a significant step in its transformation into the AI insurance sector. AIFU’s “DuXiaoBao” platform, powered by Baidu’s big data, is a prime example of such integration. It combines Baidu’s 704 million monthly active users with AIFU’s 48 million insurance sales network. Currently, the platform covers over 16.8 million customers and 17.5 million households. With BGM’s integration of medical resources, the user base and insurance coverage are expected to expand significantly, driving explosive growth for the company.

Traditional insurance sales rely on broker networks, but ""DuXiaoBao"" is changing the game by using Baidu and AIFU’s deep data models to offer tailored insurance solutions. In the future, it might even analyze users’ lifestyle and health data to predict their health risks over the next 30 years and design personalized insurance products based on that. Imagine if AI told you there was a 95% chance you’d be sick in the next 20-30 years and recommended an insurance product accordingly—would you buy it? This “smart + privacy” insurance sales model is truly disruptive.

This approach bears a striking similarity to Tesla’s innovation: Tesla used vehicle data to personalize car insurance, disrupting the traditional auto insurance industry, while BGM is using big data to empower insurance products, revolutionizing the customer experience.

Looking ahead, BGM might even leverage OpenAI’s technology to take the ""DuXiaoBao"" platform global, offering personalized health and insurance services to users worldwide. This vision of globalization and technological integration opens up even greater growth potential for the company.

BGM’s market cap is currently just around $60 million, compared to insurance giants like Prudential (market cap around $21.7 billion) and Prudential Financial (market cap around $46.1 billion), which are dozens of times its size.

2025-01-07,03:53:11,investing,Uber: A Great Buying Opportunity In Current Markets,"**Summary**

* Uber’s stock is currently undervalued due to market fears surrounding autonomous vehicles, but its robust fundamentals and durable business model make it a highly appealing investment.
* Key strengths include an extensive urban mobility database, loyal user base, and diversified sources of revenue.
* While the rise of self-driving technology presents certain risks, Uber’s strategic alliances, regulatory challenges for competitors, and market dominance ensure it remains well-positioned for sustained growth.
* Even cautious revenue and margin projections suggest considerable upside potential, making Uber an attractive choice with a strong margin of safety.

**The Impact of Market Narratives on Uber's Perception**

Recent announcements have reignited interest in autonomous driving. Tesla (TSLA) revealed plans to launch the Cybercab by 2027, while Google’s Waymo (GOOGL) announced expansion into Miami. These updates have led to a nearly 10% drop in Uber’s stock, contributing to a 15% decline over the past month.

This situation is reminiscent of past market narratives that impacted companies like Google and Meta (META). Both experienced temporary valuation drops due to overblown concerns but ultimately delivered strong returns, supported by solid fundamentals and competent management.

Uber continues to showcase impressive operational growth, strong cash flow, and consistent profitability, all while trading at historically low P/E multiples. These attributes, combined with its moat-driven business model, position Uber as a promising portfolio addition.

**Uber's Competitive Moats and the Importance of Strategic Management**

Uber’s advantages go beyond its network effects. Its unmatched urban mobility database allows for optimized routing, pricing, and seamless connections between users and drivers. Additionally, features like loyalty programs, subscriptions, and brand trust further enhance its competitive position in a sector where reliability and safety are crucial.

Diversification is another critical element in reducing risk. Similar to Google’s evolution beyond search, Uber has created a multifaceted platform that includes logistics and transportation. Delivery accounted for 30% of revenue in Q3, while freight contributed 11%, generating $1.3 billion despite not yet achieving positive EBITDA margins. These emerging segments have the potential to become significant revenue drivers in the future.

Furthermore, Uber’s investments in companies like Grab (GRAB) and DiDi (OTCPK:DIDIY) reflect a strategic approach to balancing profitability and competition. These equity stakes act as a form of optionality while demonstrating Uber’s ability to focus on long-term gains in key regions.

Uber’s management has shown remarkable capability in adapting to industry changes. Much like Meta’s successful redirection of investments, Uber is already positioning itself for the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Partnerships with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta exemplify its ability to integrate self-driving technology while retaining its platform leadership.

**Adapting to Regulations and Long-Term Mobility Trends**

The adoption of self-driving vehicles faces significant hurdles, including regulatory and infrastructure challenges, particularly in emerging markets that are critical to Uber’s business. While major cities like Los Angeles and Miami may adopt autonomous technology sooner, broader implementation is likely to take years, especially in regions such as Brazil, India, and Mexico.

In addition, overarching trends in urban mobility—including cost savings, easing traffic congestion, and the shift from ownership to access—support Uber’s long-term growth. Although the global ride-hailing market is already substantial, it remains underpenetrated in numerous regions, providing opportunities for continued expansion.

**Uber's Resilience Shines Even in Pessimistic Scenarios**

While autonomous vehicles pose potential risks, competition from local apps and evolving regulations may present more immediate challenges to Uber’s margins and market share. Nonetheless, analysts project Uber’s EPS to reach $4 by 2027 and $4.80 by 2028, resulting in P/E multiples of 15x and 12.8x, respectively.

Even under conservative assumptions, Uber’s revenue could exceed $74 billion by 2030, with margins reaching 11.5%. In a more optimistic outlook, margins of 17% would result in a P/E multiple around 10x, equating to an earnings yield of 10%—a compelling figure for a leader in a growing market.

Uber’s forward P/E and free-cash-flow multiples of 21.9x remain attractive given its growth trajectory and low current valuations. With management forecasting strong EBITDA growth and robust free-cash-flow conversion, Uber offers significant upside even if its market valuation remains steady.

**TLDR:** Uber’s long-term outlook remains favorable despite concerns over disruption from self-driving technology. Its diversified operations, strategic investments, and adaptability effectively mitigate potential risks. At its current valuation, Uber represents a strong investment opportunity with substantial potential for long-term shareholder returns.

2025-01-07,00:04:40,investing,This is why we dont buy Chinese stocks: US Dept of Defense Labels Tencent a military company ,"
From [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline?embedded-checkout=true):

The U.S. Department of Defense has added Tencent Holdings and CATL to its blacklist of companies allegedly linked to China's military, causing Tencent's U.S.-listed shares to drop nearly 10%. This move is part of the Pentagon's ""Section 1260H list,"" which now names 134 firms believed to support China's military-civil fusion strategy, where civilian tech is leveraged for military purposes.

Tencent, known for WeChat and major gaming investments, has denied the allegations and plans to work with U.S. authorities to clear up what it calls a misunderstanding. Similarly, CATL, a key supplier of EV batteries to Tesla, Ford, and BMW, refuted the claims, calling their inclusion a mistake and stating they have no involvement in military activities.

While the designation doesn't impose immediate sanctions, it signals increased risk for U.S. investors and partners. Companies previously added to this list, like DJI, have faced serious business disruptions, including bans and reputational hits.

Both Tencent and CATL are expected to challenge the decision, but this adds to the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. Investors should keep an eye on this situation as it could impact these stocks and broader U.S.-China market relations.

2025-01-06,22:10:21,investing,Recommendations for Portfolio Analysis Software,"I have been dabbling in the past year with investments, but I'm a very cautious profile.

2025-01-06,19:04:38,investing,Tesla's Deliveries Disappoint: Time To Take Profits (Rating Downgrade),"**Summary**

* Tesla's stock remains overvalued despite disappointing vehicle delivery numbers and slowing growth.
* The surge in Tesla's stock price is driven by enthusiasm for AI advancements, Elon Musk's charisma, and Donald Trump's election victory rather than improvements in the company's core business fundamentals.
* At 126 times projected earnings, Tesla’s valuation is far higher than both industry peers and even Nvidia, making it increasingly difficult to justify its current price.
* The company's challenges, including declining deliveries, suggest that much of its upside potential has already been priced in.
* Investors should consider taking profits while the stock is trading at near-record highs.

Tesla’s stock has been riding a wave of unprecedented enthusiasm, with its price reaching all-time highs despite recently published delivery numbers that fell short of analysts' expectations. This discrepancy highlights a growing disconnect between Tesla’s market valuation and its actual performance. The company, once known for its relentless growth and innovation, delivered fewer cars in 2024 than in 2023, marking its first-ever year of declining deliveries. Despite this, Tesla’s stock price has surged by 63% in 2024, demonstrating how much investor sentiment rather than fundamental growth is driving its valuation.

In my October analysis, I discussed how Tesla’s slowing delivery growth and declining net income, despite aggressive price cuts, were becoming evident concerns. Even the highly anticipated robotaxi event failed to deliver the excitement that investors had hoped for, leading to a drop in the stock price at the time. While Tesla was already trading at a premium then, its valuation has only become more stretched in the months since.

The most recent data on Tesla’s deliveries reveals troubling trends. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company delivered 495,570 vehicles, falling short of the 512,300 deliveries expected by analysts. This shortfall contributed to a total of 1.79 million vehicles delivered for the year, a slight decline from the 1.81 million delivered in 2023. While the drop in deliveries may seem modest, it is significant as it breaks Tesla’s streak of consistent year-over-year growth, which had previously been a hallmark of its success. This is especially notable given the company’s reliance on vehicle sales for approximately 80% of its revenue. Without sustained growth in this area, the rationale for holding Tesla as a growth stock diminishes considerably.

From 2020 to 2023, Tesla experienced remarkable growth in deliveries, with annual numbers climbing steadily. However, 2024 marked a departure from this trend, with sales stagnating and then declining. Quarterly delivery figures also highlight the slowdown, with growth peaking in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently stalling. This lack of growth is especially concerning for a company that reinvests all earnings into future expansion rather than paying dividends to shareholders. Tesla’s business model hinges on its ability to grow continuously, and the absence of that growth undermines its investment appeal.

Despite these challenges, Tesla’s stock has soared, buoyed by investor excitement over its advancements in artificial intelligence, Elon Musk’s magnetic persona, and the political implications of Donald Trump’s recent election victory. Musk has repeatedly emphasized Tesla’s position as a leader in AI and robotics, which has further fueled optimism among investors. Additionally, Tesla’s stock experienced significant gains following the November election, with investors speculating that Trump’s administration might ease regulations related to self-driving technology. However, such regulatory changes would only be beneficial if Tesla achieves full autonomy, an ambitious milestone that remains elusive.

Tesla’s valuation underscores the risks of the current enthusiasm. The stock is now trading at an extraordinary 126 times projected earnings, a multiple that far exceeds even AI powerhouse Nvidia, which trades at around 42 times earnings. Comparisons with legacy automakers further highlight the disparity. Tesla’s market cap of $1.2 trillion is greater than that of the next 20 largest automakers combined, yet it delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than in 2023. This disconnect raises questions about whether Tesla’s valuation can be justified in the absence of tangible growth.

Tesla’s performance relative to Nvidia provides another perspective on the stock’s overvaluation. While both companies have benefited from their association with AI, Tesla’s stock has outperformed Nvidia’s despite facing significant headwinds in its core business. This suggests that investor enthusiasm for Tesla may be outpacing its actual achievements.

Although Tesla remains a leader in EV production and is recognized for its innovative technologies, including AI and robotics, these factors are already priced into the stock. The company’s market leadership positions it well to benefit from long-term trends in EV adoption, but its challenges in the short term, including declining deliveries and uncertain profitability from new ventures, make its current valuation appear precarious.

In conclusion, Tesla’s stock is trading at unsustainable levels given its recent performance. While the company’s technological advancements and market leadership are undeniable, its reliance on investor sentiment rather than business fundamentals makes it a risky investment at these prices. Taking profits now would allow investors to capitalize on the stock’s near-record highs while avoiding potential losses should the market reassess Tesla’s valuation. While the enthusiasm surrounding Tesla may persist in the short term, prudence suggests that this is an opportune moment to exit the position.

* **Consistency works:** Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!
* **Stock selection matters:** The ""Magnificent 7"" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.
* **Patience is key:** I didn’t touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.

2025-01-05,16:42:39,investing,"$1,000 Invested Per Week Update 1/5","Hope everyone had a great week and a great start to the New Year! I was able to contribute another $1,000 to my brokerage account this week. Here's the key highlights.

**December 30 Balance:** $129,157.32  
**January 3 Balance:** $134,381.97  
**Weekly Contribution:** $1,000

This week was a roller coaster. My account dropped as low as $127,242.76 before rebounding on Friday. I try not to check my account every day to avoid the temptation of panic selling. The volatility can be tough to watch, but I try to stay focused on the long-term prospects of my holdings.

When I had my cash available, I purchased more MSTR since it took a substantial dip. I lowered my cost average down to $417.78, which is a realized loss of 18.7%. I will continue adding to this position as long as it is lower than my cost average. I now hold 49.138 shares.

I am also going to explore write some covered calls against a few of my holdings. I do this in my retirement account regularly, but I haven't done it much in my brokerage account because of tax implications. I will post updates if I decide to do that. I would love to generate some extra cash to begin buying some non-tech stocks and diversify the portfolio. As many of you stated last week, I certainly felt the effects of not diversifying when the NASDAQ was hammered in the middle of the week. I like some of the ideas people proposed last week, and I have added them to my watch list. If you have any other ideas that look good for 2025, please let me know in the comments.

It's also becoming very tempting to sell my LUNR contracts. They are up 650% since I purchased them, but I am trying to hold them through the launch later this month. We will see if that actually happens, or I might sell off two of my contracts to lock in gains and let the other two ride.

Here's an overview of my holdings. The only change was adding more MSTR this week.

**Current Holdings:**  
\- QQQ: 101.714 shares worth $52,832.41  
\- AMZN: 101.565 shares worth $22,769.85  
\- MSTR: 49.138 shares worth $16,690.21  
\- PANW: 80 shares worth $14,660.00.  
\- NVDA: 100.374 shares worth $14,501.03  
\- LUNR Call: 4 contracts (March 2025, $6 strike) worth $6,300  
\- CRWD: 10.753 shares worth $3,860.54  
\- META: 3.867 shares worth $2,338.10  
\- TGTX Call: 3 contracts (February 2025, $37 strike) worth $429.00

2025-01-05,05:45:40,investing,What is everyone reading for business/stock news,"So as I learn more about investing I'm realizing there are a TON of websites giving different stories on companies etc. What are the top 10 websites that are giving the most trusted/accurate information? I would like them to be free but I understand some do charge for a subscription nowadays. 

Next before investing in a company what are we looking at?

\* 10Q?

\*Trends?

\*quarterly reports?

\*latest news and once again from what sites? I'm willing to read 12 hours a day. 

\*It's hard for me to determine what's making a stock news based of what information?

\*Like why is Warren Buffet in OXY and not Exxon mobile? I'd like to read and find out but I don't want to waste time of bad news providing websites. 

\*Does anyone look at the buys and sells of the day?

\*For example I watched Tesla fall about $30 the other day due to a report saying they sold less vehicles. Then the next day skyrocketed past the $30 loss.. How do you know for one the stock would skyrocket past the $30 mark and what trusted websites or news articles did you read when you found out they missed their sales mark?

  
Sorry I ask a lot of questions but I don't want to go into this blindly when it comes to buying and selling stocks. I also appreciate all the information about the kiddos, I think I'll be going into the 529.

2025-01-01,08:36:43,investing,Bitcoin Isn’t Unique But Infinite—$100K Is Beyond Absurd,"Imagine this: air, the most abundant and freely available resource on Earth. Everyone can breathe it without restriction, it’s everywhere, and it costs nothing. Now, imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles, claiming, “Only 21 million bottles will ever exist.” They sell the bottles, marketing them as rare and special, and soon, the price of a single bottle soars to $100,000.

But here’s the catch: anyone can grab the same air, bottle it themselves, impose their own arbitrary limits, and sell it too. The air inside these bottles is identical, same purity, same ability to sustain life. Yet somehow, the original company convinces people their air is unique, while the others are dismissed as worthless. This isn’t just absurd but comically irrational. And yet, it’s a perfect analogy for Bitcoin.

Think about it: bottling air to sell is ridiculous. Why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available? Worse, imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system—one consuming massive amounts of electricity, requiring complex networks, and involving global participants—to package, transfer, and store this bottled air. This is the level of absurdity we reach with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s defenders often point to its decentralization, anonymity, and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. But what is this decentralized system really securing? Digital air. The units being produced, transferred, and protected represent nothing—they are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. Anyone with the technical knowledge can clone Bitcoin’s code, impose their own arbitrary cap, and launch their own cryptocurrency.

This brings us to the critical difference between Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies: cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless.

Stocks represent ownership in a company. A company cannot be copied like a piece of code. The value of a share is tied to the performance, assets, and operations of that unique entity. You cannot clone Tesla or Apple, and therefore, you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. Stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite, tied to real-world assets, operations, and innovation.

Fiat currencies, on the other hand, represent units of debt. They are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers—companies, governments, or individuals—to repay them. Banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real-world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. No one can walk into a bank and request a trillion-dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it.

Cryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. If you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow, nothing stops you. Bitcoin’s 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the Bitcoin protocol, adjust the parameters, and produce trillions of coins in their own system. In this way, cryptocurrencies represent nothing—no ownership, no debt, no tangible connection to the real economy. They are the digital equivalent of bottling air, infinitely replicable with no inherent value.

Bitcoin’s defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable, likening it to gold. But unlike gold, Bitcoin’s scarcity is artificial and replicable. Limiting Bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming, “We’re only producing 21 million bottles.” The air is still abundant, and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits.

The absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing, transferring, and storing these digital tokens. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations, and yet what is being protected? A digital representation of air, something freely available, infinitely replicable, and ultimately meaningless.

Bitcoin’s price doesn’t reflect the value of its features. If decentralization, anonymity, and security were truly valuable, Bitcoin’s clones, many of which improve on these features, would share its valuation. Instead, Bitcoin’s price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. People aren’t paying $100,000 because Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency; they’re paying because they believe someone else will pay more.

This speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin’s features are infinitely replicable, and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost, the illusion will collapse.

Bitcoin isn’t digital gold, nor is it a revolutionary asset. It’s a digital air, packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. Paying $100,000 for a single Bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. The elaborate decentralized system supporting Bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost.

When the hype fades, and the absurdity of the system becomes clear, Bitcoin’s price will plummet, leaving behind the inescapable truth: no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.",TSLA,Tesla

2024-12-29,01:26:31,investing,"Monthly Investing Update: $1,000/week Journey to Financial Freedom","Hey everyone!   
  
I am a longtime lurker, but I am hopeful people may feel inspired by financial journey over the last year or so.   
  
For background, I’m an assistant principal at a local elementary school, and my wife runs her own tutoring and education consulting business. Together, we’ve been focused on building a secure financial future while balancing busy lives. This post is part of my ongoing journey of consistent investing. As of November 13, 2023, I began contributing $1,000 weekly to my brokerage account. Previously, I had dabbled in investing since 2021 but without consistency.  I deposited a little extra money here and there, but I wasn't consistent in my approach and didn't prioritize it. This is my story and an update on where I stand today.

**Portfolio Snapshot as of December 2024:**  
  
Starting Balance (November 13, 2023): $44,403.12  
Current Balance (December 26, 2024): $131,615.84

**Monthly Contributions:** $4,000 - $5,000 (depending on the number of weeks per month)

**Current Holdings:**  
\- QQQ: 101.714 shares worth $53,151.66  
\- AMZN: 101.565 shares worth $22,725.16  
\- MSTR: 45.279 shares worth $14,942.07

**Lessons Learned:**

\- **Compounding Takes Time but Works:** I’ve started noticing compounding effects really kick in. Some months, my portfolio’s growth outpaced my monthly salary, which is both surreal and inspiring.

\- **Volatility is Real:** Watching significant swings in my portfolio value is tough. To manage this, I’ve adopted a ""set it and forget it"" mindset and avoid checking my account daily.

**- Stay Consistent:** It’s easy to get caught up in market trends and daily life, but staying consistent with contributions has been the most rewarding strategy.

**Why I’m Sharing:**

I hope to inspire others who might be hesitant about investing. I realize $1,000 isn't possible for everyone - I'm extremely lucky to be able to do this - but I think starting with even $50 a week or a month can be impactful. Financial independence is achievable with consistency, discipline, and patience. 

For transparency, I focus solely on my brokerage account in these posts, even though I also fully fund my Roth IRA, 403(b), and my wife’s self-directed 401(k). We also maintain a hands-off Acorns account with about $60,000. I’ve thought about moving that money to Fidelity but appreciate the safety and simplicity it offers.

**Looking Ahead:**

Starting in January, I plan to post each week to give a closer look at my journey. I’ll share more details on my strategy and lessons as they unfold.

2024-12-28,21:03:52,investing,How to invest in broad market minus a few stocks?,"Most of my money's in index funds, but there are a few stocks that I don't believe are worth paying for.

I pretty much want an index fund like VOO minus a few stocks such as APPL, TSLA, MSTR (especially TSLA and MSTR). Idealy a financial institution would provide a bunch (500+) check boxes for each compaany (sorted by market cap) where by default it buys the same fraction of each stock.

Essentially I want to create a custom index fund where my custom fund has almost every notable company in the USA or the world. I like being lazy and do not want to buy 500+ stocks ever time I get a paycheck.

From googling around there are services that offer something called ""direct indexing"" but I don't see why buying / selling a market proportional ammount should cost 0.4% / year. I also do not understand why there would need to be ""rebalancing"" since ETFs such as VOO own (throwing out a number) 5% of everything and buy / sell as people buy / sell the ETF.",TSLA,Tesla

2024-12-23,17:12:33,investing,"When Tech Eventually Fizzles, Will U.S. Continue to Dominate? Backtesting Excluding Tech vs. Global Markets","Edit: People are misunderstanding the question. I’m not bearish on tech. It’s more of a question of US continuing to out perform the global market once the expected returns on tech slows.

TL;DR: As tech’s strong performance fades (maybe it doesn’t, but eventually, it might), why should we believe the U.S. market will continue to outperform globally? Has anyone already backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech—especially the “Magnificent 7”—and compared its performance to developed and emerging markets?

Over the past 15 years, the U.S. market has massively outperformed global equities, leading to the narrative that U.S. governance, monetary policy, the strength of the dollar (as the global reserve currency), and favorable geopolitical conditions will continue to support this dominance. This view is widely accepted in this community (you can find tons of discussions on this by searching “international” here if you haven’t already).

However, the primary driver of U.S. outperformance has been the tech sector, particularly the “Magnificent 7” (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta). A quick search shows that these companies have been responsible for a significant portion of U.S. market returns over the past two decades, with tech alone contributing heavily to the growth of the S&P 500.

But what happens when the tech sector eventually hits a slowdown or correction? While it could continue to dominate for another decade, at some point, the market may shift, and another sector or region could rise to prominence. So, if tech (especially the Magnificent 7) loses its edge, what is left to support U.S. market dominance?

I’m particularly interested in whether anyone has backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech stocks (especially the MAG 7) and compared its performance against global markets—both developed and emerging. Excluding the top tech names from the S&P 500 could provide a more realistic view of the underlying market performance without the distortion caused by these mega-cap stocks, which are arguably overvalued or at least priced for significant future growth.

I’m asking this because, as a long-term, passive investor, I think the MAG 7 may be overvalued, and their strong returns over the past 15 years might not be sustainable. To further diversify my portfolio, I’ve begun investing in US mid and small-cap S&P funds, but I’m also looking to increase my exposure to global equities. From what I can see, excluding tech from the equation, international equities don’t appear to underperform as much relative to U.S. stocks. So, I’m interested in seeing if global diversification, especially in emerging markets, would still yield solid returns after this adjustment.

A few questions I have:
Has anyone conducted a backtest or analysis of the S&P 500’s performance excluding the Magnificent 7? How does it compare to global markets, particularly developed and emerging markets?

If tech returns eventually fizzle out (or at least grow more slowly), should we expect the U.S. to continue outperforming? What other sectors or factors might drive U.S. market growth in the future?

I’ve prepared myself for critical feedback—Drag me.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

Has anyone conducted a backtest or analysis of the S&P 500’s performance excluding the Magnificent 7? How does it compare to global markets, particularly developed and emerging markets?

If tech returns eventually fizzle out (or at least grow more slowly), should we expect the U.S. to continue outperforming? What other sectors or factors might drive U.S. market growth in the future?

Here is how I divvy it up, can y'all provide feedback/opinions on my investing strategy please?","I'm an early 30s single guy with a solid income. I invest $1885.00 every week which amounts to roughly half of my take home pay, and I live off the other half.

I live in a very high cost of living city and I rent an apartment. I've got a very long time horizon so I'm trying to be aggressive.

Here is how I divvy my money:

Stock | Amount Invested | Percentage of investment
:--|:--:|--:
S&P 500 ETF (VOO) | $700 | 37.14%
NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) | $400 | 21.22%
MAG 6 (no Tesla) | $180 ($30 each) | 9.55%
Small Caps (AVUV) | $120 | 6.37%
Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) | $100 | 5.30%
Financial Sector ETFs (XLF and IAI) * | $80 ($40 each) | 4.244%
Semiconductors ETF (SMH) | $80 | 4.244%
Individual Stock Picks I like (15 in total, listed below) ** | $225 ($15 each) | 11.94%
**TOTAL** | $1885 | 100%

*The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc..., whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schwab, S&P Global etc... There is only a 15% overlap between these two ETFs.

**The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are: Adobe (ADBE), AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Chipotle (CMG), Salesforce (CRM), Door Dash (DASH), Netflix (NFLX), ServiceNow (NOW), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Palantir (PLTR), Shopify (SHOP), Sofi Bank (SOFI), Uber (UBER)

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

I'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).

It was ignored coz' no one was buying much. It's always tough to see looking forward (it's always looking back of course that one see gems that could be hidden), though I always look at who's creating what, who's the real leader and Canoo's leader seems maybe a few percentages of Elon Musk. 

The Canoo founder has a lot of patents it seems, innovative it seem similar to Elon (but not as big like Elon's pre-Tesla and SpaceX, like PayPal or Zip2) had a successful venture (Solera I think). 

But only time will tell if the pattern will repeat itself with Canoo, it has a great design, innovative, especially their MPDV (I wish that was the one they focused on but had a smaller non-van version with the same). It just needs to launch already their working models (unlike that Nikola truck which even got GM fooled) have amazing design especially the shelf mechanism of their nice looking MPDV. 

If they just did a pre-order which is a genius strategy pioneered by amazing Apple, God-willing they will break through but they also need to upgrade their battery from 200mi to 320mi for good measure. They need to launch now coz' the chinese EVs are coming with tariffs by Pres. Trump or not- it's like 'finished or not finished pass your papers.'

2024-12-17,01:24:17,investing,Ponzi Spotting: a laymen's guide to differentiating investments from Ponzi schemes,"I often see things being called Ponzi schemes on Reddit that are very much not Ponzi schemes. Usually, it always stems from the criticism that a particular investment only goes up in price because someone newer is paying a higher price for it. Hence, it must be a Ponzi.

I’m going to blow your minds a little bit. 

Almost all (legitimate) investments require new investors willing to pay a higher price for older investors to cash out a profit. 

Most investable objects, REGARDLESS of what underlies the object, trade at a price on a market. This means, at the margin, some percentage (usually only a small percentage) of the total available supply of the object is trading hands. The trade is priced typically in your local fiat currency, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. Prices are determined by supply and demand. When an investable object goes up in price on a market, it means there were no sellers of the object at the lower price, and price goes up until the next marginal seller decides they are willing to part with that object at the higher price. 

The use of the term investable object is intentionally left extremely broad. It essentially means anything quantifiable that can be owned and traded. This includes contracts, stocks, bonds, physical objects, digital objects, etc. 

**Example 1.** You bought a 1st edition charizard for 20 dollars when it came out in the 1990’s. Since it was relatively abundant (still being printed by the company) and Pokemon was relatively new at the time, the supply was high and the demand was low. Fast forward 30 years, Pokemon is super popular and there are very few 1st edition charizards remaining (out of print for decades, many were lost or destroyed through the years). You now are able to sell the charizard for 10,000 dollars to a guy that just got into Pokemon card collecting. Congratulations, you bought low and sold high! Was what you participated in a Ponzi scheme because you (an old investor) made a profit by selling to a new investor?

I really hope your answer to this is no. If you think the answer is yes, you can stop reading here, because I don’t think anything I’m going to say beyond this point is going to help you.

The next step in logic is realizing this charizard example is essentially how ALL INVESTMENT RETURNS are made when the investable object at hand is not providing a direct flow of cash. This is true for non-dividend (which is the vast majority) stocks, derivatives, physical collectibles like pet rocks/beanie babies/tulip bulbs, and digital collectibles like in-game skins/NFTs/cryptocurrencies, etc. Examples of cash flowing investments would be dividend stocks, direct ownership of small businesses such that net profits are available to you, or rental properties. It is important to note while ultimately supply and demand determine if a price for an investable object goes up over time, the underlying reason an investable object has demand at all can be wildly different from object to object. The reason some people want first edition charizards is usually a very different reason people want to own a stock of a company. It is within the eye of the investor to decide if the reason is a good reason, and hopefully a reason that leads to increased demand in the future.

So, what is a Ponzi? According to ChatGPT, a Ponzi scheme is “a fraudulent investment scam that promises high returns with little or no risk to investors. The scheme relies on using the funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors, rather than generating legitimate profit from actual investments or business activities. Eventually, the scheme collapses when it becomes impossible to recruit enough new investors or when too many existing investors try to withdraw their money at the same time.”

That seems like a pretty good definition to me! The part that everyone focuses on when thinking about a Ponzi is this part: “the scheme relies on using funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors.” This sounds extremely similar to my charizard example, yet I hope you have the intellectual honesty to accept that a real Ponzi scheme is different from buying low and selling high. 

The part that is extremely important, in addition to old investor returns being funded by new investors, is that the scheme PROMISES a return. The reality is that many Ponzi schemes do not start off as Ponzi schemes. There are sometimes investment funds that partake briefly in Ponzi-like behavior to paper over potential insolvency during a downturn, and then return to legitimate investment activities when the market improves. Doing this is quite risky and is still illegal, because if you aren’t able to essentially over deliver (and underpromise) on future returns to even things out, you’re essentially stuck in an endless cycle of repaying old investors who cash out with newer investor money, turning your once legitimate investment fund into a Ponzi scheme. The right move is to always be open and honest about what returns you’re able to achieve for your investors to avoid being stuck in the Ponzi-loop I described. 

Another attribute of Ponzi schemes is that Ponzi’s almost always violently collapse once the perceived value of the fund goes down. This is because once a Ponzi stops attracting new money, it becomes apparent very quickly that the liabilities of the fund far outstrip the assets. 

**Example 2.** Imagine a hypothetical Ponzi scheme. The Ponzi fund initially accepted $1,000 dollars from 10 eager investors in a local town. The fund manager promises a 10% annual yield so that in 1 year’s time, any of the original investors can withdraw $1,100, if they so please. Unfortunately, our manager really sucks at operating this Ponzi, and after 1 year, obtains exactly zero new clients. His liabilities at the end of the year are now $11,000, but he only has $10,000 of cash on hand. Even more unfortunately for him, Taylor Swift is announced to be coming to town and tickets are on sale now, and the tickets incidentally cost $1,100. All his investors want to cash out immediately so they ask for their money back. The first 9 that come to him are able to get their money back ($1,100 x 9 = $9,900). When the 10th person comes back, he realizes there’s only $100 for him, not the $1,100 he was promised! The fund not only has basically no money left, it owes $1000. The 10th person notifies the police, and our unfortunate fund manager is arrested for fraud. 

I will note that in this example, this scheme required 90% of the investors to withdraw for the scheme to collapse, but examples in history tend to be much more skewed, where even a small withdrawal of 1-5% of investors can completely collapse the scheme.

Returning to the investable object definition, once a Ponzi runs out of new investors to pay prior investors, the investable object completely disappears because the fund you thought was flush with desirable investable objects (that could be sold on an open market for hopefully higher than you originally paid for) actually had a negative cash balance the entire time! Behind the curtain, there actually was no object at all. This is in contrast to our buy low sell high example with the charizard card. The charizard market could hypothetically collapse tomorrow such that the market price drops from $10,000 to $1. Maybe everyone collectively realizes Pokemon is super lame, and that Yugioh is the superior card game. At the end of the day, there are two truths: you still own the investable object aka the charizard, and no one promised you a return for owning it. You can always wait it out, hoping that people become interested in charizards (and Pokemon) again. 

I hope this somewhat lengthy piece was helpful in elucidating Ponzi schemes for anyone that read this far. I often see CLEARLY non-Ponzi investable objects being echo-chambered as Ponzi’s on Reddit, when it really stems from a misunderstanding of the investable object, or the mechanics of investment itself. If your investable object trades on an open market, and nominal gains are made through price increases due to supply and demand dynamics, it is almost certainly not a Ponzi. If nobody is promising you a return, it also probably isn’t a Ponzi. This does not mean your investable object itself is not a scam or a bubble. That determination should be made with your best judgment of the fundamentals that underlie the object itself. I will leave you with 2 final examples to illustrate this. 

**Example 3.** Tesla stock is neither a Ponzi (trades on open market) nor a scam (they actually sell cars, batteries, etc for a profit). It might be a bubble if you think the company’s market cap is too high for what its future profits will be.

**Example 4.** Nikola stock is not a Ponzi (stock traded on open market), but it was a scam. The CEO lied to investors about how functional the cars were (they weren’t), and how many they sold (pretty much zero).",TSLA,Tesla
2024-12-16,21:02:39,investing,"Reminder: If You Trade More, Wall Street Makes More Money","I've spent a few years reading Warren Buffett and other value investors. Essentially what I learned is that they make money by other people pushing prices too high or too low. Especially when prices become too low, they swoop in and buy a bunch. Next they sit on it a few years until the price goes to the correct valuation again, or preferably after many years when the company deteriorates.

Time and time again, people have predicted that Buffett's strategy will eventually stop working. We nowadays can learn much more etc etc.

Yet, stock prices are all over the place. Tesla doubled in the last 3 months for example. How is that possible? How can a 1T dollar company double in value in 3 months? They still build the same stuff with roughly the same people. Similar for Bitcoin. Also almost doubled in a few months. If that was inevitable according to some metric, then why was it not priced in?

At the same time, there is a common sentiment online that the world is becoming more and more unequal. More wealth accumulates in the hands of a few people.

So let me say this: if you are currently considering buying into some stock that went up recently, please let me remind you that there is only one party that will always make money from your trade. It's not you. It's your broker/Wall Street. They don't care whether you make money or lose money. Some will slam ""price targets"" on stocks if that makes you trade. Some will call other stocks ""uninvestible"" if that makes you trade.",TSLA,Tesla

This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*

I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. 

**Investment strategy:**

1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  
2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  
3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  
4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*

I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.

**Looking forward:**

Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!

My next goal will be to reach $300,000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think? Achievable?",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024).

2024-12-16,08:57:33,investing,Investing in publicly-traded assets to benefit from AI automation,"What are the best strategies/channels to access investments that are hypothesized to benefit from advancements in AI and agentic workflow automation?

Are there funds focused on this? I'm specifically thinking about how some big public incumbent companies will be hurt by it (like Chegg) and others will greatly benefit from it. There must be a number of criteria that can be evaluated based on publicly available data and are hypothesized to correlate with positive financial outcomes in the age of AI automation. For example:

\-big white collar labor expenditures as a percentage of revenue and costs, indicating an outsized return on bottom line EBITDA from investing in AI automation

\-large audiences

\-large proprietary databases and content

\-large R&D budgets

\-defensible network effects. etc.

How can I easily and effectively invest to benefit from these kinds of hypotheses? For the sake of focus, fine to focus the conversation on publicly traded stocks and funds.

I know there are AI tools to analyze SEC filings, and I could build a list of hypotheses to evaluate, but this is a lot of work and others are better suited to do it than I (and I assume already have).

2024-12-12,18:51:03,investing,Returning to active stock portfolio management,"I recently decided to return to active stock portfolio management after my first attempt ended somewhat disastrously. To reconcile this experience and entertain others, I want to reflect on the mistakes I made and the new approaches I’ve adopted.

But first, briefly, the story of my initial failure.

When I started managing my portfolio, I quickly learned about the S&P 500 but was convinced I was smart enough to outperform the market. Arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall.

In 2019, I flirted with Bitcoin, which initially delivered great returns. Encouraged by the hype, I also invested heavily in PaySafe shortly after its IPO, believing in its potential because “everyone” said it was going to be great. At the same time, I was doing a lot of day trading. Looking back, I realize I wasn’t trading rationally. I’d look at graphs and invest simply because I felt the price would go up. I was taking desirable outcomes for granted.

Although I made a few conservative and reasonable investments, their success couldn’t offset the losses caused by Bitcoin’s decline, PaySafe’s terrible performance, and my risky trading. After 18 months, my portfolio was down 40%.

The arrogance I started with made the loss feel devastating. I abandoned my investment account for several years.

When I returned to it a year ago, I discovered that the growth of my conservative investments, along with Bitcoin’s recovery, had boosted my portfolio to 20% growth from my initial investment. I sold everything and bought into the S&P 500, feeling that I wasn’t capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund. This turned out to be a good action, as the S&P 500 performed very well this year.

Now, I feel I’ve learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again. 

To avoid repeating the same mistakes, I’ve set specific rules to guide me:

1. I Avoid Speculative Investments
I now steer clear of speculative assets like crypto, IPO stocks, or companies like Tesla. I want to be a disciplined investor, keeping my greed under control.  

2. I Reject Market Timing
I no longer believe in timing the market but instead focus on time in the market. I avoid trying to “buy low today and sell high tomorrow” because it’s too easy to confuse wishful thinking with reality. Paying attention to micro events can help to take advantage of daily fluctuations, but it requires too much time and still, offers uncertain outcomes. More often than not, it doesn’t pay off.

3. Focus on Debt-to-Equity
In the past, I ignored the debt-to-equity ratio. Now, I prioritize companies with consistent net income and manageable debt levels.

4. Limit Individual Stock Exposure
I cap my individual stock picks at 5% of my total portfolio. Previously, this rule would have forced me to find 20 or more stocks to invest in, leading to choosing assets that were just “okay” rather than ones I genuinely liked. Thankfully, with most of my portfolio now in the S&P 500, individual stock picks act as a good supplement rather than a replacement for the index.

5. Invest in Goods and Services I Value
My approach to stock selection has shifted. I now look for companies whose products and services I personally interact with and consider them of great value. If the companies also demonstrate strong financial performance and maintain a reasonable debt-to-equity ratio, they become my choice.

I hope these rules will help me sleep well at night, keep me from obsessing over financial news, and generate decent returns that complement the S&P 500.",TSLA,Tesla

2024-12-08,19:16:40,investing,Portfolio allocation talk,"Hello all, after months of my own research I've made a portolio. I want to preface this by saying this is not a post looking for advice. I am just wanting to tell you all the investments I've made and the reasons behind them. Also, there is some overlap between my individual picks and my ETF picks. I know.

**First, the foundation**

Like any smart investor you need a solid base. Something that will grow steadily and won't make you want to sell out when there is an inevitable market crash. This is why for my first pie, I have gone with 80% VUAG and 20% IGLA.

**Tech Focus**

People may say that my portfolio is too heavily weighted towards the USA and tech, I think the tech giants like Apple etc are not going anywhere. So my allocations are as follows,

Amazon- Moving into the AI space with Nova, Revenue growing steadily YOY.

Microsoft- Almost in the 'too big to fail' category. Not going anywhere and an easy choice IMO.

Alphabet- Recovered well and quickly after 2022 crash. Massive AI player. Easy choice

Apple- Still most popular in the Phone space. Can only see this stock going one way.

Meta- Absolutely flying in recent years. Hopeful Zuck will keep it up.

ASML- Riskier pick but believe they will have a good year next year. Looking 4-5 years into the future with this one.

Nvidia- Don't think I need to say too much with this choice. Looking long term, very excited about this one.

IonQ- Main player in quantum computing space, looking at some volatile years upcoming but I have faith that they could be huge in 5+ years.

**Consumer Focus**

Costco wholesale- Almost unshakeable business model, no strong competition IMO.

Pets at home- Smaller allocation for this one. Seems undervalued to me as people are always going to treat their pets. Will keep tabs on this one as still unsure.

Procter and Gamble- Been around for a million years. Very stable with dividend growth YOY.

Walmart- Consumer powerhouse in USA, strong financials and IMO not going anywhere,#

**Finance Focus**

Berkshire Hathaway- Trust in Buffett, no pressure from short term market trends.

Intuit- Dividend growth YOY, in an incredible place financially.

JP Morgan and Chase- In the 'too big to fail' category in my opinion. Involved in so many industries so not dependent on one for revenue.

MasterCard- Very able to adapt to the market, only risk is inflation IMO.

PayPal- After share price crash in 2022. Revenues didn't faulter and net income bounced back within the year. Undervalued IMO.

S&P Global- Adapting well to new tech such as AI. Been around forever.

**Real Estate Focus**

Realty income- Unshaken by the market crashes in past 20 years. Dividend Growth YOY.

VICI properties- Predictable revenue due to triple net leases. In a strong financial postion.

I think I have a good mix of sectors and stability/growth. I am not looking for advice but will take onboard any criticism.

2024-12-08,13:47:50,investing,"I'm bullish on Rivian, and here is why.","Currently holding 65 shares, looking to round that out to 100 next pay period.  I am not a financial advisor, and this is not investment advice. I am simply sharing my thoughts. 

These are the things I will be watching this year, to continue to add to my position, or to see if I should reconsider my bullish sentiment. 

1. Nearing profitability.  Rivian has recently re-affirmed that by Q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. They are expected to deliver just over 50,000 vehicles for the year. That is a combination of mostly R1S and R1T with some of the Amazon delivery vans. If there guidance is correct, and they either meet or beat q4 '24 earnings, it is a bullish sign.

  
2. $6 Billion loan from Uncle Sam. Now the new administration does create a bit of tension here.  The new ""DOGE"" agency is going to be cutting Gov. spending across the board. There is some concern they will take away this loan that the Biden administration had given to Rivian. While this is certainly a possibility, I do not think it is going to happen. I think it would be a very bad look politically, and would give strength to the argument musk will us his Gov. connections to attack his competitors. Because of that, I think this money is safely staying with Rivian.  If it turns out DOGE is going to back down from this threat, that is another bullish sign.

  
3. VW Rivian joint venture. VW NA is about to change, they are getting a new CEO, Kjell Gruner, who previously was the President and CEO of Porsche Cars of North America and then moved to Rivian to be there ""Chief Commercial Officer & President, Business Growth"".  VW desperatley needs software expertise, and Rivian delivers that in spades. That combined with VWs massive buying and production power, is a strong match. This is a bullish sign right now, and what I think has been pushing to stock upwards. 

VW has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits.  The introduction of the old/new Scout brand, that looks mighty similar to Rivians R2 concepts. As well as confirming the deal with Rivian, it looks like they're finally going to start to take serious steps to rebuilding their reputation, especially in NA. 

  
4. Rivians customers are happy, and according to a recent Consumer Reports Survey, 86% of owners say they would buy a Rivian again, better than Tesla. If they are happy with their purchase, they will talk to their other wealthy friends about their Rivian, word of mouth is very powerful.

  
5. The inevitable Tesla Comparison. RIVIAN IS NOT TESLA. Now obviously Tesla the company in 2024 is very different to Tesla the company in 2015. Back in 2015 it was the 3rd year of Model S production and the first of Model X. 

in 2015 Tesla sold just over 50,000 Model S. Now in 2023, just two years after the Rivian R1T debuted, Rivian sold just over 47,000 vehicles. I think Tesla in 2015 is more of a fair comparison to Rivian now in 2024, but Tesla now in 2024 is not so comparable to Rivian now in 2024.

  
I think Rivian makes a fantastic product, and there's a bright future ahead for them.",TSLA,Tesla

The reason that my portfolio contains more than 20 stocks is that I want to diversify it in terms of the stocks, not types of assets. 

My concerns/questions are:

1. I'm not sure if I hold too many stocks in the same category (e.g. tech stocks) and most of them are already covered by the IWDA ETF.
2. I'm also considering holding only 1 or 2 high-dividend stocks like AbbVie, instead of 5 dividend stocks. Is it a good idea?
3. My long-term plan follows ""time in the market > timing the market"". So I plan to split DCA in half and put in ETF and stocks equally. I also read about the [Enhanced DCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b40399/enhanced_dollar_cost_averaging/). Statistically, is the Enhanced DCA worth a try?

All suggestions are welcome. I'm happy to give more information and appreciate any help you can provide. :)",TSLA,Tesla

2024-12-03,20:49:45,investing,Investment Advice- Rebalancing?,"I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.

I'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.

My main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)

  
**Current Accounts and Savings:**

  
Personal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.

Business Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. 

SEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?

ROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.

M1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.

Regular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.

Chase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.

  
Crypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.

  
So my currently contributions to all my accounts are :

  
SEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  
ROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  
M1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  
Chase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  
Crypto- $400 DCA into BTC  


I don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.

I'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. 

TLDR: Please critique my current investment strategy, are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys/ DCA/ contributions more effectively?",TSLA,Tesla

2024-12-01,11:04:38,investing,A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry,"Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).

Tesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ""ate it's own cake too"" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).

2024-12-01,09:54:01,investing,Thoughts on Tesla in December,"So right after Tesla recently reached it's ath I made the decision to short it and I made some decent returns on that but already closed the position as Ibfelt like it was done with it's current correction.

But I still think the company is very overvalued. I would think 250 is a fair value or maybe even less. 

Let's be honest the overvaluation is due to people having strong feeling for Elon Musk not bcs the company has an economic moat.

So the question we need to ask ourselves is: will the postive sentiment end at any point in the near future and honestly I do not think so. Bunch of recent tweets were pretty controversial and all that but I feel like this won't have any further impact atm. I just read they are recently started production on the newest Y model and it's supposed to be available in early 2025 so this might actually push the price up until then.

2024-11-29,19:56:20,investing,Thesis: A Food  for Though on Fundamentals of TSLA in Relationship to the Era When Warren Buffet Was Born,"Hi investing friends, granted calculations say TSLA is overbought by around 7 to 8x  but if we go back in time and imagine it's today, could TSLA be at an era when it was good for Warren to buy Wrigley's stocks or Coca Cola stocks?

I get Buffett's picks which are first en masse, second they are consumables, 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster(nothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and there's nothing hard about chewing and drinking Coke), 4th don't require R and D at some point, I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.

Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).

2024-11-29,00:44:37,investing,Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

2024-11-29,00:12:45,investing,the TRUTH about investing no one tells you,"# 1. The system is rigged

The financial industry thrives on overcomplicating things to justify fees.

As Charlie Munger said:*""The whole damn system is corrupt... everyone wants easy money, fast. And that requires a big fee.""*

Think about it: there’s **$2 trillion** locked in mutual funds charging **2% fees** while underperforming cheap index funds like the S&P 500. Who’s really winning here? Hint: it’s not us.



# 2. Temperament beats intelligence

Investing isn’t about being the smartest—it’s about controlling your emotions.

* Warren Buffett: *""The most important quality is temperament, not intellect.""*
* I read a study of a fund that averaged an **18% annual return**, but the **average investor in that fund lost money** because they tried to time the market.

**Lesson:** Fear and greed will destroy your portfolio faster than any bad stock pick.



# 3. The S&P 500 is your cheat code

Here’s your free investing hack: **buy the S&P 500 and chill.**

* Low fees.
* Decades of growth.
* Outperforms **98% of funds** consistently.

Even Charlie Munger admits:*""Wealth managers have almost zero chance of beating an unmanaged index like the S&P.""*

So why do people chase stock-picking glory? Because too many investors confuse excitement with success.



# 4. Picking stocks is really hard

Think it’s easy to find the next Tesla? It’s not. And even if you do, good luck getting in before the hype.

* Buffett: *""If you can’t value the stock, you can’t invest in it. You can gamble on it, but you can’t invest.""*
* Most people buying stocks have never even read a balance sheet.

**Picking winners is possible, but it’s incredibly hard—think Charlie Munger-level hard.**

  
**What this all means**

The truth is, the game is rigged for most people to lose. But that doesn’t mean you can’t win.The winners aren’t the ones chasing hype stocks or flexing their ""10-baggers""—they’re the ones quietly compounding wealth by staying disciplined and focusing on what works: **consistency, patience, and a solid strategy.**

I have a high exposure to AAPL and it has served me well. With Apple Intelligence and general trend in tech stocks with AI boost, I still saw some upside and was thinking of holding for longer. But now what Trump won and tariffs are coming, I see Apple products becoming more expensive and taking a hit in sales in the US. 

Also, I feel Elon has had a tiff with Apple in the past with them pulling ads from Twitter/X, Elon trying to launch Tesla Phone and some history with Apple refusing to buy Tesla since Elon had put some shitty condition like he wants to be CEO of Apple as part of the deal.

Do you think Apple will likely see more downside with this Administration or will it likely be more or less the same fate as rest of the Tech stocks? Is Trump Victory ultimately agnostic to Apple's future?",TSLA,Tesla
2024-11-03,15:20:44,investing,The Contradiction of Warren Buffet's Avoidance of $TSLA,"Hi investing friends, helping fellow like-minded people (where's the trading/day trading swing tradaing sub-reddit of r/investing by the way?) add their fundamentals. I'm 93/7 percent believe in Warren and Elon, meaning if they say 100 things, I will most like believe 93 or them 110%:

Although Warren Buffett and we must always do our best to surpass our heroes like all Olympic records are meant to be broken (coz' in part technology, rule change and medicine advances) or NBA stars like MJ surpassing their heroes and Warren Buffett is still the genius compared to 93.% of investors and traders (the remaining 7% are the other stars like Peter Lynch), he's also made a few mistakes (Amazon is the best example coz' he always insists he doesn't understand technology which is honestly not that hard to understand but may be hard to see the road ahead when the internet was democratized including made affordable for the common working man with a decent salary ala Henry Ford's speech):

granted he loves CEOs and founders who have a laid back personality that are orthodox but orthodox in the big way, like Tim Cook, and granted TSLA is overbought by saying TSLA has the market cap of the auto industry combined vs. it's book value (math part of things, ruled by figures/number so it's more a part of technical analysis still), is he avoiding TSLA because:

a)  Elon Musk's personality is the biggest Think Big of all Think Bigs in the industrial history (way bigger than Henry Ford or Vanderbilt and the others who built industrial america which spilled to the world) and he's not comfortable with that

b) or is it because it's personal coz' they had a little war on words in the interviews and on X/formerly Twitter?

If it's about a) then it contradicts with his being on the Left mindset (a democrat, I'm with team common sense by the way at the moment coz' it has clarity, consistency and specific solutions) coz' the Left is very unorthodoxed and sometimes even comically non-sensical, going way beyond common sense.

If it's b) that's even worse, coz' one's judgment must not be clouded as Graham and Warren have though themselves, big decisions must be logical not ruled by vibes and emotions.

2024-11-01,11:09:44,investing,Need help regarding intrinsic value ,"So the stock in question is Tesla.

I have done lots of research into the company and it’s finances and have used multiple methods in order to determine an intrinsic value (including margin of safety) to find a nice entry price. The methods I have used are:

1) Discounted cash flow ($50.49)
2) Multiples valuation model ($31.81)
3) Graham’s valuation model ($179.41)

This is not to say that my valuations are correct by any means, and I accept there could be faults in my calculations. My concern is that Grahams valuation model has produced the highest IV by some margin. However, it seems quite reasonable given how Tesla stock has traded over the last few years that this could be fairly accurate. I just want some advice on how people would use these numbers. Would you:

A- Use grahams alone as a benchmark for IV

B- Try and find an average between all 3 models and use that as an IV value ($81 would be the average), but at the risk that the stock may never drop as low as this so I may miss out on the stock altogether 

Edit- Please offer your advice, I am trying my best to learn and would be handy to see what other people do in this situation ",TSLA,Tesla

This is true with almost all earnings because, like sports betting, the more people who long a stock before earnings drives the price higher and for the market maker to break even they need to lose.

The more who sell before earnings drives the price lower and for market maker to break even it needs to drive the price higher.

2024-10-24,18:39:50,investing,PM was a good buy before earnings; but why?,"I just thought PM showed a good example that the price ""fell"" going into earnings and ends up pushing higher after earnings.

I would argue through much experience that this is typical in both directions. I therefore expect MSFT to do similar and META is a bit neutral.

The rationale is the price is moving against the direction of the bet to increase the cost of the bet. If you know how betting works that's exactly how it works. Look at the presidential election bets on polymarkets - Trump is more expensive to bet yes (win) than Kamala.

How does price moving down mean a more expensive upside bet? Simple, the price has to move MORE to break even or be profitable for a trader. This phenomenon is OPPOSITE to gambling such as sports betting. Which can be explained by how the payout works, because the payout isn't a pot of money but a share that then has to be sold by the counterparty (a short seller against a long buyer).

What does this have to do with investing? I think a lot of people get this backward. They buy a stock ahead of earnings anticipating good earnings (or sell it anticipating bad) and then the stock does the opposite of what they expect for a time, sometimes even a little after the earnings volatility is crushed.

Some people just hold through this ""volatility"" and never seem to figure out why it happens in the first place. But others get absolutely discouraged at timing their buying of shares of their stock and end-up buying in a suboptimal way; such as DCA'ing on the way up.

I bought PM right before earnings because it moved down and I knew that for everyone to lose price had to move up; that is where the ""bet"" breaks even. And sure enough it did.

I like PM as a company, I expected its earnings to be good so I expected that tailwind anyway. But I timed my buy to a price of $114.62 with options.

So I had a massive advantage going into the earnings purchase to stack my PM shares.

Lastly; I wanted to point out that I bought PM very confidently because of pre-earnings behavior that PM would go up even though I think to an untrained eye PM looks ""weak"" coming off an all time high and they would therefore assume it'd continue to be weak. That going any higher would seem ""too much"".

Growth Discovery? Check.

Capital and Income? Check.

Total Market Index? Check.

These three 'diversified' funds were in fact not very diversified at all.

Not sure if I liquidate the growth discovery and capital/income funds and just pile the procedes into the index fund.

I also have small cap index, medium cap index and an international index, but those above three funds are close to 40 percent of my Fidelity portfolio.

* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.
* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.
* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.
* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.
* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.
* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.

ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:

**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN

* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:
* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here.
* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).
* 15% mix of these...
   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation
   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large
   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership
   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership
   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership
   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now
* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.
* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.

**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR

* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play.
* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.
* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.

**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR

* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:
* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.
* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.
* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.

**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.

ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.

   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large
   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership
   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership
   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership
   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now
* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.
* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.

**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR

* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play.
* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.
* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.

**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR

* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:
* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.
* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.
* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.

**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.

ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.

But every few months I get the urge to sell a part of it and gamble in individual stocks. I did that with Tesla in 2018 (yes it was kind of a gamble then) and that paid off, a few others paid off too but then some didn’t pay off. Overall, am I beating the market? - I am not sure with rollovers from one job to the next that don’t keep track of previous account gains. But I am not loosing either with the strategy. How do you keep this urge/itch away? Just keeping it in S&P 500 is so boring. 

EDIT: based on comments I want to add that I do gamble in casinos table games but not more than $500-$1000 a year. It’s fun but I have the thinking that I will loose that 100%. The high from stocks which is 1k-10k gain in a short time is at another level. I don’t bet on penny stocks.

I would like to be a discussion on benefits of selling/holding long positions that are up significantly. I’m sure there are others in similar positions who may want to know.

I have been long on both these for a handful of years.

NVDA - 119.75 Shares @ $55.26 Avg Cost.

My unrealized gains are getting up there. What’s invested in these + the unrealized gains are just over 1/3 of my portfolio. I am unsure if I should sell my positions and buy back in. Albeit at a higher price..seems kind of silly. I know it’s unlikely these will “crash” even a considerable market adjustment wouldn’t really affect my positions since I got in “early”. I am just nervous having all these unrealized gains. 

I don’t have to pay tax on these gains until sold, so I have been leaning to just letting it be and (hopefully) continue to grow. These companies have been beating earnings every quarter with no real tell tale signs of slowing…(maybe I’m wrong)

2024-10-05,19:12:12,investing,American Funds generally exclude Nvidia. So disappointing.,"I inherited a sizable Roth IRA, and looked at the portfolio composition and was disappointed that Nvidia is not even a part of many of their funds.

The 4 funds that are in the portfolio have such a large overlap, it makes no sense why the financial planner would do this. The expense ratios are extremely high, and the holdings make no sense either:

[American Balanced Fund® (ABALX)](https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/investments/fund/ABALX) mostly Microsoft, Broadcom, and Google

[Capital Income Builder® (CAIBX)](https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/investments/fund/CAIBX) mostly Broadcom, Phillip Morris, and Abby Vie

[The Growth Fund of America® (AGTHX)](https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/investments/fund/AGTHX) mostly Microsoft, Meta, and Google (AHA...Nvidia is actually in there, but only at 3.5% of the fund)

[The Investment Company of America® (AIVSX)](https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/investments/fund/AIVSX) Microsoft, Broadcom, Microsoft, Google, Meta.

The amount of money that was ""lost"" by not having more more exposure to nvidia is absurd. Why don't their funds just track the S&P 500?

I plan to hold onto this Roth for the next 10 years, let it grow, then make a lump sum RMD, but I am very upset over the high expense ratios of about 0.63%.

I am considering selling these positions and buying just one good one that has more of nvidia. I really don't like these expense ratios and it almost feels like extortion.

2024-09-24,22:26:23,investing,What some network effect business you invest?,"“The network effect is a business principle that illustrates the idea that when more people use a product or service, its value increases.”

The Network Effect Defined

The network effect is a business principle that illustrates the idea that when more people use a product or service, its value increases. The network effect significantly applies to digital platforms, dating all the way back to the internet itself. When the internet became more widely used, more people relied on it to conduct work, deepen personal connections, and for research and other functions.

Example: social network platforms

The network effect is especially prominent on online platforms that encourage users to add other users to the platform’s network. Social networks such as Facebook and Instagram are key examples of the network effect. The more people that use the platform in an individual’s network, the more likely it is that individual will use the platform, too.

Example: E-commerce platforms 

E-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, also benefit from the network effect. As more retailers opt to sell their goods on Amazon, the more consumers will look to Amazon to shop. The reverse is also true.

2024-08-28,23:20:51,investing,How do you do a proper research on a company?,"I am trying to level up my game, and for a pretty long time I just looked at the balance sheet, a few ratios, P/E, forward P/E, compared these to the industry average, healthy cash flow, debt etc. Most of the time I just did this on well known stocks, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, INTC, AMD, META etc. basically companies you hear about a lot everywhere, I just had no trust in lesser known companies to outperform the market, even if these basic metrics were promising.

Now it worked out relatively well since I started investing, but I feel like I didn't really beat the market by too much with my stock picks given the extra risk I took. There was a study by [Cornell](https://www.cornell-capital.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-Q2-Memo.pdf?_bhlid=91b22f94067500de4f838bfb72c6cdab059cf3dc), where one of the graphs show the % of SP500 stocks beating the SP500, and while the data doesn't go back too much -would love to see one that goes back until 1970-1980 at least-. however for the 2014-2023 period it can be seen that about 40-50% of the companies beat the 'market'. So basically if you stock pick with a random generator you have a good chance to have a similar performance to the market. So I believe with a proper educated research it would be possible to tip the scales in our favor.

So I feel like the way I picked stocks was sort of look at the most hyped and known companies, have a basic glance on some ratios and the balance sheet, and I feel like this is so bad that it will bite back after a while. I see quite a few people here on reddit and some other communities knowing so much about a company, the moat they have, why it's a good investment, why it would be a bad one etc. What is the proper approach to get information? What sources are valuable? I assume earning reports are one, but I doubt they have all the information of the industry the company is in, why it's better than competitors etc. surely there are some other sources that are used for all this.

2024-08-28,19:27:53,investing,Call me crazy but ROI on AI is already good,"AI investments are proving their worth faster than many expected, especially for tech giants like Facebook (Meta). In 2022, hyperscalers saw their Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) dip as they ramped up AI spending. However, the latest data shows that their ROICs have already largely recovered outside of MSFT, even as they continue to grow their capital expenditures. If ROIC across the board continued to drop as capex has increased over the past 3 years these arguments about AI needing to move the needle may have some merit but that has not been the case.

[https://imgur.com/a/Npft53D](https://imgur.com/a/Npft53D)

This quick turnaround highlights how effective AI is in driving value, not just hype. Take Facebook as an example. By integrating AI into their ad services, Facebook dramatically improved ad targeting and personalization, directly boosting ad performance and revenue. The optimization of AI-driven ad placements allowed them to deliver better results for advertisers, which translated into higher prices per ad and improved ad load efficiency. This AI-driven approach is a clear demonstration of how AI investments can rapidly translate into tangible financial benefits, reinforcing the high ROIC we are seeing across the board.

Got lots of great feedback, and now that I have digested it all - I'm looking to move on some of it and hoping for some followup great advice on how to best handle.  The gist of it was:

  
*$5M portfolio, heavily weighted in AAPL and TSLA (80%) with $1M cash. Commenters suggest diversifying into index funds or bond funds, considering the tax implications of selling stocks, and caution against over-reliance on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios due to its high cash allocation. Some recommend exploring municipal bonds for tax efficiency and using a more conservative investment strategy given my financial situation.*

What I've started the process of doing is moving some of the cash to VOO, VXUS and VXF at a 50/25/25 split.  I feel confident with that mix and my goal of turning this $5M into $10M in \~10 years seems possible.  That just leaves the stocks and figuring out how to best convert those over into the 3 funds.  Am I right in assuming that there is really no real trick to this other than to sale them at the rate of taxes I'm willing to incur each year?  Much of the AAPL and TSLA holdings are profit so they are gonna hit me the hardest.  If I'm right in that assumption - what not just pull the bandaid off and do them all now?  Is there any real benefit to doing them over several years?  I don't plan on selling everything, but do want to move the bulk of stuff to those 3 funds.",TSLA,Tesla

I spoke with my adviser at Schwab today because I'm ready to redirect my monthly SIMPLE IRA contributions (\~$2666/month for my wife and me) from buying stocks to something else. He suggested the Schwab Intelligent Portfolio, which seems like a good fit. I've also been reading about the 3-fund portfolio.

So, with all that in mind, I have a few questions:

I’ve been hip to investing for a few years now, loading up $50 here and there in companies like Tesla, Nike, Apple… you know the big companies. 

But I had several realizations as I’ve been continuously studying investing.

1. I DONT KNOW WHAT I AM DOING! $50 here and there into the companies I named is BS. I learned just because a company is in the news often doesn’t necessarily mean they have good financials (they turn a profit, steady growth, etc) 

2. NO STRUCTURE: $50 here and there is NO structure what so ever. I want to get to a place where I can invest $250 EVERY MONTH (I’ll work my way up as my income increases) not just 3 or 7 months the year but 12 months. I want investing to be apart of my monthly budget and I’m serious about that expense just like I am my rent / car note. 

3. NO STRUCTURE (Continued): there’s no portfolio management, I don’t have a solid investment strategy.

So in a nut shell, I’m investing all wrong. I’m proud of my self for taking the steps to invest because majority of my blood line doesn’t invest but I am one of the ones that isn’t scared, I want to seek out the necessary information, and I want to apply it. 

So that being me to my questions.

• how do I find a solid investment advisor/ CFA? 
• what exactly do I look for? I’m sure there’s some bullshit advisors out there and I want to make SURE I don’t run into one. My generational wealth depends on the quality of my advisor. I’m just not sure how to do due diligence to even find the right person. This is way out of my arena. 

If anyone can offer advice, insight, recommendations, it would be much Appreciated.

2024-08-03,15:33:02,investing,Looking to pick myself up and make a long time investment strategy after years of investing poorly,"In December of 2019 and somewhere around 2022 I invested about 6-7k each time in a few choice stocks. Since I was younger, I felt like I could totally be an investment guy, and keep track of everything that's happening. Since then I learned that I'm 100% not that guy and I want a somewhat simple investment strategy that I can buy and forget with, for a long period of time (5+ years at the very minimum).

I've made some horrible choices like investing in SVB, TEAM and FVRR, but made some excellent choices (IMO) in META, CRWD and GOOGL. I find that I'm (obviously) much more comfortable with blue chip stocks, but I don't trust that investment strategies such as DCA work on individual stocks so much as they work on ETFs.

I'm a techy guy so I mainly invest in tech. I'm perfectly fine in investing into S&P, NASDAQ and another ETF for the rest of my life, but I already have my pension and another investment fund through my job 100% in S&P, and I don't know if it's wise doing my personal in S&P as well (of course, I have many stocks in the S&P in my portfolio).

Since these 2 investments, I have kept my money in a very low risk, low reward fund that basically just keeps the money from not losing it's value over time. I'm looking into investing it in the market between now and the following 12 months. I don't know how much of my portfolio I want in individual stocks and how much in ETFs. Makes sense to me that considering what I'm looking for, it should be at the very least 70% in ETFs. By the way, does it make sense owning ETFs and also individual stocks from these ETFs?

Just as a disclaimer, I will never just outright do any advice I'm given. I'm a cautious person, and will always do my research based on other's advices.

Just a background: I'm 27, living with my girlfriend in Israel, making about 5.5k net USD a month. I think I can invest about 50% of that each month (on average) considering all of our expenses. My objectives are potentially buying an estate somewhere abroad and retiring early (earlier than the retirement age here which is 67 currently). No debt. In my fund I'm at -18%, mostly because of SVB and a few poor choices. I'm thinking of just selling all of these bad choices just to forget about them, and taking that money elsewhere. Let me know what you think.

So anyway, I hope I've provided everything necessary. Let me know if I missed some vital information.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2024-08-01,20:11:55,investing,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

2024-07-16,06:01:22,investing,"1 Is there a process by which info about a stock goes from insider knowledge to widespread knowledge, and how that relates to bubbles?","Warren Buffet once said something like 'be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy'

There is also the shoeshine boy effect of Joe Kennedy. Supposedly when Joe Kennedy started getting stock tips from his shoeshine boy, that is when he knew it was time to leave the market. Supposedly he just made this story up to cover for insider trading, but its still a good lesson.

I feel like a stock goes through certain steps. At each step the potential gain goes down while the potential losses go up. Is there a name for this process?

FWIW my money is in index funds, so I don't really know a lot about the psychology of the stock market.

But it would go something like this

- step one. Only insiders who work in the industry have specialized knowledge and they can use that knowledge to buy low. This would be examples of insider trading (which is illegal) or politicians like Nancy Pelosi buying stocks based on confidential government information about government policy related to publicly traded companies (which is legal, but should be illegal).

- Knowledge that is public, but is very esoteric and hidden. There is knowledge out there about a new technology, new policy, etc that will affect the stocks price but the only people that know about it are experts in the field. Its public knowledge, but only a handful of experts know the info.

- Knowledge that is public and fairly well known. Basically anyone with google can find the knowledge.

- Knowledge that is mainstream. The mainstream media reports on the knowledge.

- Knowledge that causes hype. I guess an example of this would be NVIDIA or Tesla. After a while there was massive hype in these companies, and the stock prices didn't reflect their P/E ratios. At this point the general public who have no knowledge of stocks jumps on the bandwagon and ends up losing money when the stock crashes. NVIDIA hasn't crashed, but it might. 

With each step, the knowledge of the stock becomes more public and the less informed the investors become. 

Its not a perfect system by any means. Bitcoin went through the last phase of the general public jumping on the bandwagon and crashed in 2021, but it recovered from the crash and is now worth more than it was in 2020. However bitcoin only went above its 2021 peak in the last few months. Bitcoin peaked at 61k in October of 2021, crashed, and only went back up to 62k in June of 2024.

But stocks like Tesla did drop after they became mainstream 'good ideas' to buy for uninformed investors. However Tesla has had both dips and peaks since it lowered from its peak.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-07-15,16:41:00,investing,Active IRA management vs index funds and ETFs?,"I’m curious to know where people stand on whether they think they should place their own trades in IRA accounts vs buying index funds and etfs. I’m on the side of active only because I know what I’m doing especially during high volatility when I’m able to pick up stocks at lower prices during or after selloffs. This concentrated buying has allowed me to see pretty big upside when the stock rebounds especially if it rises more than the index. The risks of this is that SPY/QQQ has been rising consistently. I have been really conservative about buying tech thinking the market will pull back and I have missed out big as a result. My YTD would be around 30-40% if I didn’t sell my positions early but that’s life. 

Me (Roth IRA): 19.35% YTD

My 401k: 15.27%

S&P: 18.61% YTD

Nasdaq 100: 20.83% YTD

My biggest winners include

-RKLB. 37.92%. $4.05. I think this is a 5-10 year play. I buy on dips. I’m too afraid to sell covered calls on this for fear of the price running without me.

-Arm bought near 52 week low and sold around $80 thinking it was overvalued… I bought back with a small stake at $120 begrudgingly only to see it rise to $170.

-hood. Bought at $8, sold for $9.50…. Thought it would keep ping ponging. Bought back at $20 and will average down if need be but the company is not going out of business

-rivn. Up 35% YTD, my biggest position. I bought slightly high but kept averaging down. I actually believe in the company. Cost basis $12.94.

-aapl. Up 20% YTD. I have a small stake because I kept waiting for Apple to drop to $130 before rising to $200 which did not happen. Cost basis $195.

-Bcrx. Up 58% YTD. I’ve known this bio company for almost a decade now. They ping pong so it’s mostly cyclical. $4.65 cost basis 

-cava. Up 26% YTD. Kicking myself for not buying more. 

-SG. Bought at like $9, sold at like $13. Kicking myself. I bought after reading about their subscription service and seeing how people are paying $20 for their orders

-FBTC. Up 16.98%. Cost basis $47.14. Bitcoin is here to stay like it or not. Wish I didn’t penny pinch when trying to buy 100 shares of MSTR 2 years ago for $500. 

-HUM. +19.52%, $323.75. Healthcare is expensive and this company is not going out of business so I buy dips.

-KWEB. +17.52%, $23.90. China will rebound, well at least Chinese tech. 

-Lmnd. +25.08%, $16.16. Saw a report on their business model and it gives headaches but can work if they survive the growing pains. I think they are here to stay and will probably get to $60 in the next 5 years.

-Meta. +19.29%, $420. I actually bought Meta at $115 during the crazy but got spooked when it dropped below $110, I sold for a profit but kicked myself for not holding. I believe in the company and they are just getting started revenue wise in my opinion. So many AI plays here. Regretting not having the cash to load up this time around. 

-NFTY. +15.23%. $53.77. India will probably keep growing. This stock also pays a good dividend. 

-RBRK. +13.75. $30.83. Cybersecurity is growing. I also have positive numbers in Palo Alto which I buy on earnings drops

-snap. +42.52%. $11.33. Snap is not going out of business. The stock drops after earnings so I just buy then and wait for a rebound. It’s one of my largest holdings. Wish I dumped more cash and wish it would drop when the market drops but it’s held firm the last few months

-Z. +23.83%. $40.83. Bought during the sell off when the courts ruled against the industry. Zillow will be fine. 


I actually don’t have many losers. The stakes are small.

-Aal. -14.41%. $12.54. I think it will bounce back in a year or two. 

-CGC. -15.33%. $7.52. I don’t know much about weed but figured I’d buy a small stake just in case.

-MSOS. -14.19%. $8.70. Small stakes in weed, lottery ticket

-WBD. -15.88%. $8.66. The worst buy I’ve made. Figured might as well keep it.

-Snow. -13.67%. $154.53. I knew I was buying high with snowflake but didn’t expect the big drop. The stake is not big. I still do believe in the company.

-Dis. -9.94%. $107.54. Knew I was buying high, my fault really. Thankfully not a big position and Disney will bounce back.

-Hubs. -17.29%. $570.91. Tiny stake. I actually like the current price and will buy around $420.

-CMG. -7.08%. $61.36. Knew I was buying high but long term hold.

-PZZA. -7.84%. $45.74. One of my larger stakes. Papa John’s is at a 4-5 year low which is crazy to me since their numbers are not bad. It’s a cyclical play if you look at the chart. Plus the company is not going out of business. Worst case scenario is this drops to high $20s which do don’t know how that can even happen. I’ll keep buying weekly. ",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2024-07-13,07:44:33,investing,What is biggest risks to Yield Max ETF?,"I trade actively (futures/options) and have different accounts for different reasons (i.e: long term/IRA/401K/day trading/swing trading/YOLO account as well) so my financial literature is relatively well, but I still dont see the biggest risks to yield max ETF, which is selling covered calls and selling cash secured puts on many famous stocks such as TSLA/NVDA

Those have good return, so I have been buying IRA, since taxes wont apply until withdrawal in retirement. 

  
I understand how they will pay out the dividend in theory and actually I use similar strategy in SPY but whats the biggest risk here? 

My best guess is that individual stocks goes to 0, by which Yield Max ETF will go into 0, but it's hard to imagine that NVDA will go to 0 in any time soon, since they are dealing with big tech or big name stocks with good financial statement and pretty much too big to fail business (i.e: DIS/JPM) 

That makes me think there is virtually no risks but apparently, it sounds too good to be true, and I am getting cautious. Are there anything I should know on this kind of ETFs?

Thanks to these developments, Tesla surged over 10% on Tuesday, with its market value reaching $737.5 billion, maintaining a six-day rally, and breaking another resistance level, which is always a bullish sign. From April's low, Tesla shares are now up 67%.

**Q2 Deliveries Slightly Exceed Expectations Amid Record June Deliveries from Chinese EV Makers, Zero-Interest Car Purchases Expected to Drive Crazy Q3 Demand**

According to Tesla's delivery data released on Tuesday, the company delivered 440,000 new vehicles in Q2, down 4.8% year-over-year but up 15% quarter-over-quarter, and better than the market's expectation of 439,300 vehicles. The total production in Q2 was about 411,000 cars, resulting in a delivery-production gap of 33,000 cars, compared to -46,000 cars in the previous quarter (where more cars were produced, leading to some inventory remaining). Tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of German factories and the Red Sea conflict, which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short-term supply struggles to meet demand, which is obviously more exciting than excess supply.

Considering that Chinese EV makers such as NIO, ZEEKR, and Leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in June, this implies a significant recovery in demand for Tesla. The company also launched a major campaign on Monday, introducing five-year zero interest financing for Model 3/Y and other preferential policies.

Specifically, users who place an order before and including July 31 can avail themselves of a no-down-payment deal: with an initial down payment of 79,900 yuan (10,990 dollars), the daily installment for the Model 3 RWD and Long Range AWD will be as low as 85 yuan and 107 yuan respectively (12 and 15 dollars for each), while the Model Y RWD and Long Range will be as low as 95 yuan and 118 yuan per day. Users who make a down payment of 45,900 yuan (6,300 dollars) can opt for a five-year low-interest plan (starting at an annualized rate of 0.93%).

The Chinese market accounts for about 22.5% of Tesla's revenue, and if this measure is implemented in other countries in the future, it would indeed be a massive move. This also adds a new narrative for Tesla's Q3 growth.

**Energy Storage Deployment Doubles, Benefitting from AI Era**

Both NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have pointed out that the future development of artificial intelligence is closely related to energy and storage. While Tesla's AI business has yet to show tangible benefits, its energy storage business is poised to become a pillar of AI in the future.

Tesla reported that it deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products in Q2, setting a new record for quarterly deployment, more than double the 4 GWh in Q1, and the company's energy storage deployments in the first half of the year almost matched the total for last year.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas praised, ""As Gen AI acceleration spurs a multigenerational increase in energy demand, electricity generation, and data center investment, we believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy, which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business is uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the U.S. electric grid accelerated by the AI boom.""",TSLA,Tesla
2024-07-02,23:15:07,investing,Diversify once you hit a gain % threshold?,"Hey everyone, I’m 25M and have been putting all my spare money after expenses into the stock market. I only had to pay half of my college so that was really helpful but I’ve been working a lot of jobs and internships since 16 which helped too.

So I started investing 7 years ago and have seen an annualized return of 16.1%. I bought Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and others in the first couple years and have seen incredible returns from them. 

My question is if you would recommend I diversify any of my gains. For example I put 1k into Nvidia and now it’s around 10k. But now my stock portfolio is not that diversified because of some large gains between a few stocks I have are holding all the weight. Is there a threshold in the gain % where you start taking out and diversifying? For example, if I make 500% return on a given stock, anything over I would invest in something else.

2024-06-27,00:44:53,investing,Safe starting plan to get into Futures? As well as what to do with my ROTH? ,"Hello all, I am very confused on how to proceed from the position I am in, and so would really really appreciate some advice. I am 19 years old.

Firstly, for some background, I started trading maybe back in 2022, I put in about $2500 in a WeBull trading account and invested in a bunch of big names like AAPL, TSLA, LMT, etc. And I invested some money into some complete no name stocks that I saw on TikTok. By what I would imagine to be completely luck, these stocks actually did quite well and they have been in the green for some time now. But yes, I know not to take advice from TikTok lol.

Fast forward to now, I havent touched the account since then, and opening it I have made a return of about 16% with about $400 in total open P&L. Which I feel like is good? maybe? I don't know.

Anyways the reason I'm making this post is because I'm interested in short term profits, I have always wanted to get into options but to be honest it just seemed very tricky and like gambling, and so it's always been a ""I'll learn how to get into it later"", but a few days ago I heard about something called futures trading and it seems much more simple and I would like to get into it. I have a very superficial understanding of how it works, and so I was just hoping to ask a couple questions about it:

1. Should I trade futures through a prop firm? Especially if I am just starting out/don't have a trading strategy? Or would I be better off starting with micros & my own money?
2. On that note, how do I go about developing a trade strategy? Do I just watch a YT video on different strategies available and pick one? My friend told me all strategies will work if I just use discretion but tbh that just made me more confused lol
3. What should I use to trade futures? I have heard that Ninjatrader is good.

And the next topic comes to my Roth IRA through Fidelity. over the course of a few months back in 2022 I put $200 in it monthly and eventually stopped, mainly because I was confused what ETFs I should put my money in.

People have told me VOO > SPY, but then some others said $FXAIX > $VOO. Which, if any, is true? Should I invest in all 3? Also, is $200 a month enough? Should I aim to max for $6500 contributed annually? Does it really matter?

I realize this post is all over the place and I apologize, but it's all the more reason I would appreciate some answers and so that I know where to go moving forward. Thank you very much!!!!",TSLA,Tesla
2024-06-26,02:29:40,investing,Top Names to Invest in the Metaverse ,"- Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Formerly known as Facebook, Meta Platforms Inc. is at the forefront of the metaverse revolution. With its rebranding, Meta signaled a strategic pivot towards building the metaverse. The company is investing heavily in VR and AR through its Oculus division, aiming to create immersive social experiences. Meta's vast user base and financial resources position it well to capitalize on the metaverse's potential. The company has pulled back on its plans to invest $10 billion into the space as the cost of the AI race has increased, leading META to reinvest in other areas. Still, the company is a safe way to play the metaverse trend.  

- Roblox Corporation (RBLX) Roblox is a platform that allows users to create, share, and experience games and virtual worlds. It has a massive and engaged user base, particularly among younger demographics. Roblox's user-generated content model is a microcosm of the broader metaverse vision, where users can build and monetize their virtual experiences. The company's innovative approach and strong community make it a compelling investment in the metaverse space. 

- Unity Software Inc. (U) Unity is a leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content. Its software is widely used in gaming, architecture, engineering, and construction. As the metaverse expands, the demand for tools to create 3D environments and experiences will grow. Unity's robust development ecosystem and cross-industry applications position it well to benefit from the metaverse's development. 

- Matterport (MTTR) Matterport is a compelling metaverse play due to its cutting-edge technology in 3D spatial data capture and digital twin creation. The company's platform enables users to create highly detailed and immersive digital replicas of physical spaces, which are essential for building and populating the metaverse with realistic environments. Matterport's technology is widely applicable across various industries, including real estate, architecture, construction, and retail, offering significant growth potential as these sectors increasingly adopt virtual and augmented reality solutions.  

The metaverse represents a new frontier with the potential to transform numerous aspects of our lives. Investing in companies at the forefront of this technological evolution offers opportunities for substantial returns. As the metaverse continues to develop, the companies highlighted above are well-positioned to lead and capitalize on this exciting digital revolution. Whether through VR/AR innovations, powerful computing platforms, or immersive virtual experiences, these top names are paving the way in the metaverse, making them compelling investment opportunities for those looking to tap into the future of digital interaction.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

2024-06-19,03:01:44,investing,Selling NVDA with $1m gains,"I’ve decided I’m going to sell a portion of my Nvidia stock once I hit $1million profit. As of close today, I need an additional 22% increase to hit this threshold so it will likely happen before the end of the month or by the end of summer if things slow down/correct.    

A little back story, I bought my first shares in Feb  2017 for $2.77 and again in October for $4.86.  I’ve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because I thought GPUs would be needed for self driving cars.  Little did I know the Ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help Nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world.  

My total cost basis is $34k and I’m sitting right around $850k.  Gains are around 2600% which is insane.  

I still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I’m a bit torn on actually selling any of it.  If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned, well I wouldn’t be sitting on the gains I have today.  My gut is telling me to only sell 1/3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into.  I’m also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0% which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true FATfire setup.  As with any compounding interest, once the snowball gets to this point, smaller 2-5% moves really move the needle (in both directions).  

Anyways, just want to share this with someone since I can’t really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship.  It’s anyone’s real guess what will happen with Nvidia in the future so I can’t imagine anyone can persuade me one way or another on this trade.  I’ve experienced similar gains on Tesla but failed to sell at the top and now only have a portion of my gains on that stock so I know when a bubble feels like a bubble and this is definitely in that territory now.

Whether NVDA is overvalued or not is up for debate, I have been hearing on Youtube that NVDA will drop after stock split just like TSLA did.  Let’s look into some figures for comparison:

regarding NVDA, the current market capitalization as of June 2024 is around $3T. This valuation makes NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world by market cap, even higher than the peak valuation of over $1 trillion for TSLA.

In October 2021, TSLA PE ratio was quite high, reflecting its growth expectations and market enthusiasm. The PE ratio was around 250.96 at the end of September 20211, and it likely remained in a similar range throughout October. The forward PE ratio, which is based on projected earnings, was also elevated, indicative of the optimism about the company's future performance.

As for NVIDIA, as of today, the current PE ratio is approximately 77.182. The forward PE ratio, which considers expected future earnings, is around 46.823 (TSLA at its peak:67.57). These values suggest that investors are expecting strong growth from NVIDIA as well.",TSLA,Tesla

2024-06-11,01:47:25,investing,Fiverr - An unfairly beaten down 'pandemic stock'? An Investment Thesis for what currently looks like a contrarian bet. ,"# Context

A lot of pandemic era stocks lacked basic unit economics, and were found out when the funding stopped and subsequently collapsed.

Some had network effects / unit economics, but needed to ‘get fit’ (think Uber and Meta), some have righted their mid-pandemic wrongs with clear turnaround / value creation plans and been rewarded (think Carvana), and some have righted the wrongs but not yet been rewarded. I think **Fiverr ($FVRR)** sits in this latter category.

Fiverr is a leading freelance marketplace which connects businesses with freelancers offering a wide range of services.

# About the company

Founded in 2010 by Micha Kaufman and Shai Winiger in Tel Aviv, Fiverr operates a two-sided marketplace matching small businesses with freelancers.

With approximately 700 employees, Fiverr is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ($FVRR) and had a market cap of just under $1 billion in June 2024, down from about $11 billion during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Problem statement Fiverr solves**

Fiverr transforms the opaque and inefficient process of hiring freelancers into a modern, user-friendly e-commerce experience.

**Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**

Fiverr offers an easy-to-use platform where people can buy and sell small services for a flat starting fee. The platform boasts a comprehensive catalogue of services and well-vetted freelancers.

**Potential sources of network effects:**

* **Buyers**: Around 4 million buyers, with approximately 65% of core marketplace revenue from repeat buyers, indicating sustained user engagement.
* **Service Categories**: Over 700 freelance service categories, including recent additions like AI content and development. Gigs range from $5 to $50,000.
* **Freelancers**: Approximately 400,000 active freelance sellers.

# Investment Thesis

**Star Company**

Fiverr operates in a profitable and growing market niche (SMB freelance digital services) with growth exceeding 10% per year. It is a leader in its niche, matching freelancers to smaller SMEs effectively. This makes it a ‘Star Company’.

# Reasons why I think the stock will rise:

1. **Overly Beaten-Down Tech Stock**: Fiverr, has seen its share price decline by over 90% from its February 2021 peak. This significant drop – which has also recently been exacerbated by the geopolitical concerns in Israel and Palestine and the disruptive impact of AI on its business – is a common trend among tech stocks that were COVID-19 beneficiaries. What seems to have been overlooked is Fiverr retains a very viable and growing business post pandemic.
2. **Shift to Profitability and Cash Generation**: Fiverr’s growth has slowed to approximately 10% year-over-year as it has pivoted its focus towards profitability and cash generation, addressing investor demand for a focus on fundamentals. This strategic shift is reflected in improved bottom-line results, including free cash flow (FCF) and earnings per share (EPS), underpinned by key performance indicators like higher average ticket sizes and growing gross margins.
3. **Attractive Valuation Metrics**: Following recent share price pressures, Fiverr currently trades at a 2024 forecast earnings/enterprise value multiple that is attractive (c. 8.6x) given its 10% growth rate and acceleration in key value creation metrics, including EPS, FCF per share, and return on invested capital (ROIC).
4. **AI concerns appear overblown**: Investors are concerned AI will disrupt the services provided by freelancers on Fiverr’s platform, but Fiverr’s Q1 2024 results exceeded expectations, leading to raised guidance for the full year. Management has highlighted the net positive impact of AI on the business.
5. **Stable Take Rate and Financial Resilience**: Fiverr’s take rate remains stable at 30%, it has a $304m net cash position, and the company is free cash flow positive, providing significant financial resilience. I.e. it has gotten beyond ‘default alive’.
6. **Dynamic Macro Environment**: While the macroeconomic environment remains challenging with constrained budgets in large enterprises and financial pressures on small businesses, Fiverr’s high exposure to smaller businesses positions revenues to rebound quickly as conditions improve.
7. **Share Buyback Program**: In May 2024, Fiverr initiated a $100 million share buyback program, reflecting management’s belief that the stock is undervalued. They are confident in their cash position and free cash flow generation to support this initiative.
8. **Large Short Float:** The short float was around 10% as of June 2024, indicating the possibility of large upwards price moves if sentiment on the stock changes, as I think it should.

Overall, Fiverr’s strategic focus on profitability, robust financial health, and proactive management of market challenges make it a compelling investment opportunity.

# Things I Don’t Like About the Stock

1. **Share-Based Compensation (SBC):** The level of share-based compensation appears excessive and results in significant dilution. Deducting SBC from free cash flow results in a near zero number, meaning free cash flow per share is not trending up as quickly as desired.
2. **AI Cannibalization threat**: AI has the potential to cannibalize certain services offered on Fiverr, such as logo design and article writing, which could impact revenue.
3. **Buyer Trends**: While the number of buyers has been declining, this has been offset by an increase in the average purchase price. This trend is concerning and needs to be monitored.

Overall - looks like a decent buy at current prices. It currently trades at $24.5. Analyst expectations are $26 on the low end and $45 at the high. My target is late $30s

I placed a limit buy order at $24.5, which filled last night. At the same time I also took a position in Upwork, which has the same business model but is focussed on larger customers and is perhaps better equipped for AI implementation type services.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

2024-06-09,03:57:10,investing,Why is there such risk aversion?  98% VOO +2% high-risk outperforms with minimal risk or volatility?  (Genuine question!),"I don't know if it's the bubbles I'm in or what social media feeds me, but it seems like everyone is either a high-stakes crypto/AI gambler, or someone who only advocates dumping everything into a basic market index and leaving it forever.

I haven't used the particular tracker before, but I picked the default date ranges and just picked a couple of high-risk plays for a two percent allocation (Bitcoin and Tesla).  I think there's no denying these were highly volatile and highly-valued.  But even if they went to zero it would have a minimal impact on the portfolio.

But the returns were several percent better than VOO/SPDR.  And a 98% VOO +2% high-risk also outperforms BrkB, while being significantly more diversified.

I think anyone who's trying to ""play it safe"" would be ecstatic to beat the market by 3% by only risking 2% of their allocation.

(I haven't tried it but suspect you could have a portfolio of 70% bonds 30% high-risk and do well with a capped drawdown).

2024-06-05,18:20:34,investing,Musk/Tesla Insider trading question,"\*\*I am not promoting Tesla in any way. Reddit wouldn't give me any other flair options besides NSFW. Sorry.

Thanks to anyone who replies. I saw that Musk is apparently under fire for offloading $7.5B of stock (I think in 2022) during a time when he knew that the company wouldn't meet its targets. He also assured investors that it would be a great end to the year, despite knowing the opposite and selling stock.

I'm somewhat ignorant of the legal specifics, and I'm more curious about that than the actual Musk situation. I know insider trading is illegal, but if you're a CEO or other exec and you know your stock is about to take a hit, are you legally required to maintain your position and take the same proportional losses as any other investor?

Also, to avoid getting caught, why don't CEOs allow themselves to take very minor losses and then sell? I'm not advocating that, I'm just genuinely curious. It seems like a sketchy choice to sell so much stock without incurring losses when losses are incurred by others so shortly after. If a CEO rides a loss for just a little bit and **then** sells before everyone else (who lacks the CEO's insider knowledge) is that still insider trading?

  
Edit: On a scale of 1 (Rather Questionable) to 10 (Boldfaced Securities Fraud), how would you rank this situation? People seem to have mixed opinions. ",TSLA,Tesla

# 3 ways my investing evolved

I’m still well within the ‘maybe I’m just lucky’ phase since it’s only been a couple years, but I’ve noticed I invest differently now than I have in the past: 

1. Insight 
2. Conviction 
3. Patience

**Insight**

I’ve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views). 

Ben Graham’s quote rings true: 

>“In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”

Perhaps counterintuitively, I’ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers. 

Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both. 

# Math

In 2023 I also started practicing math daily (243 days straight as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I’d done any meaningful math. 

I’m not sure how much, but it *feels* like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not. 

**Conviction**

A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term. 

However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths. 

Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I’ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I’m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I’m happy I did. 

A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial. 

This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise, you must seize them.

**Patience**

As a result of my convictions, I’m much more patient in my investing these days and don’t react to the day-to-day. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if I don’t make another trade for the rest of 2024.

**UPDATE:**

A commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:

The previous 1 year update is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) Interestingly, the stock I lamented missing the run up on (Nvidia) is now by biggest holding and one of my best performers.

2024-06-02,17:32:25,investing,"How, and what are the best way to financially analyze growth companies? ","Hey folks! I have a question—how to analyze a growth company.
For example. How should we approach fundamentally, with companies that are literally creating the market (Apple back in the day, AirBnB, Coinbase, Tesla)? Or, rapidly expanding the market (NVIDIA with ai chips, energy companies that are investing in nuclear power plants).

In mature companies, it’s easy for us to value invest. But, growth investing..? I tried finding some things online but no luck yet.

I am assuming that the investor really needs to know the market in which the growth is happening to truly evaluate the potential of the company. For example.

2024-05-09,01:10:10,investing,NIO's Strategic Charge in the Global EV Market,"Investing in NIO, despite its current operational losses and significant debt levels, can be considered a forward-looking strategy, particularly for those who are bullish on the future of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable technologies. 

NIO's debt is largely a reflection of its aggressive investment in research and development, infrastructure, and expanding production capabilities. These investments are critical for gaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving EV market. By financing growth and innovation, NIO is positioning itself to capture a significant share of the global EV market, which is expected to grow substantially.  NIO is not just focusing on the Chinese market but is also eyeing expansion into Europe and potentially other international markets, giving it more growth opportunities.

The automotive industry is undergoing a significant transformation, moving away from fossil fuels to electric and hybrid vehicles. This shift is expected to continue due to the decreasing cost of batteries, improved EV infrastructure, and increasing societal awareness about climate change.

However the journey to other countries such as America does not come without challenges, especially with the  giant EV manufacturer Tesla running the show. Tesla has a strong brand presence in the U.S., recognized for pioneering the electric car industry and backed by high-profile CEO Elon Musk. Tesla's brand is associated with innovation, quality, and sustainability, aspects that resonate well with American consumers. NIO, while a recognized brand in China and some parts of Europe, would need marketing efforts to establish similar recognition in the U.S.  For NIO to compete effectively, it will need to differentiate its vehicles through unique features, possibly focusing on its innovative Battery as a Service (BaaS) model, advanced autonomous driving capabilities, and superior interior luxury, which are some of NIO's strong suits.

Tesla's extensive Supercharger network provides a significant competitive edge in the U.S., where infrastructure is a critical factor for EV adoption. NIO would need to either build its own charging infrastructure, form alliances with existing networks, or innovate around this challenge, perhaps by emphasizing its battery swap technology, which provides a full battery charge in a matter of minutes as opposed to longer charging times at a typical EV station.

Navigating the U.S. regulatory environment can be challenging, particularly for a foreign company amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over trade and technology transfer. NIO will need to manage these aspects carefully, ensuring compliance with U.S. regulations and possibly facing higher tariffs or trade barriers that could affect pricing and competitiveness.

2024-04-24,23:15:47,investing,Meta’s new AI feature looks kind of useless.,"I'm really impressed with Meta's smart moves in Virtual Reality and their big-picture thinking for the next decade. However, their decision to add large language models (LLMs) to apps like Instagram, Threads, Facebook, and WhatsApp has me scratching my head a bit.

Generally, people hop onto these platforms to chat and get entertained (Watch people get hit by cars on Instagram Reels), not for heavy-duty tasks like studying or research, which are typical uses for LLMs. Trying to do homework or deep dives into topics on a buzzing social media site? That sounds pretty distracting.

I think Meta could really hit it out of the park if they used LLMs to boost their advertising game instead. Imagine an LLM that helps advertisers craft killer campaigns or dig deeper into understanding their audiences. Sort of like Palantir’s software of gathering data and using an LLM to sort it and understand it better; but with consumers and their buying habits. That could really amp up what Meta offers to businesses and drive their growth much more effectively.

I still think META is a big buy since their forward PE is in the 20’s and Mark Zuckerberg has a great vision for the company, besides this move; Solid buy.

Recent developments reveal a general downturn across the sector, with Tesla, one of many players, implementing significant job cuts. The company has announced a reduction of over 14,000 jobs worldwide, particularly impacting its major operations in the U.S. and China.

Elon attributes these layoffs to a drop in sales and increasing competition in the EV market. This decision is reflective of broader challenges facing the industry, not just Tesla. A recent analysis indicates a significant reduction in job postings among leading EV manufacturers over the past three months. This trend could be an early indicator of the challenges that lie ahead for the sector, suggesting a possible reevaluation of growth strategies among these companies.

If it does, we’ll be having an interesting progress of :

- TSLA : will may be in the top 10; actually they’re selling the self driving as a subscription of 99$ monthly, what if every Tesla owner have this feature?

UBER : if Uber replace all drivers by self driving cars. They’ll be saving all payrolls and injecting it to develop other delivery business (could be drones delivery; maybe I went too far but it’s feasible).  There’s a lot of potential and whatever between 45$-55$ is a good buy price.

2024-04-16,16:26:20,investing,Is it Time to Bail on Apple?,"Was wondering what the sub thinks about holding AAPL at this point. I've had it since November, 2017 and it's up about 270% from when I bought it. At it's highest my gain was about 300%. It's down ~11% this year.

It just seems a bit saturated. iPhone is getting shellacked in China. They've got a great ecosystem of products and loyal customer base with one of the strongest brands in the world, but it feels like growth is limited.

Just wanted to see what everyone thinks. I know it's never a bad thing to sell and claim profits, but I know I'd kick myself if it did well later on. 

Also not sure where is a better place to park that money. I was thinking Netflix, it's been gangbusters recently, but the streaming market seems very iffy. I've got GOOG, NVDA, AMD, MA, V, MSFT, and META and not sure if I want to increase my exposure to any of those as well as they've done. 

Would be interested in people's opinions on AAPL and what might be a better investment for anyone souring on the company.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2024-04-14,18:52:25,investing,"10 years ago, we discussed how we select stocks. Here's the 2024 version.","Hi /r/investing, roughly 10 years ago there was a great discussion about [how we select our stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ecl4v/how_do_you_search_and_find_good_stocks/).  I discussed my method - Trending Value - and that led to me sharing my results with many of you via a program I had written.  Well, that program broke and remained dormant for years... until now.

So what is Trending Value?  It's a method published by James O'Shaughnessey in his ""What Works on Wall Street"" book. During decades of backtesting, it generated over 21% annual returns with equal standard deviation to the total market.  It generated a lot of discussion and lead to [this follow-up thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eyx3r/how_do_you_select_stocks_contd_trending_value_see/). In my mind, this method resonates the truest... far truer than those who advocate watching the check-out lines at your grocery store to see which products are being purchased. The method, summarizing is the following:

When you run a screen for stocks with good P/E or P/B, what do you look for? You find a stock with a P/E multiple of 12. Is this good? Is this bad? Neither and both, without a frame of reference. O'Shaughnessey's method rates 6 key financial metrics for every stock against the whole market to come up with a cumulative VALUE BASED score. Those metrics are: P/E, P/B, P/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, and Shareholder Yield, which is dividend yield + stock buyback yield (i.e. equity returned to the shareholder in some way).

All 6 metrics are ranked 0-100, where 100 is the ""best"" ratio in the stock universe, and 0 is the worst. The top 10% of stocks will typically have scores in the 420+ range. They are undervalued relative to the rest of the market.

However, just because a stock is undervalued DOES NOT mean that it's a good buy. It could be facing legal action, failing drug trials, having a CEO that just went to jail, or other event that can't be reflected in these numbers. That's where momentum comes into play.

We take the top decile of stocks and reorder them by 6-month price momentum. Invest equally in the top 25, hold for a year, liquidate, repeat. The companies you buy are undervalued and the market is rallying behind them. Back testing, while not a prediction of future results, yielded a 21.2% average ROI with this method.

Of course, there's no screener that does this, nor is there a way to even view ""Shareholder Yield"" in one location.

When I started this 10 years back, [I used MatLab to solve this problem](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46816-oshaughnessey_v5-m).  Yes, MatLab.  Wrong tool for the job.  Thankfully, ChatGPT has turned even amateur hobbyist coders into useful contributors, and a python version has been born.

I'll post the results of today's run below.  Feel free to ask for a specific stock and I'll post the results of that ticker.  Keep in mind, it is filtered to Market Cap > $200M and the name of the method is Trending VALUE - your growth stocks (NVDA, TSLA, etc) are going to be viewed very poorly.

Edit: You'll occasionally see a value like ""10000"" for P/E or another field.  That means the value was either missing or negative.  This is to artificially just kill that field for that ticker.",TSLA,Tesla

Took some gambles on small cap stocks and tech stocks, realized that wasn't for me. I'm a long term investor and most of my dividend stocks ended up performing better after 2022 decimated a lot of small caps stocks.  
  
Now, I'm deciding whether to add UNH, MCD, HD, or PEP.  
  
All of these stocks are between 200 to 500 a share though, so idk if I should add any or stay with what I currently got, or just put money into an index.  
  
My current best performing stocks are XOM, META, NFLX, V, DAL, MSFT  
  
Some of my failures have been: PAYC, GPS, ENPH, and TWLO.  
  
I like UNH because they along with Blue Cross form a duopoly in health insurance. However, the stock is around 450 so I could only get a few shares.  
  
MCD I'm worried about the rising prices of products.  
  
HD, I'm also worried about the rising interest rates making people less likely to flip and maintain their homes.  
  
Pepsi with KO also form a duopoly, but I think PEP has more brands that they can market that have room to grow. However, as a stock as a whole idk it will grow as much as even the index?",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

Then I look back at another position I started in 1997. Carlisle Companies.  Long term chart shows a split adjusted price of $0.71 in 1997.  Hard to believe.  
It hits home today because Intel has once again disappointed the market and is down 15% at the open.   Carlisle is up $12/share for some reason.  I point this out because, all too often, we concentrate on NVDA, TSLA and DIS, but the real wealth creation is in companies that we hardly know.

We’ve all heard the mantra “you’ll never beat the market” but is that really true any more or does the phrase need some sort of updating?

I’ve been investing for 15 years now and I think I be beat the market or at least the overall S&P500 every single year.  There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains, it’s significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S&P ETF.  My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I’ve always been higher…for over a decade now. 

So hear me out, I’ve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple: always invest in large cap stocks.  

With a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook (now meta), Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Amd, and a few others, I’ve found this sector completely destroys the overall “market.” Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart, it’s very aggressive and very heavily in tech.  

The difference in the S&P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I’ve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways, but I’m still beating the NASDAQ too.  

The contrarian’s argument is that given enough time, my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I’m up right now, for over a decade, that correction would have to be astronomical and I don’t see how the whole world economy wouldn’t fall if these tech picks crash down 50% at once.  

I’m not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that.  I’m just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market, and if so, what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I’m doing?

2024-03-31,03:50:29,investing,Frustrated with the amount of scammers in the financial space,"Hello,

It feels like almost everyone in the financial sector is a scammer sometimes. I know this isn't strictly true, but man the scammers are everywhere.

I was doing research on Sam Bankman Fried in the past week, and even when I searched for terms like ""financial scam"" or ""financial fraud"" or whatever the exact terms I used, I got results back from known scammers like Warrior Trading, who was going to warm me of frauds!

I clicked on a Youtube video from 60 minutes on Sam Bankman Fried, and I said to myself, 60 minutes won't scam me. And then Michael Lewis comes on and starts shilling for SBF. What the heck??

Didn't Michael Lewis write a book about toxic assets, which were then sold to investors as safe and AAA and then leveraged to the hilt, from various Wall St. banks and credit ratings agencies, in a combination of folly/stupidity and greed/fraud? The main question often was what percentage was stupidity and what percentage was scamming the public. That was The Big Short.

Here Lewis takes the side of someone who embezzled billions, freerolled the bezzle with an insane risky bet, recommended lots of shitcoins to unsuspecting investors, encouraged them to use even more risks with derivative bets on these shitcoins, and then outright stole what remained from investors to prop up his failing crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, which has lost billions in bad trades.

CNBC and Bloomberg are always hyping various scams. Elon Musk posts he will make a flying car at Tesla a few years ago, the stock jumps double digits on the news, and CNBC hypes it up. Then invite Michael Saylor to pump his crypto scheme even though he was a scammer way back from the dot com bubble. His firm had major accounting ""issues"" and somehow he is still not only CEO of his stupid company, but invited to pump it while he is dumping shares and has been selling consistently for the past six months or so.

I remember when CNBC was endlessly hyping Nikola and their electric truck and then a few weeks later that was revealed to be a scam and the truck towed up a hill and then a fancy promo is shot making it look like it's running on EV power and CNBC never apologized at all!

Don't get me started on WallStBets and RDDT or DJT. It's scams all the way down!",TSLA,Tesla

Their recent economy-shaking layoffs and subsequent stratospheric profits are hard to even focus on given their other bad behavior.

Meanwhile they are still a staple in ESG funds everywhere, including Vanguard’s ESGV. “Social” in ESG is meaningless.

This is just one company commonly listed in ESG funds. There are many others who have long lists of ongoing societal abuses on their resumes. All the while the expense ratios on these funds are dramatically higher than other index funds.

AI being validated, unbiased, rich information, and search revenue targeting one tiny specific piece to that information pie going to the highest bidder/company with the best SEO strategy (hardly validated, unbiased, or rich).  
I don't necessarily doubt they can release a great AI product, however I question how it will affect their revenue and how they would be able to monetise it without a huge shift in their revenue strategy.

March 1, 2024 (Dow Jones)  
By Derek Horstmeyer  
Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.  
To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.  
The final list of named trends we researched was:  
\-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.  
\-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.  
\-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.  
\-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.  
\-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.  
\-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.  
\-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.  
\-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce  
Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.  
From first mention  
Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.  
For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.  
The first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.  
Worth the ride, until...  
But even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.  
Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.  
When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.  
On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.  
All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.

When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.  
On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.  
All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.

> The Nvidia bandwagon is packed and everyone is jumping on it. It’s fun to be right and more fun to be right in good company. But what if everyone is wrong? Isn’t it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause? 

> Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%.

> over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia’s margins and the company’s ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate. 

> the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house. 

> not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk

> In short, competition is real and it is coming to Nvidia in a meaningful way. More competition pressures Nvidia’s pricing, margins and market share, as well as its rates of revenue and EPS growth. ",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.

Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.  


It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.  


Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.

2024-01-26,14:31:01,investing,Booking Holdings stock analysis (Burry's 4th Largest Holding),"Hi everyone, I hope you are all well. I want to share my thoughts on Booking as a company since I think Booking is interesting. If you're looking for a superficial analysis and don't like reading, look elsewhere. This isn't a superficial analysis, which is what is typically shared. I'll share why I think Booking might be differentiated from major competitors like Expedia and AirBnb. I'll also do an overview of the economics of the business, then write about the industry and competitors and estimate the intrinsic value. As I am sure all of you know, this is just my thoughts so please do your own research. I hope I provide some insights and I welcome an exchange of ideas.

# Company Overview:

Booking is an online travel agency (OTA). It is a parent company that holds a number of brands such as Booking, KAYAK, RentalCars, Priceline, Agoda and Opentable. As a whole, Booking provides reservation services for customers looking for accommodations, flights, rental cars, taxis, and restaurants. There is a lot interplay between these brands.

Booking categories their revenue as Agency, Merchant & Advertising & Other:

Revenue *(In millions)*

||**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**|2014|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Agency|$9,003|$6,663|$4,314|$10,117|$10,480|$9,714|$7,982|$6,527|$5,845|
|Merchant|$7,193|$3,696|$2,117|$3,830|$2,987|$1,891|$1,620|$1,450|$1,329|
|Advertising & Other|$894|$599|$365|$1,119|$1,060|$834|$713|$613|$410|
|**Total**|**$17,090**|**$10,958**|**$6,796**|**$15,066**|**$14,527**|**$12,439**|**$10,314**|**$8,591**|**$7,584**|

Booking mainly generates revenue on commissions. Agency revenue is when Booking makes a reservation for a customer but does not facilitate payment; the supplier (hotels, airlines, etc) will follow up with the customer for payment. Merchant revenue is when Booking acts as a merchant; i.e. collect payment and remits payment to supplier. Bookings earns commission on both of these categories.

Merchant revenue is catching up and increasing its percentage as a proportion of total revenue and although this doesn't negatively impact Booking in regards to its position in the industry, it does negatively impact their margins.

Operating Margins: 

|**2014**|**2015**|**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|**2020**|**2021**|**2022**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|42.2%|40.5%|37.92%|28.18%|36.48%|36.7%|35.48%|\-9.28%|22.78%|

\*We can see that as the merchant category increases as a proportion of sales, operating margins are decreasing. Merchant revenue incurs additional expenses.

***Advertising & Other*** is revenue mainly earned by KAYAK for its meta-search platform: This platform lists hotel chains, flights, etc on its website. ***I am going to disregard this segment because Google Flights does the same thing, so I am estimating no growth here. Some people view Google as a competitor to Booking, and they do compete against KAYAK. However, Google benefits Booking's Agency and Merchant business since Google refers a lot of people to Bookings platforms. Google is ultimately an advertising business, they don't make reservations or facilitate payments.***

Marketing Expense as a % of Total Revenue: 

|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|35%|34.6%|32%|32.9%|34.1%|36.2%|35.4%|35%|

\* Booking spends a lot on marketing and a lot of this spend is performance marketing on Google.

Room nights booked *(in mill):*

|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|896|591|355|845|

\*What I like about this data is that room nights booked (one night booked = one room night) in 2022 is higher than 2019, which was the record prior to COVID. Room nights have been increasing significantly in geographical areas (like Asia-Pacific) which has lower average daily rates compared to areas like Europe and the U.S. This also impacts their margins.

# Competitors:

Bookings Mix of Room nights for hotels and alternative accommodation:

||||||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|
|Hotels, Motels, Resorts|70%|71%|\--|71%|
|Alternative|30%|29%|\--|29%|

**AirBnb:**

The way I am thinking about this is 70% of Bookings accommodations are in hotels and motels and AirBnb mainly generate revenue from homes, holiday houses etc. This is only 30% of Bookings business, which they list as alternative. Although these two companies compete, I don't think it will affect Booking if Airbnb continues to grow since they don't specialise in hotel accommodations. I am curious to know your thoughts about this.

**Website Traffic:**

Expedia: 88.68% website traffic in the U.S.

Airbnb: 71.54% website traffic in the U.S

***Booking: 10.86% website traffic in the U.S***

Most of Bookings website traffic is concentrated in Europe whereas Expedia and Airbnb is concentrated in the U.S. I believe this has other implications, especially when I compare Booking with Expedia that has a business model that is almost identical. Most of the hotel chains in the U.S are very popular: Marriott, Holiday Inn, Hilton, Hampton Inn and Hyatt to name a few. They have their own loyalty programs and big marketing and merchandising (cheap deals) campaigns and customers often seek these hotels out directly, although they are listed on Expedia as well. Since they are popular, they have bargaining power and can request lower commissions to be listed on an OTA. Since Expedia is heavily concentrated in the United States, this has an impact on their margins. Most of Bookings hotel suppliers are outside of the U.S. and these are often smaller, independent chains that rely more heavily on an OTA.

Expedia operating margins:

|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|10.2%|3%|\-29.4%|8%|7%|6.6%|

I have taken the current year FCF estimate (2023 FY results isn't out yet), and have estimated a growth rate of 8% in yrs 1-5 and 6% in yrs 6-10, discount rate of 10% and terminal value of 20. The growth rates are estimated because of the industry growth projections and Bookings position in the market. Also the 5-year previous growth rates for Booking was 8%, which was the lowest compared to my 1-3-7 and 9 years growth rates so I went with that. 8% is a lower growth rate than the industry growth projections and I wanted to be conservative, especially since the FCF in the current year is at record highs. I always like putting a lower growth rate in the latter half (6%) because it is a lot harder to estimate. The discount rate is high, however, my style has always been to make fewer bets for higher returns and I am happy being patient until those opportunities arrive. This gave me an intrinsic value of $4,296. I try and go a bit further to see if I can get a discount to intrinsic value.

2024-01-25,19:36:53,investing,One common mistake of a novice trader,"Let's imagine the mindset of beginners. Beginners want to earn quickly, a lot and with minimal effort. And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.

**How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**  
Let's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.  
**What is wrong with that?**  
The point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.  
**What does good or bad timing mean?**  
In investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.  
For the sake of simplicity let's consider 2 companies: META and AAPL.   
Both of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading, but you should not buy both companies now, if you take them for a short term.  
The fact is that META and AAPL stocks are at their all-time highs right now. They have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected. Since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line. There will always come moments of correction. And if you buy their stocks now, you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times.  
That's why it's important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2024-01-25,19:28:12,investing,Where to read about small cap companies,"Tesla, Microsoft, Apple among many other top companies were once small on the stock market and pretty insignificant in the market. There were few people that were able to jump on early to invest. I understand that many small cap companies will be doomed to fail, but what are some sources/places where I can read about companies like that today? I think back in the day people relied more on conventional media like newspapers and journals, but these days, such information/news is a lot more scattered. What are some more consolidated sources where I can read about smaller companies on the stock market whereby I can determine for myself the growth potential of the company.

EDIT:  
I just want to clarify that my intention with this post is not to find the next small company that is going to boom. My goal here is to try and be able to find a reputable source that is better able to inform me on what smaller publicly traded companies are doing/future plans. I may invest, but I want to be able to be well informed on such companies.

2024-01-24,13:11:11,investing,"Is China set for ""finally"" bottom and an epic rally?","DISCLAIMER: This post can disturb US readers:

  
What a f\* value evaporation we went through in the last years. China, with the bad press from the US major media and subsequently Markets realigning with US policy (decoupling) left the stock market in the lows. You have companies like $BABA that IPOed at $68 per share on Sept. 14, 2014, and last week this thing was touching that price. But let's compare BABA business and valuation quickly:  


|In Millions|2014|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|52,504 RMB or $8,463|868,687 RMB or $126,491|
|Profits|23,403 RMB or  $3,720 |156,906 RMB or $22,583|
|Share Price|\+/- 119$|\+/- 70$|

When China was friendly to the US eyes, the share price of BABA peaked at $300 and I remember that still it was considered a ""value play"" compared to its peers (FAANG or 7MAG)

China has disappointed the market with news (news from US media, reality is always different) and I beleive not a single news can disspoint investors further other than a very extreme US hollywood-driven wet dream of China invading Taiwan (it won't happen militarily, they follow a different policy with a period of 50 to 100 years planning and execution - as they work on long-term leadership, not 4 years elections circus)

Their economy is still doing better than ours in europe or the US, but they aren't active participants of press releases, conference meeting for the front page of Financial Times or election year where US population take it as a sport match.

* BYD took over TESLA. 
* eCommerce in China and South Asia is BABA/Tencent playground moving trillions
* They were the first to release 5G and subsequently US had to take them down with some drama story on Huawei

China state intervened their high growth sectors and companies bcuz their CEOs thought that they could monetise on Chinese publicly-funded resources and create an oligopoly equivalent to the US where Googles, Amazons dominate the citizens privacy, freedom and life. An order has been implemented where they will still exist, but won't cross lines with their algorithms as happened on our side - we are sorrounded by fake news, extreme division, teenagers suicide rate very high, adults depressed and anxiety, etc...

That story is over - I believe China is set to rally and this is the bottom (you read it here first). Recent news signalling this:

>BEIJING, Jan 24 (Reuters) - China's central bank announced a deep cut to bank reserves on Wednesday, in a move that will inject about $140 billion of cash into the banking system and send a strong signal of support for a fragile economy and plunging stock markets.

Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.   
Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.   


Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.

The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.   


**\[Conclusions\]:** Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion.  A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion.

Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.   
No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.

  
Last note,

the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.

I have a record of each initial stock purchase price (people picked everything from stuff that was hot then like NET, SPCE and PLTR to things they thought he'd identify with as he got older like DIS and NKE).

Anyway, the 'purity' of the initial $1K is gone because I've added more money (in small amounts) as people have given additional monetary birthday gifts etc. So now I have an imbalanced mishmash. I've been putting the 'new' money in safe places -- specifically VOO, SPY and BRKB.

Opinions: 

Meta Case: Meta's headset makes you look like a cyborg, its very goofy looking compared to the Apple Vision Pro. It's also angled at gaming, which is problematic because none of the major gaming companies have committed to it, meaning until that occurs there is no guarantee that the gaming angle plays out. I imagine programming a VR game is SIGNIFICANTLY more intensive of an investment than required for an xbox game. That said META is not cannibalizing its own sales nearly as much as Apple...

Apple Case: The vision pro looks much cleaner, as do almost all Apple products. Apple has the wearable tech that will help them make the headset much smaller over time. They are also angled towards business. I just watched the Vision Pro video and frankly it looks like a great product for three reasons: The clean look, the dimming of a room when watching TV/movies which enhances the experience and makes it more convenient. Finally, I think the environment one is very good. I can be doing my work on the vision pro ""literally"" surrounded by Mount Doom's lava and Frodo bringing the ring up to the mountain. The massive con is that the vision pro cannibalizes the iphone and the mac book. As the vision pro gains traction there is immediately less of an incentive for using the iphone and the mac book which make up a big piece of apple's sales.

&#x200B;

What are your thoughts? Right now, my money is in Meta, but after seeing Apple's product I think apple has gone the right direction. Meta is too reliant on the gaming industry and they haven't made it nearly as suitable for wearing it in social situations. No way you're wearing that headset around other people at a party.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

> These captains of the SS S&P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?

> Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero.

The 77 companies featured in bullish articles returned 9.9% on average from the date of publication to the end of the year. Their benchmarks returned 12.7% from the same dates. The two bearish picks featured in the magazine moved in opposite directions, for an average gain of 30.2%.

William Goldman, famous screenwriter and novelist (Princess Bride, All The Presidents Men, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid,etc) wrote a book on his life in Hollywood with the tag of no one knows anything. This was directed at studio execs who couldn’t predict flops or hits or who would be a star and everyone was often wrong on their guesses.

2024-01-18,22:13:00,investing,20 stocks till 2049 - buy and hold for 25 years,"Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community. 

I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.

https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e

The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.

So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold. 

So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049. 

Here is my list so far. 

1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 )
2. Costco
3. Johnson and Johnson
4. Waste Management
5. CVS
6. Home Depot
7. Boeing
8. Caterpillar
9. GE Aerospace
10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia
11. Walmart/Target
12. Starbucks / McDonalds
13. UPS
14. JP Morgan / Bank of America
15. Berkshire / Markel
16. Disney
17. Tesla / GM
18. Hershey
19. Dollar General
20. Lockheed Martin

Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate. 

Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.

Edit: Some really good points in the comments. 

1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment 
2. Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?",TSLA,Tesla
2024-01-17,18:10:49,investing,Apple and Tesla may no longer be ‘safe investments’ as China’s troubles grow,"**From Marketwatch:**

> China represented a 19% chunk of Apple’s revenue in 2023, and roughly 22% for Tesla in the first nine months of last year. 

This makes them “the two most China exposed companies,” of the Magnificent Seven. 

> Apple recently cut handset prices in the China where it battles competitors like Huawei. Tesla also reduced EV prices in the country where Berkshire Hathaway-owned BYD rules. 

“From Peter Navarro, former White House trade adviser under President Donald Trump:”

> “Like GE before it, Apple and Tesla now have this grim mercantilist reality. Because Mr. Cook and Mr. Musk each directed the offshoring of the vast bulk of Apple’s and Tesla’s production to China , the companies are at the mercy of a merciless dictator in Xi Jinping,” he writes.

China is also in the midst of population woes and a stagnating economy. With US sanctions fears adding fuel. 

**From Barrons:**

> We expect the sequential growth momentum of the Chinese economy to stabilize at a subdued level over the course of 2024, with annual growth slowing to 4.4% in 2024 as the reopening effects fade, the property sector remains a drag, and government policies focus on containing downside risks rather than providing a major growth boost,” wrote Julius Baer economist Sophie Altermatt in a research note on Wednesday.

> Shaky consumer confidence and concerns over China’s demographics—the population shrank for the second year in a row in 2023—are bad news for the e-commerce operations that big Chinese technology companies have built their businesses on.

**EDIT:** Crikey guys, I’m just quoting news to hopefully enrich this sub. But the articles “pick on” the two most fan-fave companies and the debate I’m seeing sounds a lot like cheerleading. I have 0 invested in either. Just passing on news cuz I finally knuckled down and got some subscriptions. But plz don’t vent on me, I’m just a messenger. ",TSLA,Tesla

Also what stocks / ETFs are you buying right now to hold long term?,"I’m paying close attention to a small number of industries in 2024 ranging from oil tankers to food supply-chain track & trace, however, lithium is at the very top of my watchlist.  
The lithium supply chain (prospectors, mines, refineries, et al) will be within the blast radius of massive tailwinds as the demand for lithium will continue growing at an expedited rate with a compound annual growth rate of 12% to 20% (depending on what you read).

  
EV’s are the obvious lithium catalyst driven by strict adoption mandates across the EU, US, and Asia. For context on this, a Tesla model S' battery contains around 62.6 kg (138 pounds) of lithium and roughly 2 billion EVs need to be on the road by 2050 for the world to hit net zero emissions - the demand / growth potential of lithium industry is something unprecedented. There’s not much to compare it with and no, it hasn’t been “priced in”.

  
Also, let’s not forget the impact of global relations on lithium and other base metal supply chains. We’re seeing a repatriation of the manufacturing base back to the western world which in this case will favour domestic and near shore lithium projects (Canada and Mexico will likely be the biggest beneficiaries of this).  
I’m currently placing my long term bets in the industry and am bullish on a small number of stocks:  
$ALB - My safety net play  
One of the biggest lithium juggernauts rn with an extensive global portfolio. They hold the title of largest provider of lithium for EV batteries in the world. Albemarle is on a path of industry consolidation via aggressive M&A (This trend is expected to continue in 2024 and beyond).

  
$LIFT.V - My parabolic growth play  
One of the most robust early stage lithium projects I’ve come across in Northern America.

Just by looking at publicly available drill hole data, I believe we could see a total resource of 60+ million tonnes, which would mean and estimate 1-1.4 million tonnes LCE resource.

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

Catalyst: Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

Context: Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

Sector Context:There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

Risks: Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

Related Tickers: FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Catalyst: Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs  in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

Context: Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

Sector Context: Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

Risks: Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

Catalyst: The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

Sector Context: Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

Risks: Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

I don’t get how everyone’s glossing over the fact that Elon literally admitted Hardware 3 won’t cut it for self-driving. For years we heard “flip of a switch” and boom, your Tesla’s a robotaxi. Now it’s, “Oh, you actually need Hardware 4” (or maybe 5 next?).

Meanwhile, there aren’t even that many Hardware 4 cars on the road, and full autonomy definitely isn’t happening in six months. They’re supposedly starting in Austin, probably with a safety driver babysitting the whole thing, and it’ll be a very slow ramp, assuming they can scale at all. 

Musk also admitted training Optimus is a much bigger lift than he let on. If FSD is any indication we are a longggg way off.

The SEC, DOJ, and other oversight agencies have either been neutered or are unwilling to go after him in any meaningful way. The latest earnings reports? Might as well be fiction.

We’ve already seen Tesla repeatedly overpromise and underdeliver—whether it’s FSD, production numbers, or financial projections. But now, with regulators looking the other way and politicians either enabling or actively shielding Musk, there are effectively no consequences for misleading investors.

If there’s no real enforcement, what’s stopping Tesla from manipulating numbers to prop up the stock? And if investors and analysts just keep buying into the hype regardless of fundamentals, what’s the point of even pretending these earnings reports mean anything?

At this point, Tesla’s valuation has become a faith-based system rather than one grounded in financial reality. How long can this charade last?",TSLA,Tesla

DeepSeek V3 was released to the public on December 26, 2024. By early January, the market was already aware that DeepSeek outperforms OpenAI's GPT-4o and Meta's Llama in benchmark tests, having been developed at a cost of only $5.58 million.

In early January, Nvidia dropped as low as $129 due to profit-taking after reaching the height of $153+, partly influenced by the DeepSeek news, but it recovered to $147 just last week. So why the sudden barrage fearmongering articles now triggering a sell-off?

It’s not that the demand for Nvidia chips will drop; it’s about how to produce superior LLMs using the latest Nvidia chip in the AI race. Imagine what the DeepSeek team could achieve with Nvidia's latest chip. We are only at the start of AGI, they still need those high tech chips in the AGI and ASI race. 

Seems like it's a well coodinated efforts by the WS shorters. I can't wait see Gamma Squeeze.

2025-01-24,18:45:49,StockMarket,$500B Stargate AI Project: What Sectors and Stocks Could Win Big?,"So, the $500 billion Stargate AI Project was just announced, and honestly, that’s a huge amount of money being thrown into AI and related tech. It’s got me thinking: what sectors and companies could ride this wave in the near future? If history tells us anything, investments of this scale tend to shake up entire industries, with both big names and under-the-radar players benefiting.

Let’s break it down by sector because there’s a lot to unpack here:

1. Semiconductors: The Brains Behind AI

AI doesn’t run without hardware, and semiconductors are at the heart of it all. GPUs, CPUs, and those fancy AI-specialized chips are the foundation of machine learning. Companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel are already dominating this space, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they see even more demand. Nvidia, especially, is practically the poster child for AI hardware. Their growth has been insane, and a project of this magnitude could push it even further. Expect AI chips to continue driving their revenue in the coming years.

2. Cloud Computing & Data Centers

AI projects need a ton of computing power and storage. That’s where the big cloud providers—AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud—come in. These companies are likely already gearing up to grab their slice of the Stargate pie. Then you’ve got data center companies like Equinix and Digital Realty Trust, which could also benefit. All this AI data has to live somewhere, and these companies provide the backbone for hosting it.

3. AI Software Players

It’s not just about the hardware—companies building the actual AI tools and software are in a great spot, too. Think Palantir, C3.ai, and Snowflake. These players already help businesses make sense of their data and implement AI-driven solutions, so they could see a major surge in demand. The rise of AI as a service (AIaaS) could also give these companies a big boost as the Stargate Project moves forward.

4. Startups: The Dark Horses

This is where things get really interesting. While the big names are obvious winners, startups working on niche AI applications (think robotics, edge computing, and automation) could also see some major growth. Some of these smaller companies aren’t on anyone’s radar right now, but they could pop up as key players—or even get acquired by the bigger guys. If you’re into high-risk, high-reward opportunities, this might be where you want to look.

5. Telecom & Networking: Supporting the AI Boom

AI depends on fast, low-latency networks to transfer data efficiently. That’s why telecom and networking companies are probably smiling right now. Companies like Cisco, Juniper Networks, and even those working on 5G infrastructure could benefit. After all, all that AI data has to move through fast, reliable connections, and these are the folks making that possible.

6. Autonomous Tech & EVs

This one’s a bit of a wildcard, but it makes sense. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Mobileye that are working on self-driving cars and autonomous tech could see a boost. AI is critical for advancing self-driving capabilities, and a major investment like this might accelerate developments in the space.

7. Cybersecurity

As AI adoption grows, so do concerns around data privacy and security. Cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Zscaler could also be beneficiaries. Protecting sensitive AI systems and the data they process is going to be a top priority.

So, what do you all think? Are there other sectors or companies that might benefit? Any smaller names worth keeping an eye on? Let’s discuss!

2025-01-24,13:51:25,StockMarket,"Finally, a refreshing change! (Kering, BMW, Richemont, Mercedes, Porsche, )","For once, it feels so satisfying not to see the same stocks—PLTR, MSTR, TSLA, NVDA—soaring endlessly to new highs.

* **Kering**: +10% this week
* **Volkswagen (VW)**: +11% this month
* **Mercedes**: +8% this month
* **Porsche**: +7% this month

My question is what are people's general thoughts/opinions on Tesla? 

No one can read the future I know, but do you think the price could keep rising and is worth holding or is it getting a bit too risky to hold with Elon getting more involved in politics and Trump pushing the oil motive.

Also what politicians or family members of politicians that are not in office or currently in office that are either are on the boards of certain companies
That would benefit from Americas control of the Panamal Canal and ownership of Greenland? 

I also want to know about what the current & future cabinet members either own or are buying in stocks that would benefit from the Panamal Canal & Greenland. 

Please don't hate the player , hate the game. 

If you are taking sides politically in this conversation please step aside.  I don't care what political party they belong to.  Im about sharing information to everyone so we all can make money. 

Thanks please let's not make this conversation worth my while.  If you don't like a certain politician or certain political party that's ok. 

Don't make this about hate or loving a politician.

you know who also thought a certain market would always go up and were SO beyond confident in it.

the banks who caused the housing crisis. 

The market is inflated. if you don’t think so…ask yourself why so many people have started investing who don’t know what they are doing. how many people who have full faith reoccurring investments in SPY who don’t even care to look at macro issues we have. 

people are blinded by bullish sentiment. 

Most of the MAG7 stocks which make up a significant amount of SPY basically just run off hype. 

TESLA is so incredibly overbought yet every day there’s people posting “TESLA TO 500!” 

Tesla doesn’t even have to release any news. elon could say 2 words on twitter and the stock goes up 30 dollars on the day. 

you don’t think we are in a bubble???

the funny part is, the crisis we enter from this hyper inflated market can’t be stopped. the government is so deep into debt. the most in US history, they can’t bail themselves out. the government almost had a shutdown due to budgeting a few months ago…and you think they can bail us out in a recession???

the government barely has enough money to sustain itself. actually no. it doesn’t have ANY money to sustain itself. 

i’m not sure when, no one does, but when this crash happens, the government will not be there to stop it. they don’t have the money. which means neither do the banks. the current debt we are in has almost caused a shutdown. 

if we enter a recession, the government can’t give out money to banks/stimulus checks/reduce taxes. we are AT the threshold of what the government can sustain. if we enter a recession, the government literally cannot afford it. mix that in with the hyper inflated market…i don’t see how anyone is bullish on the market anymore. 

something horrible is brewing. dumb investors who believe tech will always go up, a government that literally cannot sustain itself financially, and tech making up an overwhelming chunk of the market in which a lot of blind bullish investors are heavily invested in. ",TSLA,Tesla

He cleaned up the culture mess, shoved aside long-term moonshots (like Uber’s self-driving unit) and put the company on a strict path to profitability (as expected from a former Wall Street banker).

Despite getting smacked by COVID and high interest rates, Uber tightened its belt, doubled down on demand-supply matchmaking, and came out profitable. Wall Street went nuts. Uber is now FCF-positive and aiming for even higher margins.

**So what is Uber today?**

Dara says they’re laser-focused on nailing that perfect supply-demand match. Sure, they’re winning in mobility and they might tackle new verticals like Fiverr-style marketplaces. Sounds great, except they’re missing out on the biggest opportunity of our era, which motherfucking **AI**

Uber collects **11B trips** a year from **160M users**, racking up insane amounts of data (driver reviews, food reviews, social patterns across countless cities etc). This could’ve made them a self-driving powerhouse. But they ditched their autonomous unit in 2020 to cut costs, just as NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang now shows off new automotive processors and partnerships with Toyota, Aurora (who bought Uber’s AV unit), and Volvo. **Uber’s name is nowhere on that list!!!**

https://preview.redd.it/sp025g0iysbe1.png?width=1622&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f335b05d6b23471acba1d8aba29f9af6fe462f3

No matter how you spin it, a simple “supply-demand” marketplace could get overshadowed once autonomous vehicles go mainstream. Especially when you already own the infrastructure for ride-hailing, food delivery, scooters and bikes.

**Activist investors might be licking their chops (at least I would do it If I were them)** at two big plays:

1. **Pull a Reddit:** Sell anonymized data for LLM training and get lots of money, further increasing margins. Instantly, Uber gets an “AI play.”
2. **Sell to Tesla or Google:** Supercharge someone else’s AV ambitions (as well as their foundation models) and get a fat premium in the process.

Meanwhile, the stock still looks undervalued. Uber’s **LTM P/FCF** is around **22.6x**, PEG is **under 1.0x** (Peter Lynch territory), and a Reverse DCF suggests they only need **9.2% revenue growth** (at \~12.4% margins) over 10 years to justify the current price. That’s totally doable.

Here’s how I see it playing out:

1. **Best case:** Tesla or Google acquires them this year and we get a solid premium payday. Probably a stock deal, but it’s still peanuts compared to Tesla and Google market caps
2. **Second best:** Uber pivots to selling AI training data
3. **Not bad either:** Uber dominates more human-driven marketplaces
4. **Base scenario:** They stick to mobility, keep expanding margins, and *maybe* bolt on third-party AVs

2025-01-06,10:38:51,StockMarket,Mag7 - Personal experiment 2024,"**Hi everyone!**

In 2024, I decided to try a simple but consistent investment experiment: I invested **€10 per week** in the ""Magnificent 7"" (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA, TSLA, and META). The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice, but I can’t remember when exactly (oops!).

**Results**:

* The current portfolio value is **€706.80**, which means a profit of **€186.80** (+35.92% return).

**Key Takeaways**:

* **Consistency works:** Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!
* **Stock selection matters:** The ""Magnificent 7"" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.
* **Patience is key:** I didn’t touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.

This was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy.

It’s just my experience—not right, not wrong—just mine, and I wanted to share it with you!

2025-01-06,10:38:51,StockMarket,Mag7 - Personal experiment 2024,"**Hi everyone!**

In 2024, I decided to try a simple but consistent investment experiment: I invested **€10 per week** in the ""Magnificent 7"" (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA, TSLA, and META). The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice, but I can’t remember when exactly (oops!).

This wasn’t my only investment, and its sole purpose was to see how it would perform over the course of a year. It’s not an allocation I plan to keep in the future.

**Results**:

* I invested a total of **€520** throughout the year.
* The current portfolio value is **€706.80**, which means a profit of **€186.80** (+35.92% return).

2025-01-05,15:31:31,StockMarket,Robinhood Business Model: The First Taste is Always Free,"https://preview.redd.it/4sl6jsfsq6be1.jpg?width=1467&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc0aea1dec359f395f717d32b0ef028ee544edf4

There’s nothing I hate more than rich people trying to profit from those who are less fortunate, and there’s not a worse offender on the planet than the dipshits running Robinhood. Those bastards, under the cloak of the steal-from-the-rich/give-to-the-poor folklore, are doing the exact opposite with the most covert and sleezy psychological tricks known to man.

Sure, Robinhood says it’s trying to level the playing field. Empower the Everyday Joe. Give the single mom with five kids a chance to overcome her title of Coupon Queen. Well, horseshit! What Robinhood is doing is encouraging addiction as they try to siphon hard-earned dollar from the poor and middle class.

But how?

Well, first, you’ve got to realize how Robinhood makes all their money.

https://preview.redd.it/cwgelutyq6be1.jpg?width=676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d49fdeb6508c11ce65d0b0baa2f3aaa76ebba231

[FROM ROBINHOOD WEBSITE](https://preview.redd.it/it8ey75uq6be1.jpg?width=727&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8894902b0ad4a16102083f00799fd43311cf6e2f)

 

Yeah, that little rounding up to the nearest penny may not sound like much, but if you multiply that by billions of transactions every day, it’s an invisible goldmine, which is why Robinhood wants you to trade, and Trade, AND TRADE.

So how can Robinhood encourage more trading?

Confetti.

https://preview.redd.it/cdg9xsh0r6be1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2777b7aa4f846335494ce6999b5367993b5c9c0

Looks harmless. Until you ask yourself, “Why IN. THE. FUCK. Would a trading app shoot confetti every time a person executes a trade?”

Dopamine of course! They want users to feel GOOD when they trade. And if you are so naïve to underestimate the true power of this little PR gimmick, then why do you think Meta has a like button and Reddit gives medals to encourage engagement?

https://preview.redd.it/lo5lzug2r6be1.jpg?width=872&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eac94efb97ccf82f2b8065b0b9878824f382da2a

But Robinhood can’t just stop at confetti. They got to make the user believe that Robinhood’s user-friendly FREE platform and day-trading app can turn a basement gamer/gambler into a Wall Street pro.

And guess what?  It’s working!

Because with all of Robinhood’s emphasis on candlesticks, technicals, and speculative options, they’re encouraging all of their 25 million users to step inside the casino and directly compete against Wall Street’s elite. Who, by the way, are using Bloomberg Terminals, which aren’t FREE!

Instead, Wall Street values these terminals so much, that they’re willing to pay $25k in annual subscriptions for the information these little dudes provide, which begs the question, “If Robinhood’s tools really level the playing field, why aren’t all the hedge-fund managers signing up for party horns and confetti? Or better yet, why are they still paying annual subscriptions for Bloomberg Terminals?

And if all these little fun facts about the Robinhood Business Model aren’t enough to convince a user of the crooked intentions of its founders, hell, now, CEO Flad Tenev, isn’t even trying to hide it. He’s out front, advocating sports gambling as a future Robinhood “tool” to help users build wealth inside their retirement or day-trading accounts.

[CNBC CLIP](https://preview.redd.it/9i6rt955r6be1.jpg?width=875&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9230c108de6e487cc9383e3a393e14d351fd79c0)

Makes me sick.

But there’s not a damn thing I can do about it, because despite the confetti, day-trading tools, and sports betting that ALL encourage addiction, Robinhood has absolutely no shame. But instead of raising a cocked pistol to every user’s temple, Robinhood has a better ideal.

“Let’s give anyone a margin account!”

So if you’re reading this and do happen to feel like a victim of Robinhood’s bullshit Business Model, just stop, and know that there’s a better/easier way to build generational wealth than gambling. Pick your spots, forget the technicals, and stop confusing movement with progress. There’s only one way the Little Guy can build true wealth and compete against Wall Street, and it has nothing to do with day trading.

If you think I’m bluffing. Go ahead. Count them.

2024-12-27,05:39:31,StockMarket,"What I learned from Jefferies's latest investment report, about AI software stock opportunities in 2025...","Recently, the popularity of AI software has been steadily increasing. As AI narratives have entered their second phase—application-level development—companies like AppLovin and Palantir, which have seen their revenues multiply in just one year, are becoming more prominent. Moreover, in the past couple of months, the performance of the software sector has clearly outpaced that of the semiconductor sector.

Today, I'd like to share with you a recent report from the investment bank Jefferies titled ***AI Software: The Hot Debate of 2025***. In this report, we explore whether AI software will experience explosive growth in the U.S. stock market by 2025 and which companies stand the best chance of benefiting.

https://preview.redd.it/8kzmiakhlb9e1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=6901a0e59fc81dfa885ee904e0eb77fa36fd6237

This report is 240 pages long. In addition to covering five major market debates (see page 2), it also includes detailed assessments of over ten companies in the AI software space, with around ten pages dedicated to each company. This makes it an excellent resource for anyone looking to understand the AI software landscape.

https://preview.redd.it/h1gnelgilb9e1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=73f7d3e1a1000d13d9cfa57bedbf0127cdc4f6c3

**Key takeaway:** Although revenue growth will remain modest through 2025 and 2026, it is recommended to begin positioning for promising companies now. Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta are among the key players mentioned.

Here are some interesting insights from the report:

**1. Will AI Software Explode in 2025?**

⚡️ Software revenue will gradually increase, but it won't experience the same explosive growth as semiconductors. If semiconductor growth is likened to a rocket, software is more like an airplane (see page 4 of the report).

https://preview.redd.it/3zk7aqojlb9e1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f286bac2b015049bf39940b8ee0e97bc4f3b26d

⚡️ The turning point for AI's impact on software revenue is expected to occur in the second half of 2025 (see page 5).

⚡️ The growth sequence will follow the natural order of business: first, infrastructure like cloud computing, then application software (see page 6).

⚡️ Full deployment will take 1-3 years, with a more significant share of the market occurring after 2026 (see page 7).

**2. What is the Return on AI Investments?**

This has been a recurring topic this year, and the positive arguments are becoming more abundant:

⚡️ Sales from backlogged orders have exceeded capital expenditures by 111%.

⚡️ Successful AI applications continue to emerge, particularly in areas like code development, media tools, and scientific research.

⚡️ Adoption of AI in front-office functions like IT and sales is accelerating, with AI expected to represent 80% of enterprise applications.

**3. Why is Microsoft a Good Bet Despite Its Underperformance This Year?**

Among the major tech companies, Microsoft's performance this year has been rather average. Since the launch of ChatGPT, its stock has underperformed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (IGV) by 19%.

⚡️ However, Microsoft is poised to benefit from two major waves of software development (see page 10): Azure AI in infrastructure and M365 Copilot in applications.

⚡️ The company stands to gain from OpenAI's growth (see page 11), receiving 20% of OpenAI's revenue. As OpenAI's exclusive cloud service provider, Microsoft will also earn a significant portion of OpenAI's expenditures, including future model training costs.

⚡️ AI-related revenue is expected to grow from 3% of total revenue to 10% by 2026 (see pages 12-13). Azure AI is projected to contribute $15 billion in 2026, while M365 Copilot will contribute another $13 billion.

**And this is what I concluded:**

In 2025, the broader growth in AI software will likely be driven by its applications across various industries. For instance, AppLovin ($APP) has surged by 750% this year, thanks to its innovative use of AI in advertising. Similarly, Carvana ($CVNA) has risen by around 320%, fueled by AI applications in the used-car market.

There are also many AI-related stocks in industries yet to be fully discovered. For example, AIX Inc. ($AIFU) is a small-cap company applying AI software in the insurance sector. Its AI models focus on areas like intelligent customer service, sales enablement, and could eventually expand into personalized product pricing, underwriting, claims processing, and risk management. While its stock has not seen significant growth yet, it could potentially benefit from a market surge in AI software by 2025, revealing a bright future.

In summary, the AI software sector's explosive growth is not just about tech companies—it’s about how AI can transform a wide range of industries. Investors who position themselves early may see significant returns as the sector matures.

**Strategy:**

For the $147 divide it into 4 payments or however many stocks I have. The one that is the cheapest and the most declining i put the biggest payment into it. 

contributing $210 into stock market each month.   
\* Ex 55 (Most Declining price) + 45 + 30 + 15 (most Increasing price) = 145.   
\* 55+ 45 +30+15

**Large cap stocks (70%) -Initial $1330 :  Contribute extra $147 Each Month** 

* Apple - 259 x 1
* MRVL - 115 x 2 230
* Amazon - 225x 1
* Meta 600 x 1

**Small Cap Stocks (30%) - Initial $570 : Contribute extra $63 Each Month**

* SP Funds S&P 500 Sharia Industry Exclusions ETF - 43 x 13.2 = 570 
   * I know This isn't as good as Voo/VTI, but I prefer a sharia/halal ETF, this actually does good too.

QUESTION: For my large cap stocks, I'm thinking of buying 2 shares of everything, or just keeping it the way it is. Only saying this because I feel like the market will be crashing soon. I'll buy more at a lower price if I keep it the way I have it right now. I'm also putting $210 in monthly total, so I think I'm good, or will prices rise more and I'll miss out on this discount?

I considered adding in Micron (MU), but it hasn't been doing well last 6 months, I might consider buying a share later once it stops going horizontal. Unless you disagree and think it has a higher value than another stock on my list (replacing one share from my list).",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

This shift begs the question: who will be next to benefit from the substantial capital inflow into the automotive sector? 

Will historical European automakers like Stellantis, BMW, Porsche, and VW capitalize on the momentum?

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

I'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).

2024-12-20,15:45:21,StockMarket,Can Tesla bounce back quickly,"Tesla stock has been on a recent surge, especially after Trump's victory, with shares soaring from $246.23 to $487, a gain of nearly 97%. This rise has been largely driven by politics, particularly Musk's relationship with Trump. But the question is, how long will this premium due to politics last?



Tesla's future is also closely tied to Fully Self-Driving (FSD). If FSD is successfully rolled out and receives regulatory approval, Tesla could transform into an online car company, which would be a steady source of cash flow. However, regulatory issues and technology rollout remain challenges.



Although Tesla's stock price has risen sharply, analysts have mixed views on its outlook. Barclays maintains a “Neutral” rating, believing that Tesla's stock price is out of touch with the company's fundamentals, with a price target of $270. CFRA, on the other hand, is more optimistic about Tesla, raising its price target to $560, believing that the elimination of the electric vehicle tax credit will help Tesla expand its market share.



Going forward, Tesla could be at risk of a stock price correction, but if FSD goes smoothly and there are no regulatory hurdles, Tesla's long-term outlook remains bullish.

2024-12-18,08:50:26,StockMarket,NVIDIA's Recent Decline and Opportunities for a New Rally,"NVIDIA fell nearly 4% today before narrowing the loss to 1.22%. Since hitting a record closing high of $148.88 in early November, the AI chip maker's stock has dropped over 10%.

So, what is causing NVIDIA's decline?

**1. Supply Chain Issues and Challenges**

NVIDIA faces multiple challenges in its supply chain, a significant factor in its stock decline.

First, according to the latest data, the order volume and schedules for the GB200 and GB300 have been adjusted. Particularly, the mass production and shipment of GB series products have been postponed until after the Lunar New Year in February, increasing market uncertainty. Additionally, the small-scale production plans for GB300 face tight deadlines, putting pressure on GB200's mass production.

https://preview.redd.it/scpz7bjoak7e1.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c84a2bd55783d7b6efd0bfff35d9d3c4a3db74bb

Specific supply chain issues include CoWoS-L packaging technology, heating problems, copper cable connections, and leakage issues. These not only affect product yield rates but also increase system integration time costs. Consequently, NVIDIA has suggested customers purchase the B200 8-card HGX as a transitional solution, and clients like Microsoft are considering switching their orders. These supply chain issues affect NVIDIA's product delivery capabilities and reduce market expectations for its future performance.

**2. Market Competition and Narrative Changes**

ASICs are gaining market recognition as a competitive narrative.

ASICs are chips designed for specific tasks, akin to custom running shoes for a race. For certain tasks, ASICs outperform NVIDIA's GPUs (widely used for computing tasks) and are potentially cheaper.

OpenAI co-founder Ilya and industry leaders like Microsoft's CEO Satya have started discussing the importance of not only training AI models but also ensuring they can quickly and accurately make decisions in real applications. This shift in perspective gives ASICs an advantage in some scenarios, as they are designed for rapid, precise execution of tasks.

This raises questions about the cost of NVIDIA's GPUs. While powerful, they are expensive and require significant electricity and cooling. As ASICs perform better at lower costs for some tasks, there's consideration of replacing NVIDIA's GPUs with ASICs.

Additionally, changes in scaling law narratives and the strengthening of inference narratives pose threats to NVIDIA.

Scaling laws suggest that increasing AI model size (e.g., more neurons or layers) typically improves performance, but these gains are not infinite and require significant computational resources. This means NVIDIA must continually invest resources to improve product performance, potentially increasing costs.

Moreover, companies like BTC, Tesla, and Google are investing heavily in their own AI chips or solutions. This intensifies market competition and challenges NVIDIA's leadership.

**3. Market Sentiment and Capital Flows**

Market sentiment and capital flow significantly impact NVIDIA's stock price. As the year ends, retail investors, ETFs, and institutions adjust their portfolios. Fluctuations in tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Google affect tech stocks like NVIDIA. Investors are more cautious, favoring stable, promising companies.

Given these conditions, NVIDIA faces pressure on its stock price due to supply chain issues and competition. Lowered expectations for NVIDIA's future performance lead to capital outflows and stock price declines.

  
**4. Future Outlook and Catalysts**

Despite current challenges, NVIDIA has opportunities for a turnaround.

First, NVIDIA needs to resolve supply chain issues, improve product yield, and delivery capabilities. Second, strengthening its presence in software and applications is crucial to addressing market competition. Additionally, NVIDIA should explore new computing narratives to expand its computing potential.

 **5. Technical Analysis and Price Divergence**

Previously, prices rose continuously, but volume and KDJ began to decline, showing divergence. Without capital support, upward momentum was insufficient, leading to a short-term adjustment and a break below the mid-term trend line, resulting in a mid-term adjustment.

When Might a New Rally Occur?

From a technical analysis perspective: After two prior mid-term adjustments, breaking the downward trend line may signal the start of a new rally. Thus, this new rally must first break the resistance line.

From a catalyst perspective: While January's CES and the earnings release in late February may not bring major surprises, March's GTC is worth anticipating. NVIDIA needs to showcase new technologies and products at this event to restore market confidence. If NVIDIA can introduce groundbreaking innovations, a stock rebound is possible. ",TSLA,Tesla
2024-12-17,17:30:05,StockMarket,Hindenburg Omen ,"Hey all!

Did we get a 2nd Hindenburg Omen in a month?

The 10Y-3M yield curve un-inverted last week. Which typically un-inverts very close to the MARKET TOP (not recession, but market top).

Things are so frothy with Tesla, BTC, Broadcom, but the rest of the market seems to be stumbling.

I feel like we are very much at the top. Everyone is just desperately trying to pickup pennies in front of a freight train.....

What are your thoughts on this? January seems like it's posied for serious pain.

Do you think the covid hangover allows things to keep going up longer than usual? Or are you in the ""this time is different crowd""?

Or are you like me and thinking a serious rebalancing is in order?

Does anyone know how many times the 2nd trigger of the Hindenburg Omen has been wrong? I'm not an expert, just a retail guy who loves data.

TLDR: Hindenburg Omen triggered twice in the last month which means we are at a major top",TSLA,Tesla

2024-12-12,03:09:50,StockMarket,Trying to justify puts ,"Ok, call me crazy but TSLA valuation isn’t making sense. My rationale is kind of easy, I see more Rivian SUVs and truck around me than Cybertruck and it’s been a long long time since anybody I know bought a Tesla car/SUV. 


Robotaxi - China is way ahead of the States when it comes to Robotaxi and I feel Waymo already has the first movers advantage 

Model Q - it’s at least 3-4 years away, Tesla doesn’t have the turn around time that Chinese companies have 


Chinese EVs - while they won’t be allowed in USA but they have made their point, they are cheaper, equally good and in some cases better - Tesla has limited international growth potential now. Like I hear in India people are paying over 100% in tariffs to buy BYD from Singapore - they say it’s still good value for money

Elon will have to make some tall promises (again) in the next earnings call to justify this valuation - because he’s not selling as many cars and Robotaxi or model Q are still a distant future. ",TSLA,Tesla

2024-12-09,16:46:43,StockMarket,QUBT is about to crash hard,"Context: Quantum computing is having its moment. It’s risky, but could massively disrupt industries in areas like computing, finance and cyber security. But stock market bubbles are forming. 

Quantum computing is probably the most technically difficult industry for analysts to assess. Few people are equipped with an adequate understanding of quantum technologies, which is leading to massive mispricing. 

QUBT is junk

Quantum Computing Inc. has many problems. Iceberg Research’s recent short report covers some of them. They note that the firm has run from one fad to another (chips, ai, computing) and failed at each. They list several misleading claims that QUBT has made and withdrawn. The report is damning and raises serious questions about the future of the company, I encourage you all to read it. 

However Iceberg does not go far enough.

https://iceberg-research.com/2024/11/27/quantum-computing-inc-the-phantom-chip-foundry/

QUBT lacks talent. Successful quantum innovations requires strong technical knowledge that you really can only come by in either leading universities or megacap firms like google. 

I went through the Linkedin profiles of each of QUBT’s employees and compared them with their small cap competitors. I tallied up the share of employees that went to an Edu Rank top-100 world universities for Quantum Physics (which is a very broad net), QUBT ranks incredibly poorly among it’s peers - less than a fifth of employees (see picture)*. This is robust to different ranking metrics. Counting only Ivy leagues QUBT comes out much worse.

But look, not all employees are on linkedin. Maybe QUBT is the next big underdog? No. 

A large share of QUBT’s “talent” comes from the Steven’s Institute of Technology, an unremarkable university in New Jersey (ranked 150+ for Quantum Physics depending on list) 

The company’s Chief Quantum Officer is Yuping Huang. On first glance he appears to have a prolific publishing history; however, most papers receive low citations and/or he is third, fourth or fifth author. Huang was previously sued by shareholders for breaching fiduciary duties when he merged his previous company QPhoton with QUBT. Notably he is both a QUBT director and employee, which is a big corporate governance redflag (reminds me of $SAVA). 

There is only one independent director with a background in Quantum Physics to provide checks and balance on Huang — Dr Javad Shabani. He is not up to the task. His publishing history is mediocre. 

Looking deeper, the Chief Technology Officer Yong Meng Sua, has an even more mediocre publishing history. And has only risen to an Assistant Professor role at Steven’s. He spends much of his time discussing esoteric computing questions tangential to his work (i.e. the NP=P problem, see their LinkedIn posts)

And finally the Director of the Company’s chip foundry (Iceberg has raised significant questions about the foundry). Dr Milan Begliarbekov after finishing high school enrolled in a bachelor’s degree in English literature at Steven’s, graduated, then immediately enrolled in a physics Phd at Steven’s. Either he is a savant polymath who is able to pick up grad school physics level math, or a Phd from Steven’s is worthless. His publishing career is very mediocre. 

These scientists will not crack the major problems stopping widespread commercialization of Quantum tech. Simply compare their publishing records to the founder at Ion-Q (Peter Chapman) or leading quantum scientists at Google, alongside the significant and verifiable technological advancements these companies have made. 

Another clue that something is amiss is headcount. Rigetti has three fold the number of employees as QUBT. QBTS has six fold. All have similar market cap. What’s driving value? We’ve established that it’s not human capital. Iceberg’s research reveals it’s not intellectual property or physical capital either. 

So why has it done so well? QUBT’s high valuation is driven by regarded retail investors.

Only 3.3% of QUBT is held by institutional investors (and falling). Compared with ~40% for IONQ, ~30% for RGTI and ~47% for QBTS. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qubt/institutional-holdings

The lack of institutional investment in QUBT while institutional investors are simultaneously clamouring to load up on quantum stocks is a massive red flag that something is up with QUBT. In fact no Wall Street analysts track QUBT. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/quantum-computing-qubt-stock-skyrockets-short-sellers-are-lurking

So what happens next? 

QUBT’s 800% rise in one month is going to attract short selling interest as people realise it’s junk. The stock will fall back below $1. 

Risk:
If you want to short/buy puts, You can rest assured that the company is not going to suddenly become profitable. The main risk comes from why QUBT has done so well, despite having little revenue, expertise, or innovation to show for it.

QUBT is literally called Quantum Computing Incorporated. If you’re a full regard wanting to invest in Quantum computing are you going to invest in IonQ (what?), Rigetti (spaghetti company?) or a company conveniently called Quantum Computing? It’s a regard trap.

1000 put contracts to sell @$4.50, cost average = 0.11, expiring Dec 20. If this doesn’t work I’m going to buy puts again and again. This company sucks.

2024-12-05,18:52:40,StockMarket,Seeking Feedback on My 200k Investment Strategy at 24,"Hi fellow investors,

I recently inherited **$200k** and have been investing for the past five years with great success—my portfolio is up 130% over the last 2 years. However, I've typically been working with smaller amounts, i've invested for a total of $10k, so managing this larger sum feels a bit more overwhelming. 

With the market currently at a high, I'm uncertain whether I should invest all at once, use a lump sum, or go for a DCA approach.

Here’s my portfolio plan for the next 5 years:

* **40% S&P 500** (It needs to comply with UCITS regulations since I’m not a U.S. citizen yet..)
* **20% META** (I have a strong belief in META's potential)
* **15% GOOG** (I think it’s undervalued, and once the current lawsuit is behind them, it will grow)
* **10% TSM**
* **10% MSFT**
* **2.5% LULU**
* **2.5% ORCL**

I’d love to get your thoughts on my portfolio. I know it’s quite tech-heavy, but throughout my investing journey, I’ve had good results with companies I understand and believe in, and would like to stick with that strategy. I’m young and comfortable with taking on some risks, as I believe time is on my side.

Looking forward to your constructive feedback!

Although Nvidia saw a dip due to high market expectations, the long-term outlook for AI remains strong, with chip sales still showing impressive growth. While there’s competition from AMD, the overall demand for AI chips is skyrocketing.  



The Mag 7 remains the key growth driver for AI. Analysts predict these companies will keep growing, with capital spending expected to surge by double digits, reaching nearly $300 billion by 2027 (according to FactSet). Nvidia benefits from chip demand, while Meta drives revenue through advertising.



And even though the Mag 7 has outperformed the market (twice the S&P 500's gains), their valuations are still reasonable—around 27 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, down from over 30 times earlier this year, and near the middle of their historical range (according to Evercore).

2024-11-16,02:51:11,StockMarket,Some positive re-encouragement needed feels like I've got (fomo) ,"With stocks ripping to new highs. BTC on the brink of 100K I just feel like threw an opportunity to be financially free. 

I've trying to plan moves but don't know if it's even worth it at this point. It everything keeps on ripping I'm just gunna feel devastated losing positions I shouldn't have traded out of. 

But then if I reinvest. I'm probably subjecting myself to a possible downside of a crash and considering how high major stocks are such as $Tesla $Btc, $Mstr, $Hood  just to name a few. I just don't know what the play is anymore. I'm at a total loss mindset. 

Btc is too far gone for me to make any real worthwhile profit. I dont have the surplus amount in capital or savings to enjoy making a trade. The ""what goes up must come down looms"" 

I had a plan but now I'm just dragging along. In the hopes of some black Swan event. 

The whole world is apparently going through an economic crisis from America to Europe and everything in between. 

What's peoples thoughts currently on the markets in general. ",TSLA,Tesla
2024-11-15,13:54:11,StockMarket,It's 287 a reasonable stop-loss for TSLA?,"I bought 3 stocks of TSLA at 330 knowing that I was willing to lose up to 130-ish dollars, and wanted to make 130-ish dollars. The reason being: I'm moving to Japan on December 29th and was considering travelling somewhere for two days for New Year's and maybe being frugal with my cash and choice of hotel or something. My logic being: if I don't make bank on this bet, I'll just celebrate in Tokyo and save 140 dollars on stupid expenses, no big deal. 

The recent announcement to cut EV incentives scared me and I set a stop-loss at 287. However, I've got a bit of FOMO knowing it could bounce back after that. But my intuition says it's more likely to crash if it reaches that point.

I could also just sell now and take the losses, fuck it. Thoughts?",TSLA,Tesla

Is it worth getting RKLB and selling VOO? I believe RKLB has loads of potential and that the stock will shoot up as soon as they get a successful Neutron launch out of the way. Also, despite what some are fearing, I doubt Elon would interfere in RKLB's business. Neutron is not a F9 competitor for now and until they can get their cadence up, it won't even be. A Trump presidency does not seem like that much of a risk. Especially with Elon fighting for things like deregulation, which will help everyone including RKLB. I do understand going all in on a single company stock like RKLB is very risky, but if things do pan out, this will be like buying Tesla in the early 2010s. Space is the new market and RKLB is right behind SpaceX in it. I'm 15 so I have a long investment horizon.",TSLA,Tesla

2024-11-11,06:11:25,StockMarket,I'm extremely bullish on TSLA. ,"I just had hand surgery so I'm writing this one-handed, but during my recovery I did nothing but look at TSLA charts. I've never been a big believer of technical analysis and I know some people ride and die for support levels but honestly I find it can be quite distracting and not very useful. In this case, however, we can notice a pattern of bag holders who have FOMO'd into something they've wanted to sell for a quick buck and then had to bear the pain sometimes for years. A good deal of those sold at a loss at some point but TSLA's Market Cap is still made up in some part of people in the red. These people have been waiting to cash in for years and at this point they're not gonna sell unless it at least hits a historic high. So I do believe that a price of $400 is, at least for now, an important support level for this stock, and if I know the dude-bro culture that is largely responsible of this rally, I'd actually say $420 is an ever more reasonable price within the next 2 months.

2024-11-06,23:56:55,StockMarket,RIVN and other EV makers: How will Trump-Musk dynamics affect the market?,"We all know Musk and Trump have a ""special relationship,"" and with Trump returning to office, I can't help but wonder how this might affect other EV manufacturers, especially Rivian.

On the positive side, Volkswagen's investment in RIVN seems solid, and it looks like exactly the kind of European business involvement Trump wants to see in the US market. But here's what's bugging me - could Musk's influence on Trump's policies create an uneven playing field for emerging EV brands?

Some points to consider:
- Rivian's growing production numbers and improving margins
- VW's commitment to the US market through RIVN
- Tesla's dominant position and Musk's political connections
- Potential policy changes affecting EV subsidies

2024-11-06,17:30:29,StockMarket,+$1000 in My Portfolio Thanks to TSLA's 12% Jump – Other Sectors Hit Hard,"Got some nice news today when I checked my investment tracker—up $1,000!

https://preview.redd.it/5dpyagc04bzd1.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&s=b473a5745af3011af92b03076012308fd8af67fb

\#TSLA is definitely carrying the returns even though it's only 5% of my portfolio.

Being the single largest donor to Trump's campaign is working out for Elon (and me).

What surprised me, though, is seeing other stocks like Coca-Cola (KO) and some REITs reacting negatively, dropping by about -4%. It makes me wonder why certain sectors seem to be moving in the opposite direction. 

It looks like today’s heatmap is showing a clear trend: sectors like consumer non-durables and health tech took a noticeable hit, while finance and tech stocks are up. Interesting to see how varied the reactions are across sectors—maybe it’s tied to post-election sentiments or a shift in investor focus? Anyone else noticing similar patterns in their portfolio?

2024-11-06,14:45:52,StockMarket,"Trump Election, How to Play","Stocks to be bullish on during a Trump term:

Oil: $XOP, $XOM, $SHEL, $MRO

C*****: $COIN, $MARA, $WULF

Big Bois - Apple: $MSFT, $NVDA, $AMZN etc

Military: $BA, $LMT, $RTX

Prison: CoreCivic ($CXW)

Sectors to be bearish on during a Trump term:

All renewable energy (except maybe nuclear)

Agriculture: immigrants make up significant amount of (cheap) labor for the sector

International shipping: tariffs and isolationist policy would be bad

Auto-manufacturing: parts coming from overseas will have tariffs

Low cost foreign retail like Shein and Temu equivalents will get hit hard by tariffs

⚠️Increased Volatility: Awaiting Action⚠️

Cannabis: Republicans have historically been tough on marijuana. It seemed like things would be par for the course once again until Trump said on Truth Social that he would be voting in favor of Amendment 3 in Florida which would make it completely legal for adults 21 and up. I suspect this was a grift, but he’s such a wildcard that maybe he really would go against the conservative grain.

$APPL: While I left it out of the Big Bois due to the China taxes being a bearish variable, I think it should still hold strong in the long term.  We’ll see

$TSM probably has the widest range of outcomes in the market imo. 
If Trump’s attitude toward China is legit-

Best Pro: $TSM sees increased demand from U.S. and allies who want to bypass China’s questionable supply chain.

Worst Con: $TSM still makes most of their money from China, who could retaliate in a number of ways

Least worst con: $TSM is still intertwined with China’s cheaper supply chain. A western supply chain would be more expensive and be time consuming to adopt.

Don’t even want to consider it possible, but anything less diplomatic than economic warfare with China would be drastic not only for $TSM but for the people of Taiwan, god forbid.

$DJT + $TSLA: boy oh boy🤢
Ironically, both of these companies are suffering from the same problem and are presenting the same solution.

Problem: half decent product, lacking a reliable consumer base

Solution: present people with a charismatic rich guy in hopes they will buy/use the product off of pure Ethos alone.

2024-11-06,13:57:20,StockMarket,Why Donald Trump’s Return Could Boost Demand for Robots – A Long-Term Investment Opportunity,"Hey everyone,

With Donald Trump making a return, I think there’s more to consider than just the political drama. Specifically, his policies could have a huge ripple effect on the labor market, especially in the service industry. Trump’s stance on illegal immigration means we could see a stronger push to reduce undocumented workers, which would lead to an even bigger labor shortage in industries like hospitality, food service, and logistics. If fewer workers are available, companies will likely have to fill that gap—and robots could be the answer.

That’s where robotics companies come in, especially ones like Tesla, Richtech Robotics (RR), and Serve Robotics. Tesla is aiming to make waves with its humanoid robots, while Serve Robotics focuses on last-mile delivery solutions in urban areas. But let’s talk about Richtech Robotics (RR) in particular because they’ve already got robots deployed and working in real-world environments, addressing exactly the kind of labor shortages we’re talking about. RR’s service robots are already in use across various industries, from restaurants to healthcare facilities, and they’re receiving high praise from clients for their reliability and efficiency. Their tech isn’t just conceptual—it’s been tested and proven, which gives them a solid foothold as demand grows.

And then there’s Elon Musk himself. If he ends up being involved in government restructuring, it wouldn’t be surprising to see him push for more automation within federal jobs too, given his passion for robotics and AI. If Musk advocates for more robots in both private and public sectors, we could see a huge surge in the robotics industry overall.

Sure, the attention is still on DJT stocks and virtual currency as short-term plays riding the Trump wave, but I see robotics as a sector with way more potential for sustainable growth. For those of us looking for long-term positions, robots could be the steady play we’re after, especially as the tech gets better and companies like RR, SERV continue proving their value in real-world applications.

Anyone else seeing this as a big moment to get into robotics stocks for the long haul?",TSLA,Tesla
2024-11-05,04:11:24,StockMarket,Educate me about stock ,"So, what happens to your stock when a company is split/broken up?

It looks to me like its best to sell before the break up is announced, definitely before the split, but maybe I'm wrong?   
It's assets are shrinking, right? its net worth should be split... no? 

Ugh, there's a character limit.   
I'll fill that with a story. So I've followed stock loosely over the years... some of the best deals I've seen were almost always Elon musk deals. I was actually there for the solar city merger... sadly didn't have seed money. I knew it was going to be an excellent deal but couldn't capitulate.   
also was there at the twitter purchased, where they locked in at a higher price than the stock was when he purchased. can you imagine? Grabbing tesla stock at 25 dollars a stock? it was an incredible deal.   
  
so you could have purchased it and then picked up a 10 dollar earning per stock... easy peasy. Elon has always been good money so far. 

I also was there when the game stop thing happen, again no seed money... and doge... and I also called it when it was time to sell gamestop (yes, I know, everyone was screaming hold to hold because screw wall street... but us hustlers were pushing the line for the hold bros, so you can hate it but it helped the cause. moot point, I was on the call but didnt have any action behind it).

> Third-quarter results were buoyed by Tesla turning a corner with the Cybertruck, which generated profit for the first time. Lower material costs, an expanding energy business and sales of regulatory credits to automakers that need help complying with emissions limits also contributed to Tesla’s best quarterly earnings in more than a year.

> Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk offered an upbeat outlook for 2025, citing the rollout of more affordable models that Tesla has yet to identify. “Something like 20% to 30% growth next year is my best guess,” he said on a webcast.

> Tesla’s shares jumped 22% Thursday in New York, the biggest gain since May 2013.

2024-10-23,23:21:58,StockMarket,Tesla shares jump 10% on profit beat as company benefits from environmental credits,"Tesla shares jumped 10% following a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report, driven by strong profit margins from environmental credits. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 72 cents, surpassing analysts’ forecasts of 58 cents, though revenue slightly missed expectations at $25.18 billion. Automotive revenue rose 2%, while energy generation and storage revenue surged 52%, showcasing Tesla’s growing diversification.

A significant contributor to Tesla's profitability came from $739 million in regulatory credits, which the company earns for producing only electric vehicles. These credits, essentially pure profit, helped bolster Tesla’s bottom line. Additionally, Tesla hit a milestone with 7 million vehicles produced and reported that its Cybertruck achieved a positive gross margin for the first time, despite quality challenges.

Looking ahead, Tesla expects modest growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024, even as it faces increasing competition, particularly from Chinese automakers and U.S. legacy brands ramping up their electric vehicle efforts. Some investors are also raising concerns over CEO Elon Musk’s political activities, questioning how it could influence Tesla's brand and stock performance amidst a highly competitive landscape. Despite these challenges, Tesla remains committed to launching more affordable models by 2025.

2024-10-21,18:00:28,StockMarket,Thoughts on GOOGLanalysis,"# Why I'm ALL-IN on GOOGLE.

**Potential Antitrust Breakup (I love this!)**

I anticipate an antitrust breakup could unlock even greater value for Google. If this happens, owning the company before the breakup means we would receive shares of each separated business unit, which will most def drive a higher valuation.

**Waymo, Waymo Waymo**

Google’s self-driving division, Waymo, is making significant strides. They recently announced they will be committing $5 billion to the unit over a multi-year period.

**A**. Waymo is already operating in San Francisco, Phoenix, and soon to be Los Angeles, it's safe to say they cracked autonomous driving.

**B**. Critics argue that Tesla can scale better and that Waymo's cars are too expensive. To that, I disagree. Even if each Waymo vehicle costs $100k, plus another $100k for ALL associated expenses (fleet distribution, compute power, maintenance, talent, etc.), that still buys you 5,000 vehicles (assuming a 1-billion allocation of their stated investment), if each vehicle completes 15 rides per day, that’s over 26 million rides annually.

**C**. These rides not only generate revenue but also valuable data for future improvements.

**D**. This creates a significant competitive moat for Google, reinforcing its long-term dominance. The recognised moat is when the stock soars!

**Isomorphic Labs and AlphaFold-3**

Google's business unit Isomorphic Labs, and AlphaFold, are making rapid breakthroughs in drug discovery and forming partnerships across the pharmaceutical industry. With a potential antitrust breakup, this unit could thrive as a standalone company and attract substantial public investment, positioning itself as a legitimate pharmaceutical/AI powerhouse.

**Overall AI Expertise**

While Google’s search business is under threat, it’s important to recognize their AI prowess. Google is integrating AI across all their platforms, I think they'll retain a significant share of the search market over the long term. Their AI capabilities are vastly underappreciated.

**Android**

Android is an enormous business that could benefit from a spinoff. As a standalone company, Android could unlock significant value.

I feel it's time to back up the dump truck and LOAD UP.

2024-10-11,15:14:20,StockMarket,I'm new to Stock Market and I don't understand stock valuations.,"
Hey! I'm really new to stock market and trading in general. I""m mainly a programmer and only a bystander in trading.

In 2020, I realized (even with all the controversy they had) Nvidia was doing *really* good, they also had their investments in a lot of technologies finally start to pay off and even if you exclude the c rypt0 frenzy it was somewhat clear that Nvidia was nourishing. At least to me as a programmer, I thought they had a ton of technological dominance and advancements in various areas. And especially in 2022 when AI stuff popped up, if it wasn't clear before that with all the research and investments they were doing in AI/ML space, like it should be clear by that point with image generation, LLMs and OpenAI popping off and all of them relying on Nvidia. But the stock price was still at 15 USD at maximum in 2022. At that time I had literally 0 knowledge in the stock market and thought ""Maybe this is Nvidia's value and this value includes all the new things and market is aware of Nvidia."" but in hindsight Nvidia was overly undervalued and the market was simply not aware of it. Maybe it was clear to me because Nvidia is in my domain but am I missing something?

For example, I also get the same vibes with Tesla. Yes it is crazily valued at the moment but still with the event they held yesterday and overall their direction, even if everyone hates Elon Musk, it also seems clear to me that Tesla will pack a lot more than what it currently is. The robotaxis, tesla robot, their battery techs, their knowledge in vision and ML and a lot more things will start to pay off eventually. After the event, I expected today to see a growth in Tesla but it was down by %3? Is everyone waiting a lower point of entry? Or are people just not impressed by the event and the promises? What am I not understanding and missing here?",TSLA,Tesla

2024-10-02,15:17:07,StockMarket,"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter","
Tesla’s stock slipped 3.5% in premarket trading after the company reported third-quarter delivery figures. The EV giant posted 462,890 deliveries and 469,796 vehicles produced, slightly below analyst expectations of 463,310 deliveries. While these numbers showed a year-over-year increase, Tesla’s growth rate appears to be slowing amidst intensifying competition, particularly in China from companies like BYD and Li Auto.

In the U.S., Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market, but competition is heating up. Rivian and legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors are making strides in the EV space. GM reported a 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter, but with just 32,100 units sold, Tesla’s lead remains substantial.

Tesla’s 2024 outlook remains uncertain, as executives have signaled a slower delivery growth rate compared to last year. Despite adding the highly anticipated Cybertruck to their lineup, the company faces challenges in maintaining momentum, particularly as investors focus on profit margins and the potential for further competition in the autonomous vehicle space.

Despite these challenges, Tesla’s stock surged 32% in the third quarter, erasing its losses for the year. Investors will be keeping a close eye on the company’s upcoming earnings report and marketing event, where Tesla is expected to reveal its latest advancements, including a potential robotaxi design.

2024-09-14,01:26:00,StockMarket,Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-hailing trips in Austin and Atlanta,"Uber is taking its partnership with Alphabet's Waymo to new heights, announcing plans to offer autonomous ride-hailing services in Austin and Atlanta starting in early 2025. This move comes after the duo's initial success with robotaxi services in Phoenix, and now Uber riders in these two cities will have the chance to hop into a driverless Waymo vehicle for certain trips—exclusively through the Uber app.

The expansion marks a significant step for Uber in the robotaxi game, following the company's sale of its self-driving division back in 2020. Since then, Uber has been leaning on partnerships with companies like Waymo, GM's Cruise, and U.K.-based Wayve to re-enter the autonomous vehicle space.

Uber shares popped 5% on the news, while Alphabet saw a 1% rise. Investors have been nudging Uber to ramp up its autonomous vehicle strategy, especially ahead of Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi event in October. Uber's shares are down 17% from their 52-week high, partly in response to the increased competition.

Waymo, which has been steadily gaining traction, reported doubling its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 in San Francisco. Waymo’s co-CEO, Tekedra Mawakana, expressed excitement about expanding to Austin and Atlanta, adding that they are exploring future Uber Eats integrations in these cities.

The competition in the self-driving space is heating up, and Uber's latest move aims to solidify its position alongside major players like Waymo and Cruise.

2024-09-12,21:23:25,StockMarket,Opportunity In Oracle,"I’ve been hearing how oracle expects 9% revenue growth for FY 25 they also said for Q3 and Q4 24 they had signed their largest contracts to date. 

I’ve also heard examples of how’d they’d apply their tech. One example tied to the medical industry. Say a doctor wanted to pull up past CT scans, MRIs, or other tests when meeting with a patient they can voice request these from Oracles database. Hospital,  physician offices, and dentists offices at least in my area always feel like they have some of the most outdated data systems I’ve ever seen. Whether or not hospital managers feel like forking out money to upgrade is another question, but if they were to upgrade to something this feels like it would actually improve efficiency.

I’ve heard from Oracle execs before around integration of AI in automating some data pulls. It seems like something that’s been on their radar for years. To me this seems like a value offering of their DBMS and their cloud Services. 

I’m a little skeptical on near term feasibility of the more complex things Oracle claims on automated analyses. In practice there’s so much nuance to data that I wouldn’t currently trust this to handle complex questions that require strategic thinking and business knowledge. So personally I don’t buy claims around complex analyses anytime soon. 

One other thing was Oracle is also quite literally designing data centers that would be powered by SMRs in addition to expanding their existing data center footprints. SMRs historically have been quite expensive to install, but curious to see if there are long term cost savings by doing this. 

It seems like they have a feasible vision for how the products can be used everyday and commercialized. On one hand you have companies like Tesla promising C-3PO and on the other hand companies like Oracle are promising something that feels much closer and real, with practical use cases.

What are other things you think might drive value or detract value to Oracle in the future. Do you think it’s overvalued (if so why?)? 

Also, did anyone have any interesting reads around this to share? Trying to learn more about their business plan. ",TSLA,Tesla

2024-09-04,04:02:37,StockMarket,Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives,"The problem areas in the USA: --------------------------

\*- The Schiller PE is at a very high level.  Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble.  So stocks are highly expensive.

\*- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022!  We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, 

\*-  World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle.  That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset.  Additionally the trade war hampers both sides.

\*- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels.

\*- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers.  You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term.  People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank.  However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials.  AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth.  AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales.  So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia.  This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW.  I don't own any MKSI.  This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording.  So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN.

Good areas: --------------------------------------

\*- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022.  one can see 

tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity

\*- Gasoline is lower than last year

\*- Retail sales are going fine, \[ per  a recent NPR radio article \]

Nuetral ----------------------------------------

\*- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023.  No more sales growth from people returning to work.  Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info.

\*- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

My one man's take ----------------

The problem areas are serious.  There is enough weight in the bear issues to cause the stock market to give up most of its gains this year.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

 reached a $1 trillion market capitalization on Wednesday, the first nontechnology company in the U.S. to score the coveted milestone.

Shares of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate have rallied more than 28% in 2024, far above the S&P 500′s 18% gain. The $1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” turns 94 years old.


The shares were up 0.8% to $696,502.02 on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet.

The milestone “is a testament to the firm’s financial strength and franchise value,” said Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research. “This is significant at a time when Berkshire represents one of the few remaining conglomerates in existence today.”

Unlike the six other companies in the trillion-dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen.

2024-08-27,17:16:22,StockMarket,Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he's been dumping the stock because no one wants the company's cars or robots,"Ross Gerber, a longtime Tesla shareholder, has expressed concern about the company's performance, stating that the used-car market is flooded with old Teslas. He recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla stock is stuck in a ""quagmire,"" prompting him to sell about $60 million worth of shares due to growing concerns about the carmaker's future.

Gerber, a vocal critic of Elon Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, revealed that he's reduced his Tesla holdings by about half, maintaining a $50 million stake. He cited a lack of confidence in Tesla's ability to achieve its goals, especially in selling more cars. ""I've been gradually lowering my position because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals they set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently,"" he said, downplaying the significance of Tesla's robotics and self-driving technology.Other Tesla investors are also becoming wary, with Tesla's stock down 13% this year amid declining sales, increased competition in China, and Musk's ongoing legal issues. Gerber noted that the market is saturated with used Teslas and mentioned his own difficulties in selling his Tesla at a fair price.

""It's really a quagmire when you have top-tier products but a CEO who's not fully engaged in the business or in selling cars,"" Gerber said. ""Sales are declining, and if you're expecting a stellar quarter, you're mistaken. Tesla is mainly selling cars at a discount now.""

Despite some analysts suggesting Tesla is undervalued as an AI company, Gerber is skeptical. He believes the demand for Tesla's humanoid robots will be minimal, especially given Musk's erratic behavior and his controversial overhaul of Twitter into X. ""The simplest way to gauge interest is to ask around, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' The answer is likely zero,"" Gerber remarked. ""Who would trust it? The last thing I need is a robot made by Elon Musk in my house."" Musk's leadership has faced increasing scrutiny from both investors and lawmakers. Recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board, urging them to ensure Musk is fulfilling his financial obligations to Tesla shareholders.

2024-08-22,00:22:57,StockMarket,"Waymo says it has doubled its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 since May","Waymo has marked a major milestone by doubling its weekly paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. to over 100,000, a significant jump from the 50,000 rides reported in May. This growth was highlighted by co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana on LinkedIn, showcasing the rapid expansion of Waymo's services across major cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin, and Los Angeles. Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, is not only increasing its service reach but also advancing its technology. The company recently introduced its ""generation 6"" self-driving system, which is designed to operate in a broader range of weather conditions while requiring fewer expensive sensors, signaling a leap forward in autonomous driving.

Backing these technological advancements, Alphabet announced in July that it would inject an additional $5 billion into Waymo. This investment underscores Alphabet's commitment to extending Waymo's robotaxi service beyond its current markets, primarily in the Sun Belt states. With a fleet of around 700 vehicles, Waymo has been steadily expanding its operations, including new service areas in San Francisco and a significant enlargement of its coverage in Phoenix. These expansions position Waymo as a leader in the autonomous vehicle market, even as it continues to innovate and scale its operations.

Despite growing competition globally, particularly in China from companies like Didi and Pony.ai, Waymo remains at the forefront of the U.S. robotaxi market. Competitors like GM's Cruise have faced setbacks, temporarily halting their driverless services, while Tesla has yet to fulfill its long-promised driverless vehicle capabilities. As Waymo continues to grow and enhance its offerings, it solidifies its position as a dominant player in the emerging autonomous vehicle industry.

2024-08-12,23:56:32,StockMarket,"Tesla Stops Taking Orders For Its Least Expensive Cybertruck ($61K), Cheapest Cybertruck Now Costs $99,990 ","Tesla has quietly stopped taking orders on its entry-level Cybertruck, which was originally priced at $61,000, leaving the $100,000 version as the new starting point for potential buyers. This move is a significant shift from the initial promises made by CEO Elon Musk, who in 2019 projected that the Cybertruck would cost around $40,000 and deliver over 500 miles on a single charge. Now, the least expensive model available is the dual-motor Foundation series, which is priced at $99,990 and offers a 318-mile range. This model is available for delivery as soon as this month, while the higher-end $119,990 tri-motor Cyberbeast, which has a 301-mile range, is expected to be delivered starting in October.

Despite Musk's earlier claims of having over 1 million reservations, some analysts believe that interest in the truck may not be as strong as initially expected, especially for the higher-priced models. Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse Insights, noted that this latest move ""shows that demand is a lot less than a million trucks,"" particularly for those who were holding out for a more affordable option.

Tesla's shift to prioritize its more expensive models is a clear signal that the company is focusing on maximizing profitability, even if it means pricing out a significant portion of its potential customer base. The Cybertruck, with its unconventional trapezoidal design inspired by the ""Blade Runner"" movie and its stainless-steel body, has certainly captured the imagination of many, but the reality of its pricing and range limitations may dampen enthusiasm for some.

Sales figures show that Tesla sold nearly 4,800 Cybertrucks in July, marking its best month yet and making it the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. priced over $100,000. However, maintaining this level of sales at such high price points could prove to be a challenge. A spokesperson for Cox Automotive commented that while Tesla has sold more than 16,000 units so far, ""sustained high volume at that price point will be a challenge,"" reflecting the potential difficulty Tesla may face in maintaining strong sales numbers without a more affordable option in the lineup.

The Cybertruck’s journey to market has been fraught with delays and challenges, with deliveries only beginning in November 2023 after years of setbacks and a difficult production ramp-up. With the latest pricing strategy, Tesla seems to be betting on the allure of its high-end models to carry the day, but whether this gamble will pay off remains to be seen.

2024-08-06,19:05:28,StockMarket,Possible Bullish Thesis on Hertz,"I know, I know - investors or traders have gotten the shaft on this ticker, but hear me out.

Hertz ran into *more* issues post-covid travel restrictions when Tesla marked down the price of their vehicles and accelerated the depreciation of said assets on their books (PP&E on balance sheet). There has also been seasonality regarding sales, profitability, and consumer spending is relatively contractionary for the overall sector. Their earnings have obviously been unsatisfactory, and there's been leadership and financial restructuring to *try* get things back on track. IDC about any of that really, what I care about is the strategic mistake to accelerate the sale of their EVs given the low utilization rate of EVs by their customers in the Hertz fleet.

Hertz is positioned to have one of the largest robo-taxi fleets in the world, second to only Tesla themselves to my knowledge, and Tesla can't position fleets everywhere *yet*.

* After Tesla began seriously teasing investors with the idea, companies like Lyft and Uber corrected, hard, while Hertz reached a bottom @ <$3/share with upside volatility characteristics.
* Hertz is trading at well below book value, and the PP&E depreciation will decelerate once Teslas become a profitable investment (i.e., rideshare fees > depreciation & maintenance).
* The low utilization rate by Hertz's customers will be moot if the fleet is automatically participating robo-ridesharing. They will be utilized, at least more so than previous reporting periods.

If Hertz slows or ceases selling their EVs for short term liquidity, once robo-taxi platform rolls out, Hertz has a new revenue stream with their existing assets. The depreciation will slow or reverse, their low utilization rate will subside, and their profitability will increase dramatically.

There's a lot of ***ifs*** in this scenario, but if this happens, I think Hertz will *at least* trade at book value ( > $6.25/share) indicating over 75% upside by the end of this year. If profitability continued to grow from robo-taxi fees, and if Hertz accomplishes higher profitability over the next several years from this while increasing utilization rates, their EPS will go profitable again which if sustainable we're looking at over $10-20/share in the coming years.

> “After testing the first beta version of Apple Intelligence myself, I can tell you that the features don’t yet live up to the excitement. In their current state, they’re a far cry from the game-changing technology that fans and investors hope Apple Intelligence will become.”

> “You even see some analysts describing it as **a breakthrough akin to the original iPhone.”**

> “Let me be clear: At this point, Apple Intelligence isn’t that.”

> Now, it’s true that this is just the first beta release and the company will undoubtedly improve it over the next few months. But I suspect that we’re seeing a fairly good picture of what Apple Intelligence will look like when it debuts around October. 

> “I found the ability to summarize emails to be useful: It provided an excellent distillation of the message’s content. This is particularly a perk for message previews, which typically just show the first few lines of an email. But the summaries of text message conversations — particularly for fast-moving group chats — were a disappointment and mostly useless. Summaries are also helpful in Safari for articles, but I don’t foresee that being a particularly popular feature. “

> “The most impressive features so far are Writing Tools, Type to Siri and phone-call recording summaries. The Writing Tools are essentially a well-integrated version of Grammarly-style features. It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that’s been available on Android phones for a while now.”

> “The most impressive features so far are Writing Tools, Type to Siri and phone-call recording summaries. The Writing Tools are essentially a well-integrated version of Grammarly-style features. It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that’s been available on Android phones for a while now.”

> “I was less impressed with the reply suggestions in Messages, which don’t immediately seem like a major upgrade over the existing keyboard suggestions in iOS. They could be a lot more thoughtful, perhaps by better using the context of the chat so far, rather than just the last message in the thread.”

> “The best feature is the ability to record a phone call and get a transcript of the conversation as well as a summary of what took place. In my tests, this has worked almost flawlessly, and the summaries have been excellent. It’s certainly a nice time saver.”

> “Type to Siri is also a nice upgrade, as is the new visual cue that Siri is active on the iPhone, iPad and CarPlay. But neither of those interface improvements has anything to do with AI.”

> “In any case, these are mainly niceties, not necessities.”

2024-08-02,03:16:06,StockMarket,Amazon reports revenue miss for second quarter and issues disappointing guidance,"Amazon's shares took a hit on Thursday, sliding as much as 6% in after-hours trading following the company's report of weaker-than-expected second-quarter revenue and a less-than-stellar forecast for the current quarter. Despite strong performance in its cloud division, Amazon's advertising unit underperformed, adding to investor concerns.

**By the Numbers:**

* **Earnings per share:** $1.26 (vs. $1.03 expected)
* **Revenue:** $147.98 billion (vs. $148.56 billion expected)
* **Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue:** $26.3 billion (vs. $26 billion expected)
* **Advertising revenue:** $12.8 billion (vs. $13 billion expected)
* **Q3 revenue forecast:** $154 billion to $158.5 billion (mid-point: $156.25 billion vs. $158.24 billion expected)
* **Year-to-date stock performance:** +21%

Amazon's core retail business continued to face challenges, with sales in its online stores segment growing just 5% year over year. Competition from discount platforms like Temu and Shein has intensified, forcing Amazon to adapt by launching a new discount store targeting budget-conscious consumers.

Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky noted that the revenue miss was partly due to consumers opting for lower-priced items, which led to a drop in average selling prices (ASP). This cautious consumer behavior, combined with the distraction of global events such as the Olympics and the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, contributed to the company's conservative guidance for the third quarter.

While Amazon's cloud division, AWS, exceeded expectations with 19% growth, it still lags behind competitors Microsoft and Google, which reported cloud growth of 29%. Amazon's advertising unit also posted a 20% increase in revenue, but it fell short of analyst estimates and lagged behind rivals like Meta, which saw 22% growth in ad revenue.

Net income for Amazon more than doubled from the previous year, reflecting extensive cost-cutting measures across the company. However, the challenges in its core retail and advertising businesses, coupled with the conservative guidance, have raised concerns about Amazon's growth trajectory in the coming quarters.

2024-08-01,20:14:38,StockMarket,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

2024-07-31,22:22:58,StockMarket,"Meta shares pop on revenue and earnings beat, better than expected forecast","Meta shares soared approximately 7% in after-hours trading on Wednesday following the company’s announcement that it surpassed Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings. The social media giant also issued an upbeat forecast for the current period, further boosting investor confidence.

Meta, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, continues to pour significant resources into artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR), key areas of focus for the company as it looks to maintain its competitive edge and drive future growth.

The Numbers:
Earnings per share: $5.16 vs. $4.73 expected by LSEG

Revenue: $39.07 billion vs. $38.31 billion expected by LSEG

Q3 revenue guidance: $38.5 billion to $41 billion vs. $39.1 billion expected

Q2 revenue growth: 22% year-over-year, rising from $32 billion to $39.07 billion

Expenses: $24.2 billion in Q2, including a $1.4 billion charge from a facial recognition data lawsuit settlement in Texas

Capital expenditures: $8.47 billion in Q2, lower than the $9.51 billion expected

Full-year expense outlook: Unchanged at $96 billion to $99 billion

Capital expenditures forecast: Increased to $37 billion to $40 billion from a previous range of $35 billion to $40 billion

Daily active people (DAP): 3.27 billion, in line with estimates

Headcount: Down 1% year-over-year to 70,799 as of June 30, 2024

Key Highlights:
Meta’s second-quarter revenue showed a robust 22% increase compared to the same period last year, marking the fourth consecutive quarter with revenue growth exceeding 20%. This impressive growth comes as Meta ramps up its investments in AI and VR, which are increasingly seen as critical to the company’s long-term strategy.

The company’s expenses for the second quarter totaled $24.2 billion, partly due to a substantial $1.4 billion charge related to a facial recognition data lawsuit settlement in Texas. Despite these expenses, Meta's capital expenditures came in lower than expected at $8.47 billion, compared to the $9.51 billion analysts had anticipated.

Looking ahead, Meta provided a revenue guidance range of $38.5 billion to $41 billion for the third quarter, surpassing analyst expectations of $39.1 billion. However, the company slightly adjusted its capital expenditures outlook upward to a range of $37 billion to $40 billion for the year.

In terms of user metrics, Meta reported 3.27 billion daily active people (DAP) across its family of apps, which was in line with StreetAccount estimates. The company’s headcount saw a slight decline, down 1% year-over-year to 70,799 as of June 30, 2024.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed confidence in Meta’s AI initiatives, stating, ""We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year. We've released the first frontier-level open-source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we're driving good growth across our apps.""

Overall, Meta’s strong financial performance and positive outlook suggest that the company is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory, even as it navigates significant investments in new technologies and ongoing regulatory challenges.

2024-07-12,16:42:07,StockMarket,How This Door Handle Cost Tesla Half Of My Investment💸,"Today I arrived in Bangkok with my girlfriend and ordered us to Grab (Taxi) to get us to the hotel. I've heard about BYD before and that it's the Chinese Tesla, but I'd never expected to be driven in one of those cars for $2.63 through the midst of Bangkok traffic for over 30 minutes.

If you take a look at the design features and changes Tesla's made over the last couple of years, the companies beginning and Elon Musk of course, it's obvious that they're trying to revolutionize the electric vehicle market with features like the Yoke Steering Wheel, the outer door handles and much much more.

However, if you look at the company BYD, how cheap they are producing their vehicles, how amazing the design and the quality is in general, you won't be able not to be amazed what China's done in that regard as well.

One thing that struck me the most is the inner door handle...

https://preview.redd.it/lyt5r3kmn3cd1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe179e72d777caf49e6d8c0e66ec800f6f39d34a

Sounds weird, but think about it: How either unnatural or unnecessarily cumbersome are the inner handles of car doors?

Either you have to pull the handle with one arm and push the door with the other handle, or you bend your fingers in an unnatural angle to the side, pulling in a curve to push the door open with your elbow.

This might not be one of the most important topics when talking about a car and most people probably never thought of this as a problem or inconvenient, but if you've read the book Atomic habits, you might know where I'm going with this.

James Clear at one point goes into detail about a racing bike team that improved every single little detail in their lifes to get every little advantage over the competition they could get.

Needless to say that after dozens of little improvements, they became impressively successful, making history for their country in this sport.

I believe the same to be true for companies, their culture, their product and their team. And in the case of BYD it definitely applies in a bunch of cases, just like it did with Tesla a couple of years ago (and still does).

I've been an investor in Tesla since 2016 because I believed in the product and Elon Musk and made good money owning the stock, however with Tesla becoming/being a blue chip stock, not a growth stock anymore the percentage gain is going to be limited compared to BYD, which is until now rarely represented in the western world compared to Tesla.

Tesla's got a Market Cap of 839.59 Billion vs BYD being at 96.16 Billion, which would mean BYD has about an 8x to go until it catches up with Tesla. And I'm expecting higher prices on Tesla too...

When I talked to a friend at Mercedes a couple of days ago, he told me that China's investing so much money into the research of Electric Vehicles and the development of batteries that many European projects and car companies already gave up as they don't have the funding and resources provided by the Chinese Government.

Seeing how China's developed over the last 10 - 20 years and investments into modern technology, they've already passed by most Western countries, if they keep that trajectory going, they'll be miles ahead 10 years from now.

Long story short, I'm looking for advice. I have a combined $8k in these accounts and I'm a firm believer in the cost of not doing something just as much as the cost of doing something. Should I bail and close out on my losses or hold for changing tides? Should I be strategic and bail for tax purposes? Half are in a Roth IRA that I converted from a 401k a year ago. Other half is in a Vanguard brokerage account. 

I'm heavy into VOO (60%) with other investments in GOOG, META, NVDA, MSFT, GH, AMZN, AAPL so I would probably dump it into VOO or research some higher growth, more risky opportunity.

2024-07-11,03:31:49,StockMarket,Nike is a bargain right now ,"Right now, these prices are an absolute fire sale. Maybe I missed the part where people are going to stop buying nike worldwide. Apparely Nike has less going for it than it did in 2018! I mean just look at this chart below that covers 10 years:

https://preview.redd.it/iu6j7po4esbd1.png?width=1911&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c1f26a35134503bac803a0e66745e0570dd984

You have a volume read of 129,996,982 on June 28th. Right now the markets are highly infactuated with tech stocks and things like TSLA or PLTR. Something boring like Nike is far from the excitement anyone is looking for as new ATH's are being made every day on QQQ or SPY. Theres nothing sexy about it at all. 

This is where the best prices can be obtained. No one wants the stock. So few people  want the stock that they are willing to actually sell it at prices first seen May 25th 2018. Even in 2020 with a full blown pandemic breaking out with unknown consequences only saw Nike hang out below this price for a whopping 7 trading days. Lil trip down and V shape recovery. 

Even from a pure volume only perspective the following shows some interesting things: 

https://preview.redd.it/1bzv8typfsbd1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1d49c9ce85029ead6b011b9f6e80c6212a4aedc

The lowest volume day is about 15.95M for any day since the big drop. The volume on the day of the big drop is unprecedented. The 2nd highest volume day in the last decade was 12/23/2015. Hilariously almost around the same price! The high of that day back then was 68.20 and was a new all time high. 

The difference with large volume down here is its the opposite. Large amounts of demand are showing up down here. In the past the big volume was correlated with being near big highs. But Nike wasnt even near its high right before it dropped either. 

So what I would say is that finding a bottom is a matter of flushing people out. You gotta get to that point where even the most committed person who would have a 1% chance of selling pre earnings is now ready to and currently selling. Thats probably going on and we couldn't sport such volume down here if there wasn't some equal demand. The price has not moved much. You have a high there of 79.05 and we are down to about 72 now. 

Lets just look at the actual income here: 

https://preview.redd.it/xzur7vt5hsbd1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af40a030a7bcd30e707eced540bcd4b524d0718

Over the last 10 years, the revenue is only going up. Even if the company is faltering so to speak, these prices are far from connected to the reality of actual income. 

Check out the P/E below

[https:\/\/www.macrotrends.net\/stocks\/charts\/NKE\/nike\/pe-ratio](https://preview.redd.it/txpvgitihsbd1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c906deacc2aff197edbf483fb08d2f96ff77eb9)

Even right here you can see that right now Nike is sporting a P/E that looks to be just over 20. But its actually even lower and this chart is delayed: 

[https:\/\/www.macrotrends.net\/stocks\/charts\/NKE\/nike\/pe-ratio](https://preview.redd.it/clkllnaqhsbd1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=1086c990d16ec783406e0232352d91dd436b1460)

The last time the P/E was under 18.30 was Nov of 2011...

  
Now heres what I do know. Alot of fund managers are going to be looking at these beautiful pictures over the coming weeks/months:

https://preview.redd.it/k89wawq9isbd1.png?width=1911&format=png&auto=webp&s=584b84419187792d995cf8564dd1b2a8b2634a30

They are going to potentially sell some of those wildly running high stocks. Then they will be sitting on some cash they need to find another play for. All of a sudden, seemingly out of nowhere on your favorite stock channel, all the analysts will be upgrading nike. Show hosts and guests will be talking about how the stock is too cheap and all that fun fancy stuff they do AFTER they bought the ol dippity skippity. They are going to have to do something with the money. They will see Nike. I doubt  they will just pass it up. 

Since  the fed hasnt cut rates yet, theres nothing to really worry about. Even when that happens markets should run a good 3-5% further before they tap out from whatever caused the fed to cut in the first place. 

Now lastly, what brought me to this trade idea at all? Adobe. How did Adobe lead you to see something in Nike? I remember 2022.

https://preview.redd.it/oj4sxjz7ksbd1.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=1865e6cf78f673a4d37ae4b46ff9aeb0e85f2271

In 2022, there was a big gap down and this brought Adobe to prices not 1st achieved since Sept of 2018. I passed this one up. I let the fear keep me out of the trade. Surely everyone who was selling was correct. Obviously thats the crowd that always wins. 

Since we are dealing with panic, lets get up close and examine how the panic works: 

https://preview.redd.it/xrmmklaxksbd1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=7998168ec3829f129b26d6c91fabde81a34a86d5

The day of panic was mid Sept and a bottom was put in over the  next two weeks. It did however fight against going higher. You can see that in those micro higher lows leading into mid Nov where it said goodbye to those lows permenantly. So quite clearly any attempts to make the stock run in the near term should be expected to be stamped out. Espeically if we see a run back up to 78. It will probably have to retest its low whatever it is a couple of times over the coming months. 

Quite clearly those retests whenever they happen SHOULD end higher on that day as they did with adobe there. That would be a sign of people buying the dip 10/10. 

It won't happen overnight, but I do think the stock could fill its gap within the next 3-4 months. Even if things get ""bad"" around the election period, Nike already got the business. 

TLDR; Everyone hates Nike so you should love it long time. Thats all you really need to know. ",TSLA,Tesla

Roughly 2 years ago I saw my first Rivian truck in the wild in my local suburbs of Cincinnati… since then I’ve seemingly seen more and more every month. 

Is this is similar trend in other cities in the US? - if so does this mean Rivian may be a worthy investment? … I haven’t researched the company much but feel like this is a trend worth noting that has me interested in investing. 

So I ask : is this reason enough to invest in Rivian? Could its business model follow the footsteps of Tesla (or even come remotely close?) at $15 a share I’m beginning to get FOMO and asking myself “why not buy 100 shares and see what happens?” 

Do any of you own Rivian stock? If you had $1500 buying power to spare in a $60k portfolio would you take a risk on Rivian? If not what would you buy instead?

2024-06-27,19:19:03,StockMarket,RIVN: To Buy or Not to Buy? A Comprehensive Analysis,"There's been a lot of discussion about Rivian (RIVN) lately, with opinions split between supporters and skeptics. Some are even comparing RIVN to Tesla, with analyst Gary Black suggesting ""RIVN today is like TSLA in 2019."" Let's break down the pros and cons of RIVN as we know them:

# Positive Factors

The main factor is Volkswagen's recent $5B investment, which has significantly extended the liquidity runway.

[Data by The Asian Investor, seekingalpha.com](https://preview.redd.it/yaykx1avd59d1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea76e2e72d388f4e794ba64a8eadeb11da8f97ee)

**Additional key considerations:**

1. Strong balance sheet with $7.9B cash/investments as of Q1 2024
2. New factory in progress + tax incentives for existing facility
3. Positive sentiment around trucks and vans, with super loyal fanbase
4. R&D in Serbia, reducing costs
5. Shifting to base platform + add-ons model
6. New R2 model has more reservations than total yearly production
7. Potential for expanded partnerships.
8. Expected gross profit by year-end could boost stock to $20-25 range

Thanks to u/bluecap for additional insights from previous discussion.

# Challenges

Declining cash balance and high cash burn rate during production ramp-up since FY 2022 is a main risk.

[RIVN Cash and Short Term investments, takeprofit.com](https://preview.redd.it/dj9jdw6yd59d1.png?width=2545&format=png&auto=webp&s=feb6a6813e1d3d7941e1835d5639766028a1af9f)

Competition from established automakers and Chinese EV manufacturers is important to consider as the market becomes increasingly competitive.

# Valuation & Analyst Perspectives

[RIVN Stock 12 Month Forecast, tipranks.com](https://preview.redd.it/evxt8x21e59d1.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=51f1f91cd661bec281181c3867551233db3ac1c4)

* Current P/S ratio of 1.8x, below 3-year average of 3.0x
* Average 12-month price target from 23 analysts: **$14.52** (range $8-$21)

# Technical Analysis

[Chart and analysis by takeprofit.com\/@mustermann84](https://preview.redd.it/7nc6yyt3e59d1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc8530008238aa27c0566f25c1875b06e5b5bded)

* Weekly chart indicates a possible trend reversal (depicted as a ""Black Swan"" pattern resembling a head and shoulders formation)
* Possible interim price targets in identified cluster zones
* MACD indicates a potential long-term reversal 

# Conclusion

Rivian's profile has improved significantly, addressing previous concerns. The Volkswagen investment is a game-changer for risk mitigation. However, cash burn remains a concern, with negative free cash flow of $1.5B in Q1 2024. The new investment extends the runway to 8-9 quarters, reducing immediate financial pressure.

I will closely monitor Rivian's performance and how it handles challenges, especially from Chinese rivals.

2024-06-27,17:49:06,StockMarket,Rivian / The technology merger with VW has awakened the Black Swan pattern.,"# Expectations for both companies are very high and could be a significant step against competitors from the Far East. Will this be enough to keep the German automotive industry competitive?

# The weekly chart currently presents a noteworthy situation.

[Black Swan Pattern ](https://preview.redd.it/uoymop1yx49d1.png?width=3660&format=png&auto=webp&s=63fbaa0ad8bbdfd7e3a140f33213bd35c1adb1a7)

# 

 There is a so-called Black Swan pattern, which in technical analysis stands for a trend reversal. The target determination of this harmonic pattern typically occurs in two retracements.

* The smaller Fibonacci is the so-called conservative retracement.
*  The longer-term Fibonacci is called the aggressive retracement.

For the technical analyst, the cluster zones marked in the yellow boxes are of particular interest as possible (interim) price targets. In this context, the open gap and the MACD are also noteworthy, structurally represented as a head and shoulders formation on the chart. 

How do you view the merger, and do you see a realistic chance for VW to assert itself against BYD and Tesla with this collaboration? The chart at least offers a perspective on a fruitful collaboration.",TSLA,Tesla

I understand some things have been proven over time, like ETFs boglehead philosophy etc. time in the market over timing the market but what about words like ""be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy?""


When you are young, let's say early 20s, this is the time to take risks isn't it? Every right risk you take now, compounds like crazy, every mistake? You are young you can still recover and learn.



I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued?



For example, I am a software/hardware engineering student, and I was a gamer as a child. I knew a lot about companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not, AMD would blow intel out of the way, QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge, but if it's enough for me to believe in working for these companies, isn't it enough to invest let's say 10%, 20%? Instead of dumping all into HYSA T bills and VTI/VOO VXUS etc and using 5% for individual picks?



If shit goes down market goes down, I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes, I had 10k savings from my first internship, I could have bought these shares I believed so much in, but I didn't, it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia, but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don't think I should work for the tech industry right? 



If tech fails I fail because thats what I'm going into, and if I can risk my career for a job in such a ""volatile"" market then why can't I ""risk"" 30-50% of my portfolio in the same tier companies?



Can someone experienced help me out with these thoughts? To me at this age it seems like VOO will get you the american dream comfortably, but VOO and good picks will make you rich, and if the market really fails dotcom and whatnot, you have to keep faith in the market and keep earning, some company will rise and if you are in the scene you will know about it, right?

I'm looking for some advice regarding my investments. In 2021, I bought several individual stocks, mostly driven by the hype at the time and thinking I could be a trader (i am not). However I'm now considering selling them to move my capital into an ETF. I don't plan to use this money for at least the next 10 years.

I should say my main investment money is in ETFs already. but I handpicked this stocks thinking i could beat the market, lol.

Here is a table showing the stocks I own, their current performance to date

|Company|Current Performance|

|Nintendo|-10%|
|Coinbase|-32%|
|PayPal|-45%|
|NIO|-86%|

2024-06-12,15:59:31,StockMarket,Fear that I've already missed out (the opposite of FOMO)?,"I have a bad tendency to see a company or industry and think ""heh... I wish I bought in a few years ago. Then, rather than buying in with that realization, I talk myself out of it. ""How much more can it really go up?"" I don't know... Examples: Netflix and UNH in 2015ish. LLY when it was $200. I've since watch both explode and its like ""damn! why did I talk myself out of those positions when I knew I still liked those companies?"" Those are the most obvious misses I've made.

I'm curious how you determine when you've missed your opportunity. I'm not worried about stocks that I was never interested in. I don't care if I missed Tesla because it was something I never felt I understood enough to want. I dodged a bullet with the marijuana crazy because I didn't think most companies were a safe long-term bet. But, there were stocks that I wanted to buy but didn't have the liquidity to pick up then when I got the liquidity, I'm like ""is now the best time to buy? Its already doubled since I was ready to enter."" 

I'm currently don't have much liquidity so I'm not buying. But, by the end of the year, I should have $20-30k freed up. And, if some of the stocks I'm currently interested in go up, I might get it in my head that I missed the opportunity already and just put the money somewhere ""safer."" Besides the argument that over an x number of years, almost all stocks go up... what other methodology do you use to determine whether you should still buy a stock and when to admit that you've missed out.",TSLA,Tesla

I am researching companies slowly building my portfolio in stocks after I turned over losses from COVID that were long overdue. I work full time and I am mom of a toddler. As I mentioned above, I am slowly building my portfolio to earn returns from losses and invest in short and long term stocks. I enjoy the DD aspect. Specifically, I perform AML DD and research future eps growth on companies.

Here is my portfolio:

1. OUST just JOINED the RUSSELL 3000, look on page 4 here: [www.lseg.com/content/dam/ftse-russell/en\_us/documents/other/ru3000-additions-preliminary-20240524.pdf](http://www.lseg.com/content/dam/ftse-russell/en_us/documents/other/ru3000-additions-preliminary-20240524.pdf)

If you don't know whats coming, you will get left behind like trash.

Most or the world will start buying OUST in about 3-5 years when it is well over 100 a share, and I will be on to my next move, years ahead of the random people who know nothing of how LIDAR is going to change our lives forever.

4. The CEO is awesome at what he does(Angus), he also keeps buying shares, he also doesn't pay himself like an asshole, so when he buys share it means a lot more then lets say Elon Musk buying some TSLA.

5. Now that OUST is in the RUSSELL 3000 every month lots of BIG MM funds will be buying OUST by BUYING the RUSSELL 3000 and ETFs.

Now on to a little rant.

If I can tell you 1 thing for 2024 it is BUY OUST while you still can, I don't see this under $20.00 for more than a week or two, three tops.

I may not know shit about stocks like GOOG and AMZN but I know OUST and I know it well.

IYKYK. STAY CHILL AND KEEP BUYING

P.S. If you want to see my proof look at my older posts. here is a pic of my last OUST trade.

In 2012, I was one of the first people in my circle to invest in Tesla. I remember talking to my friends and coworkers about how Elon was going to take over the planet with EVs and improve everyone's lives. I was proud to be a Tesla shareholder. That was all I talked about for months. I read all the press releases, earnings reports, and niche forums to extract information about the company's future. I even flew to some of their events, lol.

Nowadays, it feels like most people (including myself) care less about what the companies they invest in stand for.

1. Do you guys still feel proud to be shareholders of XYZ?
2. How important is it for you to share the values of the companies in your portfolio?
3. How much emphasis do you put on a company's values before investing?

Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic but there's no way we all just became speculators...",TSLA,Tesla

The company was founded by Brian Cumins in November 1984 and is headquartered in Perth, Australia.

**From the company reports:**

Cash Converters International (ASX: CCV) has released its first-quarter FY25 trading update, showcasing steady financial performance and operational resilience.

The company’s Gross Loan Book remained consistent at $274 million, reflecting robust customer demand. Quarterly revenue rose by 1% year-on-year to $95.8 million, driven by strong trading results in the UK and sustained momentum in the Australian business.

A key highlight was the improvement in the Quarterly Net Loss Rate, which decreased to 3.7% from 4.8% in the prior comparable period (pcp). This reduction aligns with the company’s target range and underscores its focus on sustainable, customer-centered financial solutions.

**Growth Catalyst:**

CCV has solidified its position as a key player in the Australian personal finance market, particularly in the small and medium loan segment, which represents a $4 billion target market. The company’s strategic focus on younger audiences, a demographic underpenetrated by traditional banks, offers significant growth potential. By addressing the financial needs of consumers under 45 years old, CCV taps into a dynamic and expanding customer base. CCV’s growth strategy encompasses both organic and inorganic initiatives. The company continues to strategically expand its loan book while maintaining an emphasis on cost optimization, ensuring sustained profitability. Its commitment to geographic and inorganic expansion is evident in recent milestones. For instance, the acquisition of 42 stores in the UK in July 2023 has already contributed significantly to earnings in FY24. Similarly, in Australia, CCV acquired three stores and has a robust pipeline of 39 additional stores, establishing a strong foundation for future revenue growth. The company’s greenfield development projects further support its expansion, demonstrating its capability to penetrate new markets effectively. These combined efforts underscore CCV’s potential to strengthen its market presence and drive long-term financial performance.

 

# 2. Hancock & Gore Limited (ASX: HNG)

Hancock & Gore Ltd. is an investment company. The firm invests in diversified asset categories, including listed and unlisted equities and private equity investments. The company was founded on October 29, 1904 and is headquartered in Sydney, Australia.

**Historical Financial Analysis:**

The company experienced a remarkable operational transformation in 2021 following its recapitalization in 2020. Prior to this change, the company boasted a robust revenue stream, generating nearly $40 million from various segments, including Building Products, Healthcare, and Health & Beauty. However, despite this substantial revenue, the company faced challenges in achieving healthy profit margins. Since 2021, although revenues have decreased and are now solely derived from its investment portfolio, the company has managed to report impressive profits, amounting to $8.17 million in 2023 compared to only $1.1 million in 2019, despite revenues of only $5.58 million. The recapitalization also positively impacted the company’s balance sheet, allowing for a significant increase in assets from $35 million in 2020 to $70 million in 2023. Concurrently, liabilities, which stood at nearly $20 million in 2020, have diminished to less than $1 million, thereby substantially improving the book value for shareholders.

**Growth Catalyst:**

The recent acquisition of Schoolblazer by the company, following its increased investment in Mountcastle to achieve full ownership, represents a strategically advantageous decision. This acquisition is anticipated to enable the company to capture a substantially larger portion of the market, as Schoolblazer is strategically aligned with core competencies that Mountcastle currently lacks, and vice versa. The synergy between these complementary business models is expected to lead to a significant increase in market share for Mountcastle, especially considering that Schoolblazer expands Mountcastle’s footprint from the Value and Mid consumer market segments through its established presence in the Premium market segment.",TSLA,Tesla
2025-01-24,08:09:56,pennystocks,"Amprius Technologies (AMPX), my DD and conclusions.","TL;DR: Why Amprius Is a Hidden Gem
Amprius Technologies makes next-level batteries with crazy-high energy density, way better than standard lithium-ion batteries. These batteries are lighter, charge faster, and last longer. Their tech is already in demand for electric vehicles (EVs), drones, and aerospace. With a new factory coming online and revenue expected to skyrocket, AMPX looks like a solid bet in the booming clean energy market.

1. What They Do
Amprius specializes in silicon nanowire anode batteries. Translation? Their batteries pack more power (double the energy density) into a smaller, lighter package compared to regular lithium-ion batteries. Imagine an EV that can go farther on a single charge or a drone that can fly longer—this is why companies like Airbus and DARPA are already working with them.

2. Why Now?
Massive Market Growth: EVs, drones, and clean energy tech are exploding. The EV market alone is expected to grow by 23% annually through 2030.
New Factory Coming Online: Amprius’ Colorado factory will start producing batteries at scale in 2024. This will double their production capacity in 2025 and pave the way for even bigger growth in the years ahead.
Real Revenue: They made $85M in 2024 (+55% YoY) and are projecting $130M for 2025, with improving profit margins.

3. Why Their Batteries Are Game-Changing
Lighter and More Powerful: Energy density of up to 500 Wh/kg, compared to 250-300 Wh/kg in regular batteries.
Super Fast-Charging: Cuts charging times by up to 70%.
Long-Lasting: Built to handle tough conditions—perfect for defense, drones, and EVs.

4. Who’s Buying?
Amprius isn’t just some “future promise” company; big players are already working with them.
Aerospace & Defense: Airbus and DARPA (military tech) use their batteries for lightweight, long-endurance applications like drones and satellites.
EV Potential: As EV makers look for lighter, longer-lasting batteries, Amprius could land deals with major automakers (Tesla? Lucid? Rivian?).
Consumer Electronics: Imagine longer battery life for smartphones, wearables, and laptops.

5. The Numbers Look Good
Revenue Growth: +55% in 2024, expected to jump another 53% in 2025.
Big Manufacturing Boost: New factory will help them scale production from 2 GWh in 2025 to 10 GWh by 2028.
Patents & Tech: Over 80 patents protect their breakthrough tech, keeping competitors like QuantumScape and Solid Power in the rearview.

6. Why It’s Undervalued
Compared to other battery companies, Amprius is flying under the radar. Their price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is around 12, while competitors like QuantumScape are at 16-18. This leaves room for big upside as more investors catch on to their growth story.

7. Risks (and Why They’re Manageable)
Supply Chain Issues: They’re locking in long-term deals for key materials like silicon.
Competition: Solid-state batteries are a threat, but Amprius is years ahead in real, working tech.
Scaling Challenges: New factories are expensive, but their track record shows they know how to deliver.

The Bottom Line
Amprius Technologies is the kind of small-cap stock with huge upside potential.

What is TMC? THE Mineral Company, Its a deep ocean mining company, Trump loves that stuff

Trumps indicated tariffs on China they for sure want to mine their own metals, even if it is underwater (very bad for environment) and the current administration is positive to deep sea mining, if there is money to be made they are gonna legalize it.

The mineral deposits they are working on are worth almost 60x of its current mcap alone with todays prices. Trade war and tariffs vs China, Russia etc might make this even higher

The boring stuff:

TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC) is a deep-sea minerals exploration firm focused on collecting, processing, and refining polymetallic nodules from the seafloor, primarily in the Clarion Clipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean. These nodules contain metals such as nickel, cobalt, copper, and manganese, which are essential for electric vehicle (EV) batteries and renewable energy storage solutions. Ring a bell?

Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has fluctuated between $0.721 and $2.070. The company has a market capitalization of approximately $372.52 million, with 341.76 million shares outstanding. TMC reported a net loss of $99.34 million over the trailing twelve months, resulting in an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.32. Currently, the company does not generate revenue.

Sadly i bought in after the recent 30% spike, but this thing is going even higher.

Price targets from ""professionals"":

Stock Analysis

Another source indicates a mean price target of $4.18.

Be aware that TMC operates in a nascent industry with inherent risks, including regulatory challenges, environmental Centerns, and the technical complexities of deep-sea mining. The company's financial performance has been characterized by net losses, and it currently lacks revenue generation. Potential investors should conduct thorough due diligence and consider these factors when evaluating the investment potential of TMC.

Insiders own 58.79% of the Stock and the latest price target came from Alliance global partners With a PT of 3.75,

Steve Jurvetson, renowned for his roles at SpaceX and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), was just added to their board. This is one of the big ones.

In late May 2024, The Metals Company announced a significant breakthrough — the first successful extraction of battery-grade nickel from deep-sea sources. Independent third-party evaluations confirmed that the nickel extracted from the Pacific Ocean could be processed into nickel sulfate, a crucial component in battery manufacturing.

Company forecasts indicate that their undersea resources could potentially supply the material needs of up to 280 million electric vehicles, which is equivalent to the current number of vehicles on U.S. roads. Analysts predict a break-even point by next year or 2026, positioning The Metals Company as a compelling near-term investment among penny stocks. Which is Incredible for a deep sea mining Stock.

This will be a lengthy one so hang on - but what's five minutes of reading for early retirement in a couple of years, eh?

**Ticker**: BEAMMW.B or BEAMMW\_B (Nasdaq First North growth market, apparently ticker varies a bit from broker to broker and you might need to activate certain features or markets with your broker to be able to trade)  
**Current Price**: 5,25 SEK / \~$0.50 USD  
**Market Cap**: \~$15.7M USD  
**Industry**: wireless communication

*The TL;DR*:

* They have a technology that literally everyone in the mobile industry and beyond will need to be able to compete in the higher radio frequencies
* Their solution is superior to anything out there today; faster, smaller and more energy efficient, at an affordable price point
* Competition to what they do is basically zero, with extremely high barriers of entry due to a literal minefield of patents that they own
* Their tech fits in smartphones, routers, base stations; you name it, it will fit
* They have the absolute dream team working on this
* Applications range from mobile, base stations, CPE, operators, satellite, self-driving cars, military, radar etc. the possibilities are endless as long as data needs to be transmitted wirelessly

This is a recipe for TSLA levels of success.

# Who are they?

BeammWave is a Swedish tech company developing and industrializing a technology called digital distributed beamforming, which makes wireless data transfer significantly faster and more efficient, and solves the looming issue of bandwidth running out on the frequencies in use today. It's the sorely missing key for the mobile industry to utilize higher radio frequencies at scale, something all the big players (think Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung etc.) are frothing at their mouths to get at.

Their key product is a compact (3x3mm) and affordable (1-2USD/chip) chip system with fully integrated antennas, enabling reliable wireless communication on the mmWave-spectrum without the bulk and subpar performance of the solutions in use today.

Last summer they became the world-first to showcase an over-the-air demo of digital distributed beamforming, and having protected their solution with over 40 patents so far they aim to own the entire market (think being able to own Bluetooth\* outright, imagine what that would be worth...)

\**ok, apples to oranges, since Bluetooth is a protocol and distributed digital beamforming is a technical solution, but the common factor is both represent a paradigm shift in the industry, something that everyone will need to adopt to be competitive*

# How are they pulling it off?

For being a small company in such a daunting industry they have some serious talent behind them – the team consists of telecom industry OG's, several of them having held key roles in developing bluetooth in the 90's and leading development of 5G at some of the biggest firms in the telecom industry, one of their engineers holding over 2000 patents to his name alone.

These guys garner a lot of respect in the industry and due to that they've had access to discuss their idea with all the big players for years already. As the CEO, Stefan Svedberg, himself says, everybody who's anybody in the industry knows who BeammWave are and what they are working on. Their personal merits have awarded them opportunities to work directly with chip manufacturers who normally don't do prototyping for small startups, and gain access to special tooling and materials usually reserved for the big guys. They also have a company member inside the organization for mobile broadband network standarization, 3GPP, with significant influence there, and they obviously aim to position digital distributed beamforming as the standard for mmWave operations in the future.

Simply put, BeammWave have positioned themselves as thought leaders when it comes to mmWave. The tech they own has sprung out of a decade of research at the University of Lund and what speaks to their clout is they have been able to attract global talent from the likes of Samsung, Huawei etc. to work for them instead.

The exciting bit is nobody's really caught onto them outside the industry. Yet.

# The geeky bits underpinning the value

Wireless communication is a MASSIVE market. The game has always been the same; to get faster speeds, more bandwdith and lower latency with less power consumption and at a cheaper price.

Data traffic's been increasing at breakneck speed through the adoption of smartphones, developments in computing, AI etc. to the point where current frequencies in use are simply running out of bandwidth. Moving to higher frequencies, what are called mmWave, is unavoidable in order to solve the data bandwidth problem.

The issue is once you go up in frequency, the reach and penetration of radio waves diminish significantly. Huge investments have been made into mmWave only for the tech to disappoint time after time, to a point where the whole field has gotten a bit of a bad rep. This is because the industry has been trying to solve it the wrong way.

The tech in use today is called analog beamforming; the hardware is bulky, expensive, slow at catching a signal, sensitive to spatial change, needs an unobstructed line of sight and simply doesn't work well. From the beginning the founders of BeammWave argued that analog beamforming was a stillborn idea – it simply would not work in real life. They argued the intelligent way to do beamforming was digital – and this is something everyone would agree on, but, the retort was, it wouldn't be cheap enough. It wouldn't be energy efficient enough. It might just be impossible, full stop.

Well, turns out it wasn't. And nobody else was ”crazy” enough to go for it.

# Where are they at today?

Since 2023/4 BeammWave has been out of their research and development phase and are now selling their development platform called ADP1, and are working with customers on projects that aim for production. According to the CEO they're on track to have a fully commercial product ready this year, with production of scale ramping up in 2026.

Currently, four major companies are working with them and evaluating their product;

1. Molex, which is the second largest electronic connector company in the world,
2. Alpha Networks, with whom they are working on a fixed wireless access solution together,
3. SAAB, with whom they are working on innovations with military-civilian synergies, and
4. an as of yet undisclosed customer, who has revealed they're an Asian component manufacturer and industry leader in mmWave, with over 70 000 employees and 10+ billion USD in revenue. All the hints point toward muRata Manufacturing. In the event the rumors are correct, I can't stress how huge that would be. It could imply that both Apple and Samsung are nibbling on BeammWave's solution already, since muRata supplies them both.

Keep in mind BeammWave are the only ones in the world with this kind of tech - something everyone in the industry needs to be able to compete in the mmWave frequencies. And they've protected their solution with over 40 patents so far, and more incoming. It will be extremely difficult, bordering impossible for anyone to bypass their intellectual property with a distributed digital beamforming solution, no matter who you are.

# So what about the MONEY??

In interviews the CEO, Stefan Svedberg, has repeatedly been asked to tease some numbers on how their revenues will scale, but understandably he's been quite vague. His exact words from a few months back were that the numbers get pretty ridiculous pretty fast if you start to do math...

But, since I'm not the CEO, let me pull some numbers outta my ass anyway.

Current stock price is sitting around 0,50USD with a mkt cap of around 13,7 million at a 30 million share float. Say BeammWave chips get into 20% of the smartphones before 2030, around 300 million units per year. The estimate is they'll need 6-10 chips per unit at 1-2USD/chip, that's 6-20USD per device. Revenue would be totalling 1,8 – 6 billion USD a year.

Let's lowball a P/E of 5. That would mean a market cap of 9 – 30 billion USD, in other words 300 – 1000 USD/share at the current float. PWOAH! Yeah, that went apeshit pretty fast..! And that's only the mobile market. I won't pull any more numbers outta my ass, but to me this is looking like one of the plays of the decade.

Why is the current valuation so low? Well, personally I think they'd already be due for a 10x with what they have so far, but they are a very tech-oriented company and what they do is very, very complex. I don't think a lot of people understand the scope of their business case and they haven't been shouting about themselves from the rooftops either. There's no sexy one-paragraph way of explaining the proposition. On top of that, they're trading on the rather obscure Nasdaq First North growth market, and not many eyes have been on them so far. But once their stuff starts going to mass production – oh boy.

**Disclaimer**: Not financial advice and am no expert on this whatsoever – just trying to provide something of value for you guys instead of repeating the same pre-mooned tickers that are on the front page over and over. Do your own DD, but if this thing hits, don’t forget the little guy when you’re sipping cocktails on a beach somewhere.

2025-01-09,04:35:14,pennystocks,ARBE Robotics: Cheap Radar Chips to Replace LiDAR?,"DD on going LONG on ARBE 

Alright, hear me out. Arbe's 4D imaging radar tech could straight-up replace LiDAR, or at least work alongside it. Why?

Weather-Proof AF: LiDAR struggles in rain/snow, but Arbe’s radar doesn't flinch.

Longer Range: Great for big rigs and fleets.

Cheaper and Stronger: LiDAR’s overpriced and fragile—this radar tech is built for the grind.

Not Perfect: Sure, it doesn’t have LiDAR’s resolution in ideal conditions, but in the real world (you know, where it rains), this wins.


Now, imagine fleets of commercial trucks or robotaxis running on this stuff. Tesla hates LiDAR and won’t touch it, this tech fits right into their ""cheaper, faster, better"" vibe. Feels like Arbe could land some juicy partnerships down the line.

About That NVIDIA Collab:
Did some digging. Arbe says they’re working with NVIDIA on their DRIVE platform. Jensen didn’t name-drop them at CES, but he did mention partnerships focused on AI for autonomous vehicles. Could be legit, could be Arbe trying to flex. Either way, it's on the radar (pun intended).

The cons: 

Let’s be real, Arbe’s revenue is barely scraping six figures ($123k last quarter), and they’re burning cash faster than a YOLO options trade. Manufacturing is still in baby steps, and if they can’t scale up, someone else will eat their lunch. Plus, negative gross profit? C’mon, at least pretend to make money.


My Play:
In for 2,000 shares at $4.47. Waiting for news that Arbe’s cranking out chips and landing deals. If this tech takes off, it’s game over for LiDAR in fleets.

Not financial advice, just a guy speculating on radar tech. Let’s see if this one flies.

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, December 19, 2024- Realbotix Corp. (TSX-V: XBOT)
(Frankfurt Stock Exchange: 76M0.F) (OTC: XBOTF) (“Realbotix” or the
“Company”), a leading creator of humanoid robots and companionship-based
AI, is pleased to share its 2025 business outlook, underscoring confidence in
its companionship product advancements, AI development initiatives and
cryptocurrency holdings.
“2024 had many changes including an expansion into AI and robotics, a name
change, and a rebrand,
” said Andrew Kiguel, CEO.
“We’re pleased to see our
crypto strategy paying off and are confident that our ventures in AI and
robotics will provide for meaningful shareholder value in 2025.
”
2025 Capital Markets Initiatives
Realbotix remains well capitalized and management does not foresee the
need to raise capital in 2025.
In addition, management does not feel the current share price fully reflects
the value of its business. As a result, Realbotix will allocate a portion of its
capital in Q1 to its Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) announced in October to
buy back its common shares if they remain at current levels. At the current
common share prices, the Company's cash and cash equivalents represents
over 50% of its market capitalization.
Realbotix has a September financial year-end and is currently finalizing its
audited financial statements for 2024. It is anticipated that the Company will
release its audited statements approximately in the third week of January and
within regulatory timelines.
Cryptocurrency Treasury Strategy
Realbotix remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency market. While the
company continues to stake approximately 60% of its owned ETH, the other
approximately 40% of its ETH holdings are unstaked to allow for opportunistic
selling in anticipation of a further bullish pricing environment. In December,
Realbotix sold 100 ETH for working capital purposes.
The Company’s remaining crypto holdings have appreciated by 173% since
our previous fiscal year ended October 1st, 2023. Realbotix may explore
additional purchases or sales of cryptocurrency. The company currently holds
approximately 2880 ETH, alongside other digital assets, and is owed
approximately 10,333 SOL and 84 ETH from Genesis. Genesis has
communicated to the Company that further distributions will occur before
the end of 2024. Management is confident it will recover the majority of the
remaining assets from Genesis.
The current value of Realbotix’s self-custodied cryptocurrency and holdings
those held at Genesis, have a gross value of approximately US$ 13.77M (US$
2.5M held at Genesis) or CDN$ 19.73M(CDN$ 3.6M held at Genesis). As
disclosed previously, Genesis Global Trading is undergoing a restructuring. As
a result, some of those holdings may not be recovered. We note these figures
do not include Realbotix’s cash holdings. At current market values, this
represents over 50% of the Company's market capitalization.
2025 Robotic and AI Marketing Initiatives
With the launch of the new consumer website, Realbotix.com, the company
enters 2025 with a focus on sales and marketing strategy. Plans include hiring
sales people and scaling operations to meet demand. Realbotix has been the
beneficiary of significant positive media coverage in 2024 and anticipates this
momentum to grow as its robot lineup expands in the coming year.
The AI and robotics market is on a significant upward trajectory. Elon Musk
recently estimated that humanoid robots could become a multi-trillion-dollar
industry1
, further validating Realbotix’s innovative product strategy and
growth potential.

“Our goal is to become a significant player in the humanoid robotics market.
Although the market and our products are at early stages, our robots are
available now for purchase,
” said Andrew Kiguel, CEO of Realbotix.
“Our next
iteration of companionship and social AI is nearing completion. We believe
our products have numerous use cases, including tackling the loneliness
epidemic which is estimated to impact as high as 50% of US citizens2
. As one
of the only providers of robotic hardware and AI software that integrates to
address this area of healthcare, management feels confident in our ability to
successfully grow.
”
Realbotix continues to distinguish itself from other AI companies by offering
deeply integrated hardware and software solutions that focus on human-like
connection, creating what management believes to be the most realistic
AI-powered robots on the market.
Management intends to make further investments into marketing and sales
with the goal of increasing its revenue pipeline. This would take the form of
hiring additional sales support personnel and investing in further marketing
such as attending trade shows and other forms of advertising.
2025 AI and Hardware Development
The development of Realbotix’s next-generation companionship AI remains a
core focus, with key partnerships driving progress. Supported by Compass
and a grant from Amazon Web Services, the company is advancing its unique
emotional AI platform, which prioritizes unfiltered, emotionally driven
conversations over traditional task-based AI models.
Additionally, the Robot Controller 3.0, currently under development,
represents a large upgrade in the functionality and AI of Realbotix’s
humanoid robotics. With improved motors, speech capabilities, it delivers
high levels of fluidity and realism in movement. In addition, it leverages our
proprietary AI technologies to bring smarter, more intuitive interactions to life,
setting new standards in robotic innovation.

Domain Name Sales
Management plans to be more assertive in 2025 with respect to selling
certain domain names, including Tokens.com. The Tokens.com landing page
has been converted to a sales site with that domain listed at US$6 million.
Management notes, the domain is not valued on its balance sheet and any
sales would be incremental to the balance sheet asset values.
Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025
Realbotix is excited to showcase its cutting-edge products at the Consumer
Electronics Show (CES) being held January 7th-10th, 2025. Realbotix will be

2. Key Financial & Operational Highlights

1. Revenue Growth:

They’ve historically delivered solid revenue growth, boosted by acquisitions. However, recent macro headwinds have tempered AdTech’s growth across the industry.

Keep an eye on how organic growth compares to acquisition-driven growth.



2. Margins & Profitability:

Gross margins can vary depending on the revenue mix (on-device solutions vs. programmatic ads). Acquisitions introduced integration costs, but management aims to streamline operations.



3. Balance Sheet & Debt:

Acquisitions have increased leverage. The company has pledged to focus on managing debt and improving cash flow.

Free cash flow is essential; watch for any improvement in operational efficiencies post-integration.



4. Recent Guidance:

Management comments on the digital advertising environment can be telling. They often cite broad economic factors (like recession fears) that might influence ad spend.





---

3. Competitive Landscape

AppLovin (APP): Also focuses on mobile user acquisition and monetization, heavily in the mobile gaming sector.

ironSource (acquired by Unity): Offers monetization and analytics tools, especially for gaming apps.

Large Tech Players: Google and Meta dominate digital ads, though Digital Turbine’s on-device distribution angle sets it apart.


The AdTech space is crowded and highly competitive. Digital Turbine’s differentiator is its “pre-loaded” approach and relationships with carriers/OEMs that not every competitor can easily replicate.


---

4. Potential Upsides & Bullish Points

Integration of Acquired Platforms: If they can blend AdColony, Fyber, and Appreciate into a cohesive, well-oiled advertising machine, cross-selling could significantly boost revenue.

Growing Mobile Market: Smartphone usage and app installs keep rising, so targeted mobile advertising remains attractive.

Global Expansion: Partnerships with international carriers and emerging market OEMs could open up new revenue streams.



---

5. Main Risks & Bearish Considerations

1. Integration Risks: Combining multiple acquisitions is challenging. If synergy goals aren’t met, margins and growth could disappoint.


2. Advertising Spend Cyclicality: During economic slowdowns, ad budgets are often the first to get cut. That can hurt growth and stock performance.


3. Competitive Pressure: Big fish like Google can rapidly introduce competing solutions or restrict data access (see Apple’s ATT changes for iOS).


4. Regulation & Privacy: Ongoing shifts in data privacy (think GDPR, CCPA, potential new rules) can reduce the effectiveness of targeted advertising.




---

6. Valuation Metrics to Watch

Price-to-Sales (P/S): Common for high-growth tech stocks. Compare APPS to other AdTech names (AppLovin, The Trade Desk, etc.).

EV/EBITDA: A measure of operational efficiency. Useful if the company is EBITDA-positive.

Free Cash Flow (FCF): Indicates how well the business can fund growth and reduce debt.

Revenue Guidance vs. Actuals: AdTech names can be volatile around earnings. Keep a close eye on how actual growth stacks up against management’s forecast.



---

7. Final Thoughts

Digital Turbine is a unique play in the AdTech ecosystem due to its on-device presence and broad approach to mobile monetization. The stock had a big run-up in past years, then pulled back amid overall AdTech volatility and macro concerns. Now, it’s in a period of potential consolidation and integration, which could set the stage for a next leg of growth if execution is strong.

DYOR and consider your own risk tolerance. AdTech can be a boom-or-bust sector, heavily reliant on macroeconomic factors and consumer behavior. I’m personally watching how the acquisitions pan out and whether management can smoothly integrate them to unlock meaningful synergies.

What do you think? Share your thoughts in the comments. Are you bullish, bearish, or on the fence with Digital Turbine? Any insights on the AdTech landscape or personal experiences with their platform?

2025-01-06,05:15:15,pennystocks,WOLF: Oversold Chipmaker Ready to Explode Due to Massive Capacity Increase,"WOLF is uniquely positioned as a global leader in silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) technologies, which are critical for high-performance, energy-efficient power and RF solutions. The company’s strategic focus on markets undergoing rapid electrification including EVs, renewable energy, and industrial applications positions it to capitalize on secular growth trends. With a robust pipeline of customer contracts, significant capacity expansion plans, and strong R&D capabilities, Wolfspeed is set to deliver sustained revenue and margin growth over the long term.

Key Catalysts for Growth
1. Leadership in Silicon Carbide Technology: Wolfspeed has established itself as a pioneer in SiC semiconductor manufacturing, an essential material for high-efficiency power applications. SiC adoption is expected to accelerate as industries prioritize energy efficiency and performance, giving Wolfspeed a durable competitive advantage.
2. Electric Vehicle Market Expansion: The global EV market is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 20% through 2030. Wolfspeed’s SiC components enable higher efficiency and range in EVs, making the company a key supplier to leading automakers. Recent multi-year supply agreements with major EV manufacturers, including Tesla, underscore its pivotal role in this ecosystem.
3. Mohawk Valley Fab Ramp-Up: The Mohawk Valley Fab, Wolfspeed’s state-of-the-art SiC facility, has begun operations and is expected to increase production capacity significantly. This will support the company’s ability to meet surging demand and scale revenues.
4. Secular Trends in Renewable Energy: As the world transitions to renewable energy sources, SiC’s superior efficiency makes it indispensable for applications in solar inverters, wind turbines, and energy storage systems. Wolfspeed’s solutions align perfectly with these trends, opening new avenues for growth.
5. R&D and Technological Innovation: Wolfspeed’s continued investment in R&D ensures that it remains at the forefront of innovation, enabling the development of next-generation SiC and GaN solutions that will drive future growth.
6. Potential for a Short Squeeze: Wolfspeed has very high short interest, currently at 30.14% of its float. If positive developments, such as stronger-than-expected earnings or favorable industry news, were to materialize, it could trigger a short squeeze. Investors should consider this dynamic as a potential accelerant to Wolfspeed’s already strong growth narrative. 
7. Primed for a Rebound: Wolfspeed’s stock has been under significant pressure in recent months, with its valuation beaten down due to macroeconomic concerns and temporary operational challenges. However, the company’s underlying fundamentals remain strong, and any positive news such as improved earnings, increased EV adoption, or successful capacity ramp-ups could serve as a catalyst for a sharp rebound. Given its leadership position and strategic importance in high-growth markets, the stock is primed to take off as sentiment shifts positively.

Financial Overview
Revenue Growth: Wolfspeed delivered revenue growth of 36% year-over-year in the most recent quarter, driven by strong demand across EV and industrial markets.

Gross Margins: While current gross margins are under pressure due to capacity expansion costs, I expect margins to improve as the Mohawk Valley Fab reaches optimal utilization.

Long-Term Contracts: Wolfspeed’s $3 billion+ order backlog provides clear visibility into future revenue streams.

Balance Sheet Strength: The company maintains a solid cash position, enabling it to fund expansion and innovation initiatives. It was also the recipient of $750MM from the CHIPS Act.

Valuation
My price target of $14.72 is based on a forward P/S multiple of 2.3x (WOLF is currently 1.12x), reflecting Wolfspeed’s premium positioning in high-growth markets and robust earnings potential.",TSLA,Tesla

2025-01-04,10:59:46,pennystocks,Why RVSN is THE investment.,"I do not understand why people ask for a price target. Point prediction is just stupid because no one knows where the price will be in a certain time. Price fluctuations are natural for small cap stocks, especially if assaulted by big investors that can easily move the price up/down, so don't be scared of losses and don't get too excited for gains. This company has potential to grow, and I am not the only one believing in this. Let's talk about numbers:

* **Revenue Growth**: +436% y-o-y (from **$142K in 2023** to **$761K in 2024**).
* **Liquidity**: Current ratio (total assets/total liabilities) improved to **4.86** in 2024 from 3.27 in 2023, showing they have the cash to fund growth without immediate risks.
* **Scaling Phase**: Net losses grew by **316%** (from **$5.84M in 2023** to **$24.32M in 2024**), tied to R&D and scaling, i.e. typical sign of a company transitioning to higher revenue tiers (this happened to TSLA, PLTR).

Not to mention how their products can be disruptive.  
RVSN is developing **AI-powered railway safety systems** that have the potential to **revolutionize rail transportation**:

1. **Safety First**: Their technology detects obstacles on railway tracks in real-time, even in low-visibility conditions. This could dramatically reduce accidents, saving lives and preventing costly disruptions.
2. **Global Adoption Potential**: Rail safety is a **$100B+ global market**, with increasing investments in automation and AI-driven solutions. RVSN’s technology fits perfectly into this growing trend.
3. **Market Expansion Opportunities**: Beyond railways, this tech could expand into metro systems, industrial automation, or even other safety-critical industries, opening doors to multiple revenue streams.

  
*I can reference every single number.*

Be also aware that the company almost achieved Nasdaq compliance. This will let institutional investors gaining even more confidence...

It doesn’t really matter if it was caused by fireworks in the trunk or something else—Elon will likely address it somehow. There’s a good chance his response will include a statement emphasizing Tesla’s commitment to battery safety, the fact that their batteries are reliable, and even ongoing efforts to improve safety further. My first thought? KULR. Even if Elon stays silent, the market might still make the connection: TSLA  safety = batteries  + KULR.

These are just my loose thoughts—I’m not claiming this will definitely happen, nor that KULR would be the only beneficiary of such a scenario. The market often reacts emotionally and speculatively, and everyone should assess for themselves whether they see an opportunity here.

2025-01-01,18:34:44,pennystocks,Airspace Batteries ($ABTT) is positioning itself to be the next $KULR 🚀,"**Not financial advice. Do your own due diligence before you invest.**



Congrats to everyone who saw gains from $ABTT on Tuesday. Considering it was a down day for most other stocks, I’ll happily take a 24% gain. However Airspace Batteries ($ABTT) is likely due for at least one more surge in January. With high earnings per share, cutting edge tech and large institutional buy in, there is a chance this could be the next $KULR.

 

* **Market Cap - $98.2mil**
* **Current Price - $2.54**
* **52-Week Range - $0.81–2.67**

**1. Recent Developments**

* Has developed a new patented lithium ion battery (Named *Cheetah)* in 2023 which can store charge 12% better than its competitors. It’s now out the research and development phase and the company is now **laser focused on securing contracts**, with several buyers interested.
* **Reported net profit of $0.4 EPS** in their latest earnings report, which is mind-boggling, considering they’ve been focused on developing their products. Analysts expect this to soar in 2025 and 2026.
* Partnerships and Acquisitions: Interest from the military with a rumoured partnership with a well known carmaker.

**2. History and Product**

* Quite a new company as it was founded in 2019 by MIT alumni Jordan Hughes, a serial entrepreneur who founded Pop Rocketr before its acquisition for $1.6mil. Hughes was unhappy with the state of electric car batteries and wanted to **turbocharge progress so the next generation of batteries could be launched today.**
* Inspired by his wife’s pent up rage towards his business ventures, Hughes wanted the battery to store an additional 86% charge than Tesla and Duracell batteries. So far results are positive, with a single Cheetah outlasting the latter by over 370%. The implications of this are massive, as you could charge your phone in twice the speed as a conventional charger. Hughes is hoping to shrink the Cheetah by 10X so it can eventually stand comfortably on your desk.
* $ABTT raised a staggering $30mil last year when Hughes approached a renown loan shark for capital in exchange for repayment. Sadly, not realising the loan shark was connected to the mob (Who have charged bespoke interest fees just for him), Hughes has struggled to repay on time due to the **cutting edge research and development** costs that come with building a battery. This has resulted in Hughes losing his two best typing figures, with analysts predicting double digit losses by 2027 if capital is not repaid. However Hughes remains optimistic that he can repay, once his Bitcoin treasury pays dividends (See below).
* However their main market is electric vehicles. The results are coming in and **$ABTT batteries are outperforming their competitors by a country mile**: One study has found that when fitted in an electric car of your choice, the **Cheetah battery can outlast the car’s lifespan by over 10 years**. Critics have argued this is due to the battery shorting the car’s circuits, rendering it unusable. However Hughes has since successfully made the case in court that you should diversify your car holdings to allow for combustible-fuel engines as well.

 

**3. Detailed Financial Analysis and developments**

* Where most companies often struggle turning a profit until their research and development stage is over, **$ABTT has already started to turn profitable**, bringing in a whopping $0.4 per share in earnings. There are **currently no plans for dilution** in the next 6-12 days and **analysts are positive** that the EPS could even rise to $0.41 next quarter.
* Airspace Batteries shocked the investing world when they announced a **bold plan** to create a massive Bitcoin treasury this financial quarter, using net cash. Investors have been cautiously optimistic as the company has already allocated funds for a whopping 685,485 Satoshis. Their crypto broker has confirmed this is the maximum amount of Bitcoin you can buy per financial year, and Hughes has stated that this justifies spending 68% of their net cash on cryptocurrency and fees. There are already plans next financial quarter to buy the rest of the bitcoin. Institutional investors are now observing whether this bold move will bring big returns, but considering the success of other companies with Bitcoin treasuries, I think this can only mean good things.
* Net revenue for the last financial year was $23mil, a **90% increase on the financial year before**.

 

**4. Growth Drivers for next 5 years.**

* a. The demand for lithium ion batteries is expanding by 18% per year, with **no signs of stopping**. Futurologists are already predicting the end of combustible engine batteries, which means there will be a market void to fill.  $ABTT is well positioned to get a big slice of that pie.
* b. With current price indicators remaining bullish on crypto over the next 5 years, analysts are confident that the newly established Bitcoin treasury will **likely boost revenues** by an eye watering $3.6.
* The C.E.O, Jordan Hughes has a great record for promoting his company online, and shows no sign of stopping. This has increased visibility in the company by 600% since August last year. He has also made numerous media appearances whilst giving out flyers on Wall Street. This will likely pay dividends in the company’s future.

 

**5. Potential Risks**

* Airspace Batteries is a relatively new company, so will have difficulty jostling for a bigger slice of the market, compared to its competitors.
* Hughes is a notorious gambler, often taking his company’s revenue to Vegas each financial quarter and betting it all on the roulette table. This has been a risky strategy, but has **paid off** at least 2/6 times so far. However Hughes is looking to pivot his high risk, high reward strategy towards poker. Could more gains be on the horizon?
* Activist investors are unsure about whether to invest money in a company where the mob has a 48% stake in it. However **analysts are predicting that with such big institutional buy in that this should ensure stability towards the company’s success.**
* It's always worth doing due diligence with a company of this type.



  


In summary, $ABTT is a high risk, high reward play that could pay big in 2025. As the company is out of its research and development phase, with huge institutional buy in, Airspace Batteries can now focus on acquiring customers and finally take on big battery.  With investors already looking for the next $KULR, I hope you make money!

2024-12-31,09:21:14,pennystocks,Why I am optimistic about TANH,"Tantech Holdings Ltd. (TANH), listed on NASDAQ, produces activated carbon-based products and eco-friendly technologies, including electric vehicles (EVs). Here’s a quick breakdown of why it might be worth your investment (or at least your attention while waiting for your next moonshot):

Why Invest in Tantech?
	
1. Diverse and sustainable products:
	Tantech makes products used for water filtration, air purification, and more. A company that’s cleaning water and air? Maybe it’ll clean up in the market too.
	
2. Growing presence in the EV market:
	They’re focusing on electric commercial vehicles like buses and transport trucks. Not exactly Tesla, but hey, who doesn’t love a good underdog story?
	
3. Rising demand for green tech:
	The world wants sustainability, and Tantech is in the right place at the right time. Governments love funding green projects, so why not hitch a ride on their budget?
	
4. Access to China’s market:
	China’s massive EV and green tech market is Tantech’s home turf. When your playground is the biggest EV market in the world, you’ve got at least some room to grow.
	
5. Affordable stock price:
	It’s cheap. Like “I’ll throw in $50 and see what happens” cheap. Remember: no risk, no reward—just don’t bet your lunch money.
	
6. Potential for global expansion:
	If Tantech starts expanding internationally, it could turn some heads. Think of it like a penny stock going abroad for the first time—kind of like that cousin who just discovered backpacking.

Tantech might not be the next big thing, but it could surprise you if it capitalizes on the EV and green tech trends. Just remember, it’s a penny stock—so play it smart.

2024-12-30,21:44:19,pennystocks,ASNS Ready For 🚀,"(NASDAQ: ASNS)

I’m in on this one because I think they’re about to pop. They’re making moves in cybersecurity and defence, and with Litchfield Hills putting a $5 price target on them, I feel like this is one to watch. They’re up today with over 2 million shares traded, with support around $1.30. Could be gearing up for a breakout. Here’s my quick take:


1. MetaShield Looks Solid

They just launched MetaShield, an AI-powered cybersecurity product. Yeah, it’s a buzzword, but the SaaS angle means recurring revenue if they get it right. Could be huge.


2. Defence Deals Are Rolling

They’ve got contracts with U.S. military bases, and their tech is on the DoDIN list (basically the DoD’s trusted tech club). That’s legit, and it feels like more deals are coming.

3. Trump Factor

Trump’s focus on boosting military budgets (https://br.advfn.com/bolsa-de-valores/nasdaq/ASNS/share-news/94945275/geo-political-tensions-and-trumps-increasing-military-budgets-could-boost-demand) could be a tailwind here. Their tech is fast, cost-effective, and exactly what’s needed for modernising defence infrastructure.

This just feels like the right time for Actelis. They’ve got innovative tech, real contracts, and some serious upside potential.

The science: Silicon is good at storing Lithium ions, one Silicon atom can store 4 Lithium ions, and 24 times more efficient than graphite anodes in use today, so it can be more energy dense and light weight compared to existing batteries (I wonder who would like that).  The main issues its that the silicon anode will expand a lot.

Lithium isn't just for EV batteries—although that's a massive part of its demand. Here’s what lithium is used for:

Electric Vehicles (EVs): Powers Tesla, Rivian, and other EVs. Every EV battery needs lithium.

Consumer Electronics: Think smartphones, laptops, and even gaming consoles.

Energy Storage: Lithium-ion batteries are essential for renewable energy storage (solar and wind).

Aerospace: Lightweight lithium batteries for planes and satellites.

Medical Uses: Lithium is used in pharmaceuticals (bipolar disorder) and medical devices (like pacemakers).

Industrial Applications: Lubricants, ceramics, glass, and even nuclear fusion research.


Demand for lithium is expected to grow 25% annually through 2030 as we move toward a greener future. That’s where LAC comes in.

This is the largest known lithium deposit in the U.S., and it’s expected to produce 40,000 metric tons/year of lithium carbonate in Phase 1, with potential for expansion.

LAC recently finalized a joint venture with General Motors (GM) in December 2024. GM invested $625 million and now holds a 38% stake, ensuring funding and a steady buyer for the lithium.

Source: Reuters, Dec 23, 2024



2. DOE Loan Approval:

The U.S. Department of Energy granted LAC a $2.26 billion loan in October 2024 to fund Thacker Pass. This shows strong government support for domestic lithium production.

Source: Reuters, Oct 28, 2024



3. Market Outlook:

Lithium demand is skyrocketing due to EVs and renewable energy storage. Thacker Pass could be a game-changer for the U.S., reducing reliance on foreign lithium from countries like China and Australia.

The Numbers

Stock Price (as of Dec 28, 2024): $3.09

Market Cap: ~$1.5 billion

Analyst Ratings: Average 12-month price target of $5.06, implying 60% upside.

What’s the Catch? (Risks)

1. Environmental and Legal Challenges:

Thacker Pass has faced lawsuits from environmental groups and local tribes. These legal battles could delay production and increase costs.

Source: BBC News, Oct 2024



2. Market Volatility:

Lithium prices have been unpredictable. If prices dip, it could hurt profitability.



3. Dilution Risk:

LAC is still in its development phase and isn’t profitable yet. It might need to issue more shares to raise capital, diluting current shareholders.



4. Competition:

Other players in the lithium space, like Albemarle and Piedmont Lithium, could overshadow LAC if they scale production faster.





---

Why It’s Worth Watching

If you believe in the future of EVs, renewable energy, and tech, lithium is the oil of the 21st century. LAC’s Thacker Pass project puts it in a unique position to dominate the U.S. lithium supply chain, especially with government backing and a GM partnership.


---

TL;DR

Bull Case: Largest U.S. lithium deposit, GM partnership, DOE loan, and skyrocketing demand for lithium.

Bear Case: Environmental/legal challenges, volatile lithium prices, and potential dilution.


It’s high risk, but the upside could be huge. Do your own research and only invest what you can afford to lose. What’s your take on LAC? 🚀 or 🐻?

**Blockmate Ventures Inc. $MATE.V $MATEF**

Market Cap: $13M

Company Overview:

Blockmate is a blockchain-focused company with its main asset being Hivello. Hivello is a decentralized platform where users can share their computing resources for things like AI modelling, storage, and VPN services. In return, they get paid in tokens. Blockmate owns more than 50% of Hivello and is targeting growth in regions like Africa and Asia, where this kind of income could really take off.



**Highlights**

Right now, the big story with Blockmate is Hivello. The platform makes it easy for people to earn passive income, anywhere from $20 to $300 a month, by running nodes. For users in developing countries, this extra money could go a long way, and the potential to scale quickly in these markets is a huge opportunity.

Hivello recently raised $3.5M at a $30M USD valuation. Blockmate’s stake alone is worth over $0.20 CAD per share, which is double the stock’s current price (only around $0.11). Once the financing closes, it could bring even more attention to the company.

The Hivello token launch, planned for Q1 2025, is another big catalyst. If the token takes off, it could create a cycle where more users join, the token value rises, and the platform gains even more traction. Early beta testing has been looking promising, and the company plans to grow the user base quickly with partnerships and rental programs for people who don’t already own equipment.

Financially, Blockmate is in a good spot. Recent warrant exercises added to their cash reserves, and the company is keeping its operations lean. Domenic Carosa, the president, owns 20M shares, so he’s clearly invested in the company’s success.

I just like this play because obviously crypto is hot right now, and of all the different narratives and use cases for blockchain tech, DePin is one of the most promising IMO.  


**Zoomd Technologies Ltd. $ZMDTF $ZOMD.V**

Market Cap: 74M (up 100% since first post)

Company Overview

Zoomd operates in the digital ad tech space, specializing in mobile-focused, KPI-driven advertising solutions. Their tech helps brands navigate advertising channels outside major platforms like Google and Meta, providing a unified service for customer acquisition across various media types. Zoomd’s platform allows clients to efficiently manage and optimize ad campaigns on multiple channels, from social media to programmatic ad networks, all while maintaining clear, KPI-based results.

**Highlights**

Two weeks ago, Zoomd posted strong results in Q3 2024, with $16.7M in revenue, up 135% from last year. For the first nine months of 2024, they brought in $39.4M, which is a 60% increase compared to the same period last year. This growth comes from focusing on their high-performing core services and cutting out underperforming products.

What’s impressive is that this strategy hasn’t just boosted revenue but it also has made the company more profitable. They recorded $3.2M in net income for Q3, marking six consecutive quarters of profitability. Adjusted ebitda climbed to $3.9M, a big jump from $0.6M in Q3 last year. They’ve also tightened up their expenses, with operating costs now at 20% of revenue, compared to 41% a year ago.

Zoomd’s strength lies in helping brands grow on a global scale. Their platform supports multiple ad formats across different regions and devices, making it easier for clients to scale campaigns internationally. Their client retention is solid, with top customers staying with them for over three years on average, which is no small feat in such a competitive market.

Financially, they are in a strong position with $6.8M in cash and steady cash flow from operations. They’re looking to invest in future growth, and their focus on core strengths and a diversified client base gives them stability, even in a challenging market.

I just like how the management is running this company and I think it has a lot more room to grow. That’s why I’ve been talking about this company for the past few months lol.  


**Simply Better Brands Corp. $SBBC.V $SBBCF**

Market Cap: $119M (Up 65% since first post)

Company Overview

Simply Better Brands is an international omni-channel platform focused on plant-based, natural, and clean ingredient consumer products. Their portfolio includes brands like TRUBAR, a fast-growing protein snack line, and other assets targeting health-conscious Millennials and Gen Z.

**Highlights**

SBBC has had a strong year, with much of their growth coming from the success of their TRUBAR brand. In Q3 2024, they reported $12.1M in revenue, a 124% increase from last year, with TRUBAR™ sales growing 156%. For the first nine months of 2024, total revenue reached $32.6M, up 30% compared to 2023.

TRUBAR has expanded into over 15,000 stores across North America, including Walmart, Whole Foods, CVS, and GNC. They’ve also added new distribution deals with Albertsons, Love’s Travel Stops, and Walmart Canada, further expanding their retail presence. On the DTC side, online sales through platforms like Amazon grew by 253% this quarter, showing strong traction in e-commerce.

Financially, SBBC is in a much better position. Gross margins hit 45% in Q3, driven by lower production costs and higher sales volumes. Adjusted ebitda reached $1M, up 376% from last year, reflecting improved operational efficiency. They’ve also cleaned up their balance sheet, converting all convertible debt to equity and ending the quarter with $2.9M in positive working capital, impressive when compared to a $12.4M deficit at the end of 2023.

Looking ahead, SBBC expects TRUBAR to bring in $45M-$50M in revenue for 2024. They’re focusing on product innovation with new flavours, smaller pack sizes, and tailored offerings for retailers, which should help them capture more of the $6B global snack bar market.

SBBC’s strategy of scaling TRUBAR™ while keeping operations lean shows they’re building for sustainable growth. With clean-label, plant-based snacks gaining popularity, they’re well-positioned to keep growing in a competitive market.

They are just killing it tbh, been long on SBBC for a while.

2024-12-11,23:04:53,pennystocks,🚀 [DD] ONDS: The Drone Play for the MAGA Defense Boom! 🌩️,"Alright degenerates, listen up! I’ve found the stock that might just be the most *Murica* thing since bald eagles on Monster Energy cans. Ondas Holdings Inc. ($ONDS) is here to ride the wave of border walls, drones, and some AI wizardry. With Trump back in office and an inevitable boost in defense spending, ONDS could be the sleeper pick of the year. Let’s break it down in terms even your ape brains can understand.

# What’s the play?

ONDS isn’t your basic drone company. It’s got *four* killer verticals that make it the ultimate bet on MAGA-era defense, infrastructure, and tech spending:

# 1. Autonomous Drones 🛩️

* **Products**:
   * **Optimus Systems**: These drones basically never sleep. They’re like your ex, but useful—doing 24/7 surveillance for infrastructure, border patrol, and even Dubai Police.
   * **Scout System**: A drone-in-a-box setup for industrial monitoring. Think of it as Big Brother for factories.
* **Why this matters now**: Trump loves big, beautiful walls and surveillance tech to guard the homeland. ONDS’ drones can patrol borders autonomously. Imagine a giant drone wall that never stops.

# 2. Mission-Critical Networks 📡

* **Products**:
   * A fancy 900 MHz network made for railroads, utilities, and public safety. It's not just Wi-Fi—it’s industrial-grade, super-secure, and built to last.
   * Deployed with Metra (Chicago trains) and big rail players like Union Pacific. If the train system gets upgraded (and it’s about time), ONDS wins.
* **Why this matters now**: The Trump admin is all about “America First,” and that means beefing up critical infrastructure. Think railroads, power grids, and public safety networks. ONDS has the goods to cash in on this spending spree.

# 3. Counter-Drone Solutions 🛡️

* **Products**:
   * **Iron Drone Raider**: This bad boy literally catches rogue drones. It's like Pokémon Go for Homeland Security.
* **Why this matters now**: Increased focus on securing airspace. Airports, military bases, and critical infrastructure don’t need Karen’s Amazon drone snooping around. The Pentagon might be writing Ondas a fat check soon.

# 4. Artificial Intelligence 🤖

* **Products**:
   * AI to make all the above smarter. Think autonomous decision-making for drones and optimizing mission-critical networks.
* **Why this matters now**: Uncle Sam loves AI. Ondas’ AI-enhanced tech fits perfectly into defense strategies for smarter surveillance and threat detection.

# Show me the tendies!

ONDS is still in its early innings but let’s look at the numbers.

* **Q3 Revenue**: $1.48M. It’s not Tesla numbers, but they’ve got contracts rolling in from railroads and homeland security deals. They won $14.4M of contracts in Q3, $9M of which was for the Iron Drone.
* **Cash Update**: After a convertible noteholder pumped in $4M recently, ONDS has a total cash war chest of **$6.9M** (nice). Not great, not terrible, but enough to push the business forward until more deals hit.

# Why Trump’s Win Makes ONDS a Buy

* **Border Security**: Drones patrolling the wall? Perfect synergy.
* **Defense Spending**: Counter-drone tech, mission-critical networks, and AI systems are top priorities for securing the homeland.
* **Infrastructure**: Ondas’ railroad tech plays into the MAGA promise of fixing “America’s crumbling infrastructure.” We’re talking $$$ contracts for upgrades.
* **Drones are HOT:** Just look at what happened with RCAT over the last month. This sector is just getting started and the upside potential on this is huge.

# But What Could Go Wrong? 🙃

1. **Cashflow Problems**: $6.9M is better than $2.9M, but they’ll still need more funding to grow. Not a biggie if they keep closing deals, though.
2. **Competition**: The drone market is heating up. ONDS has niche tech, but staying ahead of the pack won’t be easy.
3. **Execution Risks**: Scaling hardware + software tech isn’t simple. They’ve gotta deliver.

# My Bullish Thesis

Ondas is the perfect storm of defense, tech, and MAGA-era spending priorities. The Trump administration is a literal gold mine for this kind of tech. Drones on the border? Check. Counter-drone systems for Homeland Security? Check. Rail upgrades for MAGA’s infrastructure promises? Check.

ONDS isn’t just a bet on drones. It’s a bet on *Murica*.

# Final Thoughts

ONDS is a high-risk, high-reward play. They’ve got the tech, the partnerships, and the perfect timing with Trump’s focus on defense and infrastructure. If this stock doesn’t moon by Q2 2025, I’ll eat my portfolio (don’t quote me on that).

Buy the dip, hodl through the turbulence, and let’s ride these drone tendies to the moon. **Not financial advice, apes. Do your own DD!** 🚀",TSLA,Tesla

So, check this out.

# Palantir Technologies (yes, that Palantir) just dropped $1.27M buying shares at $1.25 and now own 10 percent of $SRFM

***Their CEO (Stan Little) built Mokulele Airlines into Hawaii's biggest commuter airline before joining SRFM.*** 

TLDR 🎯

* $4.66 penny stock that's actually doing something real
* Palantir keeps buying (1.27M shares recently) 🐋
* 33.59 percent insider buying last month (that's huge btw)
* Just got $50M in fresh cash
* Electric planes + Palantir AI = 🚀

The Juicy Stuff 💰

* $118M revenue and growing fas
* Got exclusive deals with Cessna's parent company
* Already signing up airlines worldwide
* Think Tesla but for small planes

Why I'm Watching 👀

* Palantir isn't stupid - they see something here
* Everyone's talking EVs, but nobody's talking electric planes yet
* They've got real revenue, real partners, real planes
* Stock's still cheap compared to other EV plays

The ""But Wait..."" Part ⚠️

* Yeah, they're losing money (like early Tesla)
* Aviation stuff takes forever to approve
* It's still early days
* Don't yeet your rent money at this

*Not financial advice. Don't own any shares (yet).*

2024-12-05,23:28:03,pennystocks,KULR is the Future: Strategic Bitcoin Play Could Make This Penny Stock a Multi-Bagger ,"Alright, /r/pennystocks, let’s get serious for a second. I know we all love a good moonshot, but hear me out on why $KULR isn’t just another penny stock—it’s a sleeping giant.

So, KULR just announced they’re taking their excess treasury cash and putting it into Bitcoin. Naturally, people are out here talking trash, saying things like, “Speculative penny stock dipping into another speculative asset? Big risk!” To that, I say: Exactly. This isn’t a reckless gamble—it’s a brilliant strategy for exponential growth.

Here’s why:
1️⃣ BTC as a Strategic Reserve
We’ve already seen big players like MicroStrategy and Tesla add Bitcoin to their treasuries. Why? Because it’s an asymmetric bet on long-term value. For a company like $KULR with cutting-edge tech in thermal energy management and battery safety, this move signals they’re not just trying to survive—they’re playing offense.

2️⃣ Insane Risk/Reward
Let’s be real, we’re not buying penny stocks for their blue-chip stability. We’re here for moonshots. The combo of KULR’s strong business fundamentals and a BTC kicker could supercharge the stock. The downside is limited (it’s a penny stock anyway), but the upside? A potential market cap of $5B or more. That’s a minimum target IMO.

3️⃣ Ignore the Haters
People whining about “speculation” need to get a grip. KULR’s tech is already in high demand—they’re working with NASA, the military, and EV manufacturers. Adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet doesn’t weaken their core—it adds a high-risk, high-reward asset to amplify shareholder returns.

4️⃣ Perfect Timing

With Bitcoin showing signs of another bull cycle, this move could significantly increase their liquidity. Think of Bitcoin as the ultimate asymmetric hedge—it’s speculative, sure, but the rewards FAR outweigh the risks for a growth-stage company like KULR.

In summary:

This isn’t some pump-and-dump vaporware. KULR has legit tech, real clients, and a bold strategy to maximize growth. The Bitcoin play is a cherry on top—a calculated move to leverage speculative growth alongside their core business. Risk is the name of the game with penny stocks, and this one is worth it.

My price target? $10+ short term, $30+ long term. If their Bitcoin gamble pays off, this stock could go parabolic. Don’t miss the boat. 🚀

Thoughts? Critics? Let’s discuss.

EDIT:

Holy shit, look at the numbers… 

https://i.imgur.com/6FlSDIx.jpeg

71.8K views in just 6 hours and 6.6K in the past hour alone! Clearly, this is catching fire, and for good reason. KULR’s decision to allocate up to 90% of their cash reserves into Bitcoin isn’t just a bold move—it’s a game-changer.

Not many companies, especially at this level, are thinking like this. While others are playing it safe and hoarding cash, KULR is taking a strategic risk to position themselves as a forward-thinking innovator. This isn’t just about Bitcoin—it’s about showing they’re willing to think outside the box and embrace growth opportunities that most companies are too hesitant to touch.

This level of attention proves people are starting to recognize the significance of this move. Whether you’re bullish or skeptical, you can’t deny that KULR is making waves. Huge moves like this don’t happen every day in penny stocks. Keep watching—this could be the start of something massive.

2024-12-02,11:37:34,pennystocks,Research and detailed analysis on High Tide inc ( $HITI : Nasdaq),"**Background** \- How [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) became the leading cannabis retailer in Canada



**The beginning**:

Raj Grover, the founder and CEO who owns \~9% of the company and has never sold a single share (not even when it was trading 5x higher than it is today), comes from an entrepreneurial family and had already experienced success with several smaller businesses before establishing [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click). During a business trip to India in search of opportunities in fashion accessories or body jewelry, Raj stumbled upon the potential of cannabis consumption accessories. Recognizing the margin arbitrage opportunity, he shipped $10,000 worth of consumption accessories from New Delhi to Canada and sold everything overnight. After replicating this success a few more times, Raj decided to open a store. **This marked the beginning of High Tide's story**.

In 2009, Raj opened Smokers’ Corner with an initial investment of less than $50,000 and grew it into a multimillion-dollar empire. At that time, there were only two or three competitors with unappealing stores. Raj believed that by creating a differentiated store in a smart location, he could easily capture market share, and he was right. By leveraging his established roots in Indonesia, Thailand, China, and India, he was able to not only provide a better customer experience but also offer much cheaper products.

**Cannabis legalization in Canada**:

Always looking to stay ahead, Raj seized the opportunity when the Prime Minister of Canada announced that recreational cannabis would soon be legalized. With an existing customer base of cannabis users, it made perfect sense for Raj to expand into selling cannabis itself. He realized that if he only sold accessories, he would eventually lose customers to shops that offered both cannabis and accessories.

After nine years of focusing on consumption accessories and accumulating nearly $10M in retained earnings, Raj raised $88.5M for the first time in 2018 and ventured into the equity markets, marking **the beginning of High Tide's journey as a publicly traded company**. With easier access to capital when compared to its peers, High Tide expanded its footprint across Canada, highlighted by the significant acquisition of its competitor Meta in 2020, which increased the number of stores from 37 to 67.

**The strategy shift that made everything change**:

Around the same time, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) began acquiring e-commerce businesses selling accessories and CBD-related products (mostly oils) with higher margin profiles, **a pivotal decision for the company**. From acquiring several brands in the U.S., such as Smoke Cartel, FABCBD, Daily High Club, DankStop, and NuLeaf Holdings, to later acquiring BlessedCBD in the UK, High Tide leveraged its market power to **enhance margins** and diversify its revenue streams.

In the summer of 2021, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) was accepted for listing on the Nasdaq, marking a significant milestone.

Later that year, a transformative decision was made: **High Tide launched a discount club model for its retail stores in October 2021**. With consolidated margins higher than any competitor due to the previously mentioned CBD-related acquisitions, High Tide could offer cannabis at remarkably low prices, **attracting loyal members and rapidly gaining market share**.

Although this discount model initially involved selling cannabis at a loss, **the move proved to be incredibly successful**. High Tide's market share increased from less than 4% to over 10% in less than three years, despite representing less than 5% of the total cannabis retail store count. **Today, the discount model program has more than 1.5M members and continues to grow each quarter**.

Being the first-of-its-kind discount model was the key differentiating factor that propelled High Tide to become the leading cannabis retailer in Canada. **No competitor could match their prices**, and Raj targeted cannabis users who consumed regularly and were highly price-sensitive.

When I first started investing in High Tide, one of its closest competitors was Fire & Flower Holdings, which ultimately went bankrupt following this price war. There are many more examples of competitors that went bankrupt following this (Four20, Tokyo Smoke, etc), showing how strong [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) has become in the sector. And the consolidation of the market in Canada is just starting.

This strategy also significantly diminished the illicit market, further strengthening High Tide’s market share.

**After capturing market share, it was time to turn profitable**:

While Raj sacrificed margins to achieve this, economies of scale and several initiatives aimed at improving margins allowed [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) to become **positive free cash flow** again in 2023 (\~8% margin as of last quarter), as well as **positive net income** in the most recent quarterly results, with a consolidated leadership position stronger than ever.

Overall, **High Tide took a calculated risk to become the leader in the country**, and it proved to be incredibly successful. This success was only possible due to the CEO's extensive experience in the sector and deep understanding of the cannabis consumer, surpassing that of any other management team.

**What's next for** [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)**?** \- The best is yet to come.

While the focus on becoming FCF+ led to a notable deceleration in revenue growth, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) **is now returning to its high-growth strategy**.

Despite cannabis being legal for over five years, there's still significant market potential to capture in Canada.

A recent regulatory change in Ontario now allows one company to operate up to 150 recreational cannabis stores, doubling the previous cap of 75. This change is benefiting large retail chains like [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click). Raj Grover has outlined plans to open 20-30 stores this year (already opened 20 so far), capitalizing on the opportunity and targeting the high presence of the illicit market in the region.

Moreover, the Canadian market is experiencing significant consolidation, allowing High Tide to expand its market share organically and through acquisitions at depressed multiples. For example, High Tide recently acquired a store for 1.5x last quarter's annualized Adj. EBITDA. The CEO mentioned in the last earnings call that he's in negotiations with a sizable player to acquire additional stores, aiming to accelerate its footprint expansion and surpass this year's initial target.

Every month there are dozens of cannabis stores closing in Canada because they simply can't compete with [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click).

Over the next two years, High Tide is expected to reach a 15% market share, up from 12% today.

It's worth mentioning that Raj and his team have always been methodical in selecting store locations, ensuring each one yields significant returns, which is why the annual revenue per store at [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) surpasses the industry average by a wide margin.

Over the next three to five years, there's **potential to reach an annual revenue of $1B in Canada alone**.

[$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is one of the very few cannabis companies that **does NOT depend on any new legislation** to keep growing and improving its bottom-line numbers.

Ongoing developments in the U.S. might give [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) the green light to expand there.

High Tide, with its vast e-commerce base of over 3M U.S. customers and profitable operations, is poised to leverage these developments. Raj Grover’s strategic approach as a second mover allows him to avoid pitfalls and strategically open stores in key states. The company is ready to capitalize on its strong foundation and scale efficiently, aiming to secure significant market share with well-chosen locations and a clear expansion strategy.

Most U.S. operators struggle to turn a profit even with gross margins in the 40-50% range, while [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is both FCF and net income profitable with a gross margin below 30%.

While **the company doesn’t depend on the U.S. market to continue growing**, this presents an additional catalyst for its upcoming growth trajectory.

Regardless of whether this expansion happens quickly or not, these developments will attract a wave of new investors to the sector and contribute to an overall expansion in multiples.

High Tide is becoming the **Costco of Cannabis**

After the success of its free discount model, which gathered over 1.5M members in under three years, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) launched ELITE, **a paid membership with even better offers**.

The rollout began slowly, but **membership is now growing at a record pace** — 226% YoY and 38% QoQ last quarter.

It's worth noting that this growth is happening while the subscription price is being raised.

Although the absolute number is still relatively small, at 46,000, the conversion rate of regular club members to ELITE ones is getting better every quarter. You only need to make a small purchase for the membership price to pay for itself, it's exactly like [$COST](https://x.com/search?q=%24COST&src=cashtag_click).

The long-term vision is for High Tide to be the [$COST](https://x.com/search?q=%24COST&src=cashtag_click) of cannabis, **driving strong and predictable cash flows and strengthening High Tide's competitive edge**.

I believe this is one of the catalysts that will help [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) further improve bottom line margins.

Despite being a retailer with relatively low margins, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)'s gross and FCF margins (\~8% as of last quarter) have **room to grow**.

Cannabis prices in Canada are just starting to stabilize, and [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is waiting for full market stabilization before aggressively launching white labels. While many independents are closing and the market is consolidating, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) isn’t raising prices yet to avoid aiding competitors. **The long-term strategy is to leverage pricing power gradually**.

When I asked the CEO if [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)'s FCF margins are nearing a peak, the response was clear: No, **there are still many growth opportunities**. As the market consolidates and [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)'s market share increases, they anticipate further improvements in both gross and FCF margins, plus new areas to explore with scale and other initiatives.

**Valuation** \- [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is the most superior cannabis business, yet the cheapest.

Retail investors in Canada alone have lost over $130B since the 2017 bubble popped, so I understand why everyone is wary of this sector.

But I have demonstrated how [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is different from the most well-known cannabis companies like [$CGC](https://x.com/search?q=%24CGC&src=cashtag_click), [$TLRY](https://x.com/search?q=%24TLRY&src=cashtag_click), [$ACB](https://x.com/search?q=%24ACB&src=cashtag_click), and others. **High Tide generates strong FCF and has a track record of consistently impressive execution**.

Most importantly, it has a highly aligned management team that cares about shareholders, which is rare in the sector.

The fact that this sector is at its peak of pessimism is what makes it possible for us to buy [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) at such a cheap valuation.

It's also worth mentioning that, unlike the other names mentioned, High Tide went public late in the game and was not part of the bubble in 2017-2018. That's why it is so underfollowed and why most people don't even know about it.Let's check the numbers.

[$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) generated CAD $22.7M in FCF over the last 12 months, so it is currently trading at 10x LTM FCF. It's worth noting that this was the first full year of FCF profitability, so this number should improve further from here.



[$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is **the best-performing retail cannabis company** and one of the very few that is already generating both FCF and net income, **yet it remains the cheapest**.

Faster growth + better margins + a superior management team + a winning business model + the lowest valuation = **a complete bargain**, at least in my view.

While most investors are avoiding this sector due to the well-known companies that destroy shareholder value, I'm taking advantage of this opportunity by investing in what I consider a hidden gem.



Before finishing, I'd like to highlight this:

[$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) has **less than 10% institutional ownership**, while over 75% of the market is owned by institutions.

**Peter Lynch often talks about this**. If you want to achieve multibagger returns, find a hidden gem before the institutions do.

For greater understanding look at the company presentation, since images are not allowed, in the presentation they better reflect the overview and the deep competitive moat that the company enjoys

$XBOT
[**Elon Musk**](https://www.tmz.com/people/elon-musk/) will be able to be in 2 places at once when he starts his new government position in 2025 ... that is, if he takes one robot company up on a very generous offer.

In a letter addressed to the Tesla CEO and obtained by TMZ ... [**Realbotix**]$XBOT (https://www.realbotix.ai/), a create your own robot company, offered to design a ""one-of-a-kind humanoid robot"" modeled after the businessman -- mannerisms and all.

More specifically, the robot will replicate Elon's look ""perfectly,"" have a customized voice to match EM's, track cryptocurrency prices, move around on its own, maintain eye contact, among other notable perks.

As the company's CEO **Andrew Kiguel** put it ... the ""Elon Bot"" would allow the tech giant to have a physical extension of his ""ideas and persona"" ... promising their droid's are ""capable of learning and communicating with precision.""

Andrew, who praised Elon for Tesla's debut of the Optimus robot, suggested his company's bot could be helpful for EM as he steps into his new role as the co-lead of the Department of Government Efficiency.

Elon isn't expected to give up his business endeavors while serving in Trump's administration ... which is why Realbotix has made their generous offer.

Andrew added ... ""Imagine a version of yourself always available to inspire innovation, advocate for progress, and interact with world leaders and citizens alike.""

Elon wouldn't be the first celebrity to get a Realbotix doppelganger, however ... back in 2018, comedian [**Whitney Cummings**](https://www.tmz.com/people/whitney-cummings/) famously had the company make a bot-version of herself -- and she was thoroughly pleased with the results.

A lot has changed since then, as we're told the droids are *way* more advanced now.

Bots in the White House ... what could go wrong???

2024-11-01,18:28:09,pennystocks,3 Penny Stocks to add to your watchlist in November 2024 -  Stocksy's Weekly DD,"Hey everyone! Here are some notes on some of my favourite plays atm. McCoy has been recommended to me several times on past post, and now I understand why, solid company. Still just waiting on these GLM drill results, and I just like ZOMD's growth prospects. Hope this DD can be of value to anyone. Please feel free to recommend any tickers you would like me to check out! Cheers

  
**McCoy Global $MCCRF $MCB.TO**

Market cap: 99m

Company Overview

McCoy Global develops equipment and technology for the energy and industrial sectors, especially oil and gas. Their lineup includes tools like hydraulic power tongs and digital solutions like smartHUB and Virtual Thread-Rep, which are designed to streamline operations and bring data insights to drilling sites. 

  


**Highlights**

McCoy’s last quarter was pretty solid. They pulled in $19.9m in revenue, up 23% from last year (not bad for a company in a cyclical industry). Earnings had a major boost too. Net income shot up by 119%, landing at $3.1m compared to $1.4m last year.

One big reason McCoy’s doing well is their FMS tool. This tool makes the process of handling pipes a lot easier and safer. Instead of needing extra manual tools, the FMS has replaceable parts that grip and release pipes quickly, which means fewer crew members are needed on the job. This setup saves both time and money for operators, which is why field crews are starting to rely on it, especially in tough conditions where efficiency and safety are key. Simply put, the FMS is solving real problems, and that’s why it’s boosting McCoy’s sales.

McCoy’s growth is also coming from a big push into international markets, especially in the Eastern Hemisphere. They used to be focused mainly on North America, but now, around 60% of their revenue is coming from overseas.

This matters because it makes them less dependent on any one region. Their tools, like the FMS, are catching on with companies abroad who are focused on efficiency. By spreading their business across more markets, they set themselves up with a more reliable revenue stream, even if one area slows down.

Also, they got $9 million in cash and no debt, giving them the flexibility to keep growing without needing outside financing

  


**Zoomd Technologies Ltd. $ZMDTF $ZOMD.V\\**

Market cap: 52m (already up 30% since my post on them last month)

Company Overview

Zoomd operates in the digital ad tech space, specializing in mobile-focused, KPI-driven advertising solutions. Their tech helps brands navigate advertising channels outside major platforms like Google and Meta, providing a unified service for customer acquisition across various media types. Zoomd’s platform allows clients to efficiently manage and optimize ad campaigns on multiple channels, from social media to programmatic ad networks, all while maintaining clear, KPI-based results.



**Highlights**

Zoomd brought in $22.7 million in revenue in the first half of 2024, up 30% from last year. By focusing in on their core, high-performing products, they’ve made a strong turnaround with net income hitting $2.1 million in Q2 2024 compared to previous losses. They cut operating expenses by 21%, which helped drive adjusted ebitda to $3.03m, nearly 700% higher than last year. This shift toward core services and discontinuing less profitable products is clearly doing well for them.

Zoomd’s approach is a big plus for brands aiming to grow internationally. Their platform makes reaching audiences across regions like North America and Europe easier by offering a range of media options, so brands aren’t limited by regional ad restrictions. This flexibility gives companies the reach they need to effectively connect with global markets.

Another strength for Zoomd is their client retention. Their top 10 clients have stayed with them for over three years on average, which speaks to strong client satisfaction and effective campaign management. With this high retention and a diverse client base, Zoomd is building a steady stream of recurring revenue as they continue to expand globally.

  
  


**Golden Lake Exploration $GOLXF $GLM.CN**

Market cap: 6m (first post was around 3m)

Company Overview

Golden Lake Exploration is a junior mining company focused on the Jewel Ridge property in Nevada's Battle Mountain-Eureka Gold Trend, a prolific gold-producing area.



**Highlights**

Jewel Ridge is in a great location within the Battle Mountain-Eureka Trend, an area that has produced over 40 million ounces of gold historically. This site is surrounded by major projects like i-80 Gold's (540M MC)  Ruby Hill, which has over 7.73 million ounces of gold, and McEwen Mining’s (633M MC) Gold bar project.

Historical drilling at Jewel Ridge has shown promising results. Notable intercepts include **56.39 meters of 1.24 g/t gold and 10.67 meters of 4.79 g/t gold.**

The Eureka Tunnel target is another highlight, yielding **3.23 meters of 57.16 g/t gold, 452.03 g/t silver, 7.23% lead, and 11.99% zinc**. This intercept resulted in Eric Sprott building a position in the company as one of the top shareholders.

I’m mentioning GLM in this post because they just recently started drilling and have some very promising targets. One of the key areas is Magnet Ridge, which spans an 800-meter-long anomaly in a well-known gold corridor. This anomaly was identified through geophysical surveys and shows a strong chargeability response, hinting at the potential for sulphide minerals, which are associated with precious metals. I’m expecting these drill results to be released in the next few weeks.

Earlier drilling nearby hit 5.13 g/t gold over 5.43 meters near the surface. Now, they’re going deeper into the core of the anomaly, where the chargeability is 10x stronger, making it a much more interesting target. With promising geology and high-priority drill spots, this setup looks pretty solid. I just think there is a decent chance for some good finds, and the current risk-to-reward isn’t bad at all, considering if they hit anything like they did in the past, it could run hard in this market. 

Plus, that is only the target I am most optimistic about, they have some other solid ones as well.

","Hong Kong-based online financial services and healthcare platform operator AGBA Group Holding Ltd. (NASDAQ: AGBA) might win the award for the most unusual stock split of the year. On Oct. 2, 2024, the company conducted a 122-for-63 stock split earlier this month with shares beginning trading on a split-adjusted basis on Oct. 2. AGBA shareholders also voted on Sept. 19, 2024, to authorize the company's board of directors to conduct a reverse stock split in the range of 1-for-1.5 to 1-for-20.

2024-09-30,21:54:40,pennystocks,The Race for U.S. Lithium Independence in the EV Revolution,"* **Lithium demand is projected to quadruple by 2030, driven by the electric vehicle boom and increasing global energy storage needs.**
* **Li-FT Power has strengthened its lithium portfolio through key projects in Canada, including its recent acquisition of 9,681 hectares in the Little Nahanni Pegmatite District.**
* **With a price target of $9.25 CAD and a potential upside of 240%, Li-FT Power offers a strong investment opportunity in the growing lithium market.**  


The electric vehicle (EV) boom, led by companies like Tesla, Nio, and Stellantis, has brought global attention to lithium, a vital resource for the EV industry. Governments and corporations are racing to secure it for future energy needs. Despite having its own lithium reserves, the United States currently produces only 1% of the global supply, making it heavily dependent on foreign sources, especially China. To safeguard its energy future and reduce reliance on geopolitical rivals, the U.S. must ramp up domestic lithium production significantly.

  
**Lithium Abundance vs. Production Concentration**  
Though lithium is widely distributed across the globe, its production is dominated by a handful of countries. Australia, Chile, China, and Argentina produce over 95% of the world’s lithium. However, the United States holds significant untapped reserves, particularly in Nevada, North Carolina, and California. These states are estimated to contain about 4% of the world’s lithium deposits, making the U.S. home to some of the largest reserves outside the Lithium Triangle in South America. Despite this, U.S. production remains limited compared to global leaders.  
As the electric vehicle (EV) industry accelerates, lithium demand is projected to surge. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence forecasts that by 2030, annual lithium demand will hit 2.4 million tons, four times the expected production for 2024. To support this growing need, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduces $370 billion in incentives for domestic EV and battery production, aiming to reduce reliance on imports. Additionally, earlier in 2023, the Department of Energy committed $3 billion to boost the U.S. EV supply chain, following the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s passage, which further emphasizes localizing production and bolstering the clean energy industry.

  
*“This initiative is going to coordinate the effort across the federal government and work closely with the private sector, labor unions, Tribes, community organizations, and our partners and allies abroad… It’s going to secure America’s electric vehicle battery supply chain and clean energy future”*  
*President Joe Biden*

  
**China’s Strategic Control Over the Lithium Supply Chain**  
China’s dominance over the global lithium supply chain is a result of strategic investments and policies aimed at controlling critical minerals. According to a 2021 White House report, between 2009 and 2019, China funneled $100 billion in subsidies, rebates, and tax exemptions to its companies and consumers to capture the lithium refining market before demand skyrocketed. This gave China a powerful position as both the largest consumer of unrefined lithium and the leading producer of refined lithium.  
China has employed anti-competitive tactics, such as subsidizing production even when demand was low and dumping products at below-market prices to outcompete international players. Chinese companies have also invested heavily in lithium mines around the world, ensuring their access to the supply. This strategy mirrors China’s actions in controlling other critical minerals like cobalt, graphite, and nickel, further entrenching its global mineral dominance.

  
*“America must reduce its reliance on China and other adversaries for critical minerals… Our nation’s dependence on foreign sources for these materials creates a serious threat to our national and economic security”*  
*Senator Gary Peters*

  
**My Stock Pick: Li-FT Power for America’s Independency**  
The reason why I am mentioning Li-FT Power (TSXV: LIFT, OTC: LIFFF, FRA: WS0) is because the company focuses on acquiring, exploring, and developing high-potential lithium pegmatite projects in Canada. Its flagship asset, the Yellowknife Lithium Project in the Northwest Territories, is key, covering a large portion of the Yellowknife Pegmatite Province, known for significant lithium pegmatite formations. Along with this, Li-FT holds three promising early-stage exploration properties in Quebec and is advancing the Cali Project in the Little Nahanni Pegmatite Group, further strengthening its position in the lithium market.  
On September 3, 2024, Li-FT Power announced a significant expansion of its operational area in the Little Nahanni Pegmatite District, located in the Northwest Territories, Canada. The company acquired an additional 9,681 hectares at its Cali Project, which includes outcropping spodumene pegmatites—a crucial lithium-bearing mineral—linked to the broader Cali dyke swarm that the company has been actively mapping.  
This expansion was made possible following the Nááts’ı̨hch’oh Amendments to the Sahtú Land Use Plan in June 2024, which provided new opportunities for staking claims in the region. These amendments were expected after receiving endorsement from the Sahtú Secretariat Incorporated and the Government of the Northwest Territories back in 2019.  
As of September 20, 2024, Li-FT Power’s stock is trading at $2.72 CAD, with a market capitalization of $107.24 million CAD. In terms of future projections, analysts have set a 12-month price target of $9.25 CAD, representing a potential upside of 240.07%, with estimates ranging from a low of $8.50 CAD to a high of $10.00 CAD. The company’s share structure includes 42.7 million outstanding shares and an additional 1.07 million options, for a fully diluted total of 43.8 million shares. Ownership remains concentrated, with 55% held by founders, 17% by institutional investors, 25% by retail investors, and 3% by management and directors. Top institutional shareholders include Commodity Capital AG, Extract Capital, and Tribeca Investment Partners.

  
**Conclusion**  
Lithium is becoming an increasingly vital resource as the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) surges, yet production remains concentrated in a few countries like Australia, Chile, China, and Argentina. While the U.S. holds significant untapped reserves, production has not kept pace with global leaders. To address this, the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provide substantial funding to boost domestic lithium production and reduce reliance on China, which dominates the lithium refining market. Companies like Li-FT Power are poised to benefit from these trends, with their strategic lithium projects in Canada. Recent expansions in the Northwest Territories position Li-FT to capitalize on rising demand. With analysts projecting a 240% stock price increase, Li-FT offers strong growth potential, supported by its concentrated ownership and promising lithium assets.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-09-27,22:37:12,pennystocks,MMAT Bankruptcy Update And $3M Investor Settlement News,"Hey guys, I guess there are some MMAT investors here, and you all know about the bankruptcy.  They already ceased operations, and since a few weeks ago, have been in complete control of a trustee.



For newbies, a few years ago Meta Materials was involved in a scandal with Torchlight deal due to claims of exaggeration about their business ties and product innovation (and they were also accused of overpricing). After all of that, they got investigated by the SEC and also hit with lawsuits from investors.



The good news we got early this year was that they finally agreed to pay a $3M settlement to solve this scandal. But now, I found out that they´re accepting claims even after the deadline. So, if someone's late, you can still check the info and [file for it](https://11thestate.com/cases/meta-materials-shareholder-settlement).



And has anyone here had $MMAT when the Torchlight scandal happened? If so, how much were your losses?

Here are some notes from companies that I have been looking at this week. Good lord kraken has been climbinggg. ZOMD and BOLT both new mentions for me but they both look super solid. Hope this can be of value to anyone. Please feel free to comment any tickers you would like me to checkout! Cheers

**ZOMD Technologies $ZOMD.V**

Market Cap: 40M

Company Overview:

Zoomd Technologies provides digital marketing solutions focused on user acquisition, primarily in the mobile space. The company operates beyond the usual Google and Meta channels, offering clients access to a range of media sources. This gives advertisers flexibility and allows them to diversify their marketing efforts, all managed from one platform.

**Highlights**

Zoomd’s Q2 2024 results showed impressive growth, with revenue jumping by 58% compared to the same quarter last year. They brought in $13.98M in Q2 2024, up from $8.82M in Q2 2023. What stands out most is their net profit of $2.15M, a clear turnaround from the $785K loss they reported in the same period last year. This also makes it their fifth quarter in a row of profitability, which shows that their recent efforts to refocus the business are working.

Cost control has been a big part of the story. They cut operating expenses by 21%, which helped boost their adjusted EBITDA to $3.03M, nearly 700% higher than last year. The company’s move to discontinue less profitable products and concentrate on core services has paid off.

What caught my eye about Zoomd is how they’ve set themselves apart from the typical Google and Meta reliance. They give advertisers the flexibility to use a wider range of channels like SDK networks and programmatic ads, which opens up more options and control for their clients. This is why I see a lot of room for Zoomd to grow. As more advertisers look for ways to diversify and spread their marketing dollars beyond the big players, Zoomd is well-positioned to benefit from that shift

On the client side, retention is solid. Over 90% of their top customers have stuck around for more than three years, which obviously shows that once companies start working with Zoomd, they see enough value to stay on board long-term.

**Kraken Robotics Inc.  $KRKNF $PNG.V**

Market Cap:  400M (Up 75% since first post)

Company Overview:

Kraken Robotics is a Canadian marine technology company specializing in advanced sonar and optical sensors, subsea batteries, and robotics for unmanned underwater vehicles. They serve both military and commercial sectors, offering solutions that include high-resolution imaging for defence, offshore energy, and subsea infrastructure monitoring.

**Highlights**

Kraken’s Q2 2024 results were impressive, with revenue climbing 67% to $22.8M compared to $13.7M in Q2 2023. The bulk of this growth came from product sales, which jumped 83%, thanks to continued demand for key offerings like their subsea batteries and KATFISH system.

Kraken ended Q2 with $20.4M in cash, boosted by a $20M equity financing and $45M in new credit facilities. This solid financial foundation supports Kraken’s ambitious growth plans, including ramping up production and expanding into new markets, with projected 2024 revenue of $90M-$100M and ebitda of $18M-$24M.

Kraken has been steadily building an impressive pipeline of contracts. They’ve recently secured more than $8M in subsea battery orders, along with an $8M acoustic corer project, and a $3.7M KATFISH-related order. These deals are part of a broader pipeline Kraken estimates to be worth over **$900M** in identified opportunities.

Kraken has locked in some big, multi-year deals with major clients like NATO navies and the Canadian Navy. Their ability to keep key customers coming back, including large players in offshore energy, really shows how much trust there is in Kraken’s technology and the value they consistently deliver in both defence and commercial markets.

Kraken just seems like a solid bet at this point. Some may find it a bit expensive, but if they hit their projected revenue of 90M-100M, that would be their fourth year in a row of nearly doubling their revenue. The company is just firing on all cylinders.

**Bolt Metals Corp. $PCRCF $BOLT.CN**

Market Cap: 4M

Company Overview:

Bolt Metals Corp. is a Canadian exploration company focused on securing and advancing key metals projects in North America. Their portfolio is centred on critical metals like antimony and copper.

**Highlights**

What I like about BOLT is that they have some super promising projects that are largely unexplored despite strong historical results.

The New Britain Antimony and Gold Project in British Columbia, for example, spans over 2,400 hectares and has already shown high-grade samples, including **10.4% antimony, 9.7 g/t gold, and 2,358 g/t silver.** These numbers are impressive, but what’s even more intriguing is that the site remains mostly untouched when it comes to modern exploration.

For those of you who have no idea what antimony is… don’t worry, I didn’t either. But it turns out that this critical metal has been experiencing a supply crunch, and the price has nearly doubled in 2024. China, which controls the majority of the world’s antimony production, has tightened exports, which has driven prices up dramatically. With barely any domestic companies exploring for antimony, this only scarcity boosts Bolt Metals’ position.

Soap Gulch is their other promising asset in Bolt’s portfolio, with great potential for copper and zinc. Historical drilling has already delivered copper grades as high as 4.7%, along with solid results in zinc and gold. What makes this project even more exciting is the opportunity Bolt has to leverage existing data. They’ve got 5,000 meters of historical drill core that has never been sampled for copper. This is a huge advantage, as they can analyze this core without having to launch an expensive new drilling program, potentially saving them around CAD $3.4 million.

On top of that, a 2018 airborne geophysics survey identified several untested anomalies, which are essentially indicators of subsurface structures that might contain additional mineral deposits. These anomalies suggest that there could be even more copper and zinc hidden beneath the surface, adding to the project’s untapped potential. If Bolt can confirm what the historical data hints at, Soap Gulch could become a valuable copper play in a strong market.

PLUS, It looks like Bolt Metals is about to add another promising project to their portfolio with the Silver Switchback property. Early surface sampling has shown impressive results, with **1,975 g/t silver, 17.01% copper, and 0.48 g/t gold.** The property, has never been drilled, but the existing permit is valid until 2027, making it drill-ready too. Management is excited about this one and sees it as a key part of their growth plan, with a solid exploration program in the works to uncover more silver and copper. It could definitely be a strong addition to their portfolio.

ALL OF THIS while still maintaining a strong cap structure. Bolt has a tight share structure with only 8.9M shares fully diluted and 42% insider ownership.

2024-09-24,23:51:30,pennystocks,Opportunities in Hydrogen,"There's a lot of opportunity in the hydrogen sector. Governments and businesses are investing big money to make this happen. 

One example is Texas, who aims to be the hydrogen capital of the world.

Texas received a $70 million grant from the Federal Highway Administration supporting the creation of a hydrogen trucking corridor for medium and heavy-duty trucks. The funding will go toward the construction of up to five stations across Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin and San Antonio, with the eventual goal of building a corridor between Texas and Southern California.

Additionally, Texas is the site of the HyVelocity Hydrogen Hub, one of seven regional clean hydrogen hubs selected by the U.S. Department of Energy to receive up to $1.2 billion in funding. HyVelocity Hub participants Air Liquide, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Sempra Infrastructure are also part of the Texas Hydrogen Alliance.

Let's not forget Japan, who have bet big on Hydrogen as well.

Japan’s first strategy, released in December 2017, was the world’s first national hydrogen strategy; however, the energy landscape has changed drastically since then. Japan’s revised strategy intends to generate public and private sector investment in hydrogen worth 15 trillion yen (NZD173.4bn) over the next 15 years, and increase the use of hydrogen six fold by 2040.

Then you have vehicle makers like BMW, Honda, Skoda, Hyundai, Toyota, Tesla investing in hydrogen tech as well. 

One Hydrogen company which is bringing innovation to the sector is SunHydrogen ($HYSR)
They have recently joined the Texas Hydrogen Alliance and will be a key player in the production of hydrogen. 

The examples I have provided are just a small sample of what's happening in the sector. There's an abundance of investment and innovation currently and I truly believe any barriers will be broken over the coming years.

2024-09-17,14:52:37,pennystocks,$LIFFF - another mining stock in prime position to benefit from the EV revolution.,"As of late, it hasn’t been looking too good for Donald Trump; from an unbiased point of view, it seems like the abundance of sentiment that arose post-assassination attempt has fed from those hitting the polls come Election Day.

So I thought to myself, “what markets stand to benefit from a Kamala Harris victory?”

**EV producers…**

But then I read here on Reddit that mining stocks are on the rise, and after some research I’m inclined to agree with said OP. But you can’t mine electricity, so who’s to supply for the surplus of electric vehicles being produced by Tesla and other companies…

**Lithium miners.**

Since lithium is a key mineral necessary for the production of large, rechargeable batteries, I went looking around to see who might be in a solid market position for the amount of lithium necessary to power this EV revolution, leading me to Li-FT Power Ltd. (TSXV: Li-FT | $LIFTF).

$LIFTF is a Canadian-based lithium mining company that’s primary business involves the acquisition, exploration, and development of hard rock lithium properties. It was announced recently that the company “quadrupled the size” of their large mining project within Northwest Territories, Canada, nicknamed “the Cali Project.” It’s said they have an additional 9,681 hectares of claims upon government approval of an amendment that allows new staking to be completed in the area.  [Here’s the full article for more information on the developments.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lift-quadruples-size-cali-property-140000940.html)

I plan on looking a lot further into this company. Stay tuned for a deeper dive into the fundamentals!

2024-09-14,11:36:31,pennystocks, Research and detailed analysis on High Tide inc ( $HITI : Nasdaq) ,"**Background** - How [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) became the leading cannabis retailer in Canada

**The beginning**:

Raj Grover, the founder and CEO who owns \~9% of the company and has never sold a single share (not even when it was trading 5x higher than it is today), comes from an entrepreneurial family and had already experienced success with several smaller businesses before establishing [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click). During a business trip to India in search of opportunities in fashion accessories or body jewelry, Raj stumbled upon the potential of cannabis consumption accessories. Recognizing the margin arbitrage opportunity, he shipped $10,000 worth of consumption accessories from New Delhi to Canada and sold everything overnight. After replicating this success a few more times, Raj decided to open a store. **This marked the beginning of High Tide's story**.

In 2009, Raj opened Smokers’ Corner with an initial investment of less than $50,000 and grew it into a multimillion-dollar empire. At that time, there were only two or three competitors with unappealing stores. Raj believed that by creating a differentiated store in a smart location, he could easily capture market share, and he was right. By leveraging his established roots in Indonesia, Thailand, China, and India, he was able to not only provide a better customer experience but also offer much cheaper products.

**Cannabis legalization in Canada**:

Always looking to stay ahead, Raj seized the opportunity when the Prime Minister of Canada announced that recreational cannabis would soon be legalized. With an existing customer base of cannabis users, it made perfect sense for Raj to expand into selling cannabis itself. He realized that if he only sold accessories, he would eventually lose customers to shops that offered both cannabis and accessories.

After nine years of focusing on consumption accessories and accumulating nearly $10M in retained earnings, Raj raised $88.5M for the first time in 2018 and ventured into the equity markets, marking **the beginning of High Tide's journey as a publicly traded company**. With easier access to capital when compared to its peers, High Tide expanded its footprint across Canada, highlighted by the significant acquisition of its competitor Meta in 2020, which increased the number of stores from 37 to 67.

**The strategy shift that made everything change**:

Around the same time, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) began acquiring e-commerce businesses selling accessories and CBD-related products (mostly oils) with higher margin profiles, **a pivotal decision for the company**. From acquiring several brands in the U.S., such as Smoke Cartel, FABCBD, Daily High Club, DankStop, and NuLeaf Holdings, to later acquiring BlessedCBD in the UK, High Tide leveraged its market power to **enhance margins** and diversify its revenue streams.

In the summer of 2021, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) was accepted for listing on the Nasdaq, marking a significant milestone.

Later that year, a transformative decision was made: **High Tide launched a discount club model for its retail stores in October 2021**. With consolidated margins higher than any competitor due to the previously mentioned CBD-related acquisitions, High Tide could offer cannabis at remarkably low prices, **attracting loyal members and rapidly gaining market share**.

Although this discount model initially involved selling cannabis at a loss, **the move proved to be incredibly successful**. High Tide's market share increased from less than 4% to over 10% in less than three years, despite representing less than 5% of the total cannabis retail store count. **Today, the discount model program has more than 1.5M members and continues to grow each quarter**.

Being the first-of-its-kind discount model was the key differentiating factor that propelled High Tide to become the leading cannabis retailer in Canada. **No competitor could match their prices**, and Raj targeted cannabis users who consumed regularly and were highly price-sensitive.

When I first started investing in High Tide, one of its closest competitors was Fire & Flower Holdings, which ultimately went bankrupt following this price war. There are many more examples of competitors that went bankrupt following this (Four20, Tokyo Smoke, etc), showing how strong [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) has become in the sector. And the consolidation of the market in Canada is just starting.

This strategy also significantly diminished the illicit market, further strengthening High Tide’s market share.

**After capturing market share, it was time to turn profitable**:

While Raj sacrificed margins to achieve this, economies of scale and several initiatives aimed at improving margins allowed [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) to become **positive free cash flow** again in 2023 (\~8% margin as of last quarter), as well as **positive net income** in the most recent quarterly results, with a consolidated leadership position stronger than ever.

Overall, **High Tide took a calculated risk to become the leader in the country**, and it proved to be incredibly successful. This success was only possible due to the CEO's extensive experience in the sector and deep understanding of the cannabis consumer, surpassing that of any other management team.

**What's next for** [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)**?** - The best is yet to come.

While the focus on becoming FCF+ led to a notable deceleration in revenue growth, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) **is now returning to its high-growth strategy**.

Despite cannabis being legal for over five years, there's still significant market potential to capture in Canada.

A recent regulatory change in Ontario now allows one company to operate up to 150 recreational cannabis stores, doubling the previous cap of 75. This change is benefiting large retail chains like [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click). Raj Grover has outlined plans to open 20-30 stores this year (already opened 20 so far), capitalizing on the opportunity and targeting the high presence of the illicit market in the region.

Moreover, the Canadian market is experiencing significant consolidation, allowing High Tide to expand its market share organically and through acquisitions at depressed multiples. For example, High Tide recently acquired a store for 1.5x last quarter's annualized Adj. EBITDA. The CEO mentioned in the last earnings call that he's in negotiations with a sizable player to acquire additional stores, aiming to accelerate its footprint expansion and surpass this year's initial target.

Every month there are dozens of cannabis stores closing in Canada because they simply can't compete with [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click).

Over the next two years, High Tide is expected to reach a 15% market share, up from 10.9% today.

It's worth mentioning that Raj and his team have always been methodical in selecting store locations, ensuring each one yields significant returns, which is why the annual revenue per store at [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) surpasses the industry average by a wide margin.

Over the next three to five years, there's **potential to reach an annual revenue of $1B in Canada alone**.

[$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is one of the very few cannabis companies that **does NOT depend on any new legislation** to keep growing and improving its bottom-line numbers.

Ongoing developments in the U.S. might give [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) the green light to expand there.

Significant changes are on the horizon for the U.S. cannabis sector. The potential rescheduling of cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III could open doors for U.S. cannabis companies to list on major exchanges like Nasdaq or NYSE, making it easier for institutional investors to get involved. **The only reason High Tide hasn't entered the U.S. market yet is to avoid compromising its Nasdaq listing**, so this would finally open doors for the Canadian leader.

Note: For those who don’t know, U.S. cannabis companies can’t be listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq, only on the OTC markets. Since [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) only sells cannabis in Canada (and only sells CBD products or consumption accessories in the U.S.), there’s no issue. This is also one of the reasons why institutional ownership in the sector is so low.

High Tide, with its vast e-commerce base of over 3M U.S. customers and profitable operations, is poised to leverage these developments. Raj Grover’s strategic approach as a second mover allows him to avoid pitfalls and strategically open stores in key states. The company is ready to capitalize on its strong foundation and scale efficiently, aiming to secure significant market share with well-chosen locations and a clear expansion strategy.

Most U.S. operators struggle to turn a profit even with gross margins in the 40-50% range, while [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is both FCF and net income profitable with a gross margin below 30%.

While **the company doesn’t depend on the U.S. market to continue growing**, this presents an additional catalyst for its upcoming growth trajectory.

Regardless of whether this expansion happens quickly or not, these developments will attract a wave of new investors to the sector and contribute to an overall expansion in multiples.

High Tide is becoming the **Costco of Cannabis**

After the success of its free discount model, which gathered over 1.5M members in under three years, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) launched ELITE, **a paid membership with even better offers**.

The rollout began slowly, but **membership is now growing at a record pace** — 226% YoY and 38% QoQ last quarter.

It's worth noting that this growth is happening while the subscription price is being raised.

Although the absolute number is still relatively small, at 46,000, the conversion rate of regular club members to ELITE ones is getting better every quarter. You only need to make a small purchase for the membership price to pay for itself, it's exactly like [$COST](https://x.com/search?q=%24COST&src=cashtag_click).

The long-term vision is for High Tide to be the [$COST](https://x.com/search?q=%24COST&src=cashtag_click) of cannabis, **driving strong and predictable cash flows and strengthening High Tide's competitive edge**.

I believe this is one of the catalysts that will help [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) further improve bottom line margins.

Despite being a retailer with relatively low margins, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)'s gross and FCF margins (\~8% as of last quarter) have **room to grow**.

Cannabis prices in Canada are just starting to stabilize, and [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is waiting for full market stabilization before aggressively launching white labels. While many independents are closing and the market is consolidating, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) isn’t raising prices yet to avoid aiding competitors. **The long-term strategy is to leverage pricing power gradually**.

When I asked the CEO if [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)'s FCF margins are nearing a peak, the response was clear: No, **there are still many growth opportunities**. As the market consolidates and [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)'s market share increases, they anticipate further improvements in both gross and FCF margins, plus new areas to explore with scale and other initiatives.

**Valuation** - [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is the most superior cannabis business, yet the cheapest.

Retail investors in Canada alone have lost over $130B since the 2017 bubble popped, so I understand why everyone is wary of this sector.

But I have demonstrated how [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is different from the most well-known cannabis companies like [$CGC](https://x.com/search?q=%24CGC&src=cashtag_click), [$TLRY](https://x.com/search?q=%24TLRY&src=cashtag_click), [$ACB](https://x.com/search?q=%24ACB&src=cashtag_click), and others. **High Tide generates strong FCF and has a track record of consistently impressive execution**.

Most importantly, it has a highly aligned management team that cares about shareholders, which is rare in the sector.

The fact that this sector is at its peak of pessimism is what makes it possible for us to buy [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) at such a cheap valuation.

It's also worth mentioning that, unlike the other names mentioned, High Tide went public late in the game and was not part of the bubble in 2017-2018. That's why it is so underfollowed and why most people don't even know about it.Let's check the numbers.

[$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) generated CAD $22.7M in FCF over the last 12 months, so it is currently trading at 10x LTM FCF. It's worth noting that this was the first full year of FCF profitability, so this number should improve further from here.

But since most cannabis companies are not FCF-positive, let's use EV/EBITDA as a proxy.

[$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is trading at \~5x its NTM Adj. EBITDA, while the average for [$MSOS](https://x.com/search?q=%24MSOS&src=cashtag_click) is \~7-8x. Importantly, its Adj. EBITDA from these last 12 months increased 82.7% from the previous year. It's mind-blowing that it can trade at such a low multiple.

The disparity is even larger when we look at other Nasdaq-listed cannabis stocks. For instance, [$TLRY](https://x.com/search?q=%24TLRY&src=cashtag_click) is trading at almost 20x, [$ACB](https://x.com/search?q=%24ACB&src=cashtag_click) at the same, and [$CGC](https://x.com/search?q=%24CGC&src=cashtag_click) isn't even EBITDA-positive.

[$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is **the best-performing cannabis company** and one of the very few that is already generating both FCF and net income, **yet it remains the cheapest**.

Faster growth + better margins + a superior management team + a winning business model + the lowest valuation = **a complete bargain**, at least in my view.

While most investors are avoiding this sector due to the well-known companies that destroy shareholder value, I'm taking advantage of this opportunity by investing in what I consider a hidden gem.

The recent acquisition of Nova Cannabis by [$SNDL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SNDL&src=cashtag_click) at a low valuation multiple might have highlighted how undervalued [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is. Nova Cannabis was one of the few competitors to High Tide, but under [$SNDL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SNDL&src=cashtag_click)'s ownership, it has lost direction. This acquisition occurred at an EV/TTM Revenue multiple of 0.55-0.6, while [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click), a more established and superior business, was trading at 0.4x. Similarly, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)'s EV/TTM Gross Profit multiple of 1.4x contrasts sharply with Nova's 2.4x. This disparity indicates that [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is undervalued, and the market is beginning to recognize this.

2nd - Following the news that the DEA has scheduled a hearing on the marijuana rescheduling proposal after the U.S. election, causing the entire cannabis sector (including [$MSOS](https://x.com/search?q=%24MSOS&src=cashtag_click), [$CGC](https://x.com/search?q=%24CGC&src=cashtag_click), etc.) to drop significantly, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)'s performance remained strong. Despite the sector-wide double-digit decline, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) has maintained a notably higher value compared to its pre-news levels. This resilience suggests that [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is too cheap to ignore, and the market is catching on.

Before finishing, I'd like to highlight this:

[$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) has **less than 10% institutional ownership**, while over 75% of the market is owned by institutions.

**Peter Lynch often talks about this**. If you want to achieve multibagger returns, find a hidden gem before the institutions do.

Alright, it's time to talk about $PSNY (Polestar Automotive Holding). 

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY/) 

This isn't your typical meme stock play - this one's got real substance and some serious potential. Let's dive into why Polestar could be ""our"" (my) next moonshot:



1. \*\*Geely's Backing\*\*: Geely, the Chinese automotive giant, is heavily invested in Polestar. For those who don't know, Geely owns Volvo and has a stake in Daimler (Mercedes-Benz). They also hold stake in Aston Martin and Lotus. With such a powerhouse behind Polestar, their future looks bright and secure. Geely's experience and resources can significantly help scale Polestar's operations and production capabilities.



2. \*\*Strong Sales Growth\*\*: Polestar has been ramping up its sales. In 2023, they delivered 50,000 vehicles, a 125% increase from the previous year. Their goal for 2024 is to hit 80,000 vehicles. With the EV market expanding rapidly, Polestar is positioned to grab a significant share, especially with their stylish and performance-oriented models.



3. \*\*Upcoming Models\*\*: Polestar isn't resting on its laurels. They've got several new models in the pipeline:

- \*\*Polestar 3\*\*: An electric SUV designed to compete with the likes of the Tesla Model X and Audi e-tron, Porsche Macan EV, Mercedes-Benz EQE SUV, BMW iX. This segment is hot, and Polestar 3's premium build and cutting-edge tech could make it a hit. Plus, production is set for their South Carolina factory to avoid European and US tariffs.

- \*\*Polestar 4\*\*: A smaller SUV to tap into the mid-sized market, with production planned for South Korea to sidestep European and US taxes as well. Polestar 4 to compete Maserati Grecale or Genesis, Audi Q4 e-tron... 

- \*\*Polestar Precept\*\* (Polestar 5): Their flagship sedan that showcases the future of Polestar design and technology. This could be a game-changer in the luxury EV market.



  
4. \*\*Experienced Board of Directors\*\*: Polestar's board isn't just a bunch of suits. They've brought in members with serious street cred from VW, Volvo, and Skoda in China.

2024-08-07,02:52:00,pennystocks,LiveOne is the latest entertainment company stock to watch,"Hi Reddit,

I've been exploring the market lately to find another ticker for the watchlist. Normally, I focus on well-established companies like AAPL, META, MSFT, etc., but I recently found LiveOne (LVO) and it got me interested.

LiveOne, Inc. (LVO) is a media company that provides live content like comedy shows, podcasts, and music. They also offer on-demand streaming, which works similarly to Netflix or Spotify.

LiveOne has subscriptions and pay-per-view options on its platform. They’ve also recently acquired PodcastOne, which could help them grow in the entertainment world.

I’m planning to research more about this company and share updates later. This is just a quick overview.

Has anyone else looked into this company?

2024-08-02,20:10:39,pennystocks,Updates For Getting Payment in Meta Materials $3M Investor Settlement,"Hey guys, I already posted about the $3M settlement Meta Materials agreed to pay over the Torchlight Energy Resources' deal. But in case you missed it, I just found out that they are accepting late claims, so you can still file to get payment even if the deadline has passed. 



Long story short, a few years ago Meta Materials was involved in a scandal with Torchlight deal due to claims of exaggeration about their business ties and product innovation (and they were also accused of overpricing). After all of that, they got investigated by the SEC and also hit with lawsuits from investors.



The good news we got early this year was that they finally agreed to pay a $3M settlement to solve this scandal. But now, I found out that they´re accepting claims even after the deadline. So, if someone's late, you can still [check the info and file for it](https://11thestate.com/cases/meta-materials-shareholder-settlement).

2024-08-01,21:47:05,pennystocks,"The Increasing Importance of Copper in Modern Industries (TSXV : WCU, OTC : WCUFF, FRA : 7LY0)","The push for electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy infrastructure significantly boosts copper demand.  
Copper prices have risen approximately 6.54% since the beginning of 2024.  
Analysts predict copper prices could reach $11,000 per metric ton by the end of 2024, driven by increased demand and potential supply constraints.  
The stock market is facing uncertainty, with turbulent days ahead. Tesla’s recent missed earnings demonstrate how even major players can experience corrections and return to more expected levels. Some experts suggest that the market may be undergoing a shift. While the exchanges might be fluctuating, it could be wise to take a cautious approach and consider safer investments.  
However, this doesn’t mean you should only invest in assets with low potential growth. You might consider exploring small-cap but promising companies, as well as mining exploration firms with significant potential. These investments could offer opportunities for growth while still managing risk.  
**What Commodity Should You Look After?**  
While gold is here and represents one of the safest commodities in the world, another one is emerging as a top asset. It is not silver, but copper. Why?

2024-06-20,21:50:14,pennystocks,3 Penny stocks that are going to a dollar SOON (nfa tho chill) $ Stocksy's weekly DD,"Hey guys. I appreciate all the comments on the previous posts, some of the tickers suggested were actually pretty solid. KULR has been the most suggested ticker for me to check out for awhile, and here it is. As always please feel free to suggest any companies you want me to check out!



**KULR Technology Group, Inc. $KULR**

Market Cap: 66M

**Company Overview**

KULR Technology Group develops and commercializes thermal management technologies for electronics, batteries, and other components. Their products serve markets such as electric vehicles, energy storage, battery recycling transportation, cloud computing, and 5G communication devices.

**Company Highlights**

KULR had a solid 2023, with a 146% revenue increase to $9.8 million and a customer base that grew from 36 to 53. This growth shows rising demand for their tech.

  
Looking at Q1 2024, revenue was steady at $1.75 million. What stands out, though, is the 769% jump in contract services revenue to $1.13 million, indicating a strong demand for their specialized services. They more than doubled their revenue-generating customers, which is a promising sign. They did see gross margins drop to 29%, but they managed to cut SG&A expenses significantly and almost halved their R&D expenses.

One of the most compelling aspects of KULR is their partnerships. They secured a $1 million order from H55 for electric aviation applications and are working with Nanoracks for space applications. KULR is also developing next-gen battery solutions for the U.S. Army. Management often mentions that they have significant partnerships with large companies, although many are under NDAs. For example, they hinted at the potential use of their SafeCASE in Apple stores and Amazon Prime shipments, showing their broad market reach.

KULR has also launched an online marketplace for their SafeCASE and SafeSLEEVE products, approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation and accepted by UPS for battery transport. They’ve delivered power cell batteries for AI-enabled drone missions in Ukraine and customized battery solutions for the U.S. Army to enhance tactical operations.



**CEMATRIX Corporation $CTXXF $CVX.V**

Market Cap: 63M

**Company Overview**

CEMATRIX Corporation, based in Calgary, Canada, produces advanced cellular concrete products for infrastructure, industrial, energy, and commercial markets across North America. Their solutions are used for lightweight fill, insulation, and grouting applications.

**Company Highlights**

2023 was a big year for Cematrix, as it was their first year of profitability. Revenue jumped to $53.3 million from $29 million in 2022, a clear indicator that demand for their products is on the rise. Gross profit also saw a solid increase to $11.9 million, up from $2.5 million the previous year, showing their effective cost management.

In Q1 2024, the company continued to perform well. They reported $8.4 million in revenue, an improvement from $7.2 million in Q1 2023. What is important, though, is that their gross margin saw a juicy increase, reaching $2.6 million compared to just $746,000 in the same quarter last year. This shows they are scaling operations efficiently while managing costs.

  
Their cellular concrete products are particularly impressive for their high strength-to-weight ratio, resistance to hydrocarbons, and durability against freeze/thaw cycles. These features make them ideal for applications like road construction and utility insulation. For example, the resistance to hydrocarbons ensures stability even when exposed to oil or gas spills, which is crucial for long-term infrastructure projects.

The company operates through three subsidiaries: CEMATRIX (Canada) Inc, MixOnSite USA Inc, and Pacific International Grout Company. This structure allows them to manage and scale operations efficiently across North America.

Additionally, they have received approvals from multiple transportation authorities which shows their credibility. Some positive client testimonials display their effectiveness in reducing project costs and timelines.

Their Candela II Lithium Brine Project in Argentina holds an inferred resource of 457,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent, positioning them well to meet the rising lithium demand from the EV sector over the next few years.

  
The recent acquisition of the Pocitos 1 Lithium Salar Project, along with Pocitos 2, adds an inferred resource of 760,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent. The proximity to essential infrastructure enhances the project's value. Moreover, completing the environmental and social baseline report for Pocitos 1 and 2 is a significant step towards securing production permits, adding credibility to the project.

Their Blackrock South Lithium Brine Project in Nevada is another asset worth noting. Its location near the Tesla Gigafactory could open doors for future partnerships and logistical advantages.

Financially, the company raised $844,999 in April 2024 and $580,000 in May 2024 through private placements. These funds are allocated for advancing exploration at Candela II, demonstrating their commitment to developing this project.

New leadership has brought in experienced professionals. CEO Robert “Nick” Horsley, with over 19 years in finance and M&A, and CFO Daryn Gordon, a mining sector expert, bring valuable expertise to the company.

A nice bonus is that the company maintains a lean capital structure with just 23 million shares outstanding, suggesting potential for significant upside.

In terms of technology, their work at the University of Melbourne using Ekosolve™ DLE technology is impressive. They managed a 94.9% extraction efficiency and produced lithium carbonate with 99.8% purity. This breakthrough could really boost their production capabilities and set them apart.

**WESTMINSTER, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 11, 2024 /** BioLargo, Inc. (OTCQX:BLGO), a company that creates and commercializes sustainable technologies to solve tough environmental and cleantech challenges, announced that it had succeeded in manufacturing its first Cellinity^(TM) ""Liquid Sodium"" prototype battery cells. Visit [www.BioLargoEnergy.com](https://pr.report/jx) to learn more.

Cellinity is BioLargo's next-generation battery platform designed to provide safe, environmentally conscious large-format long-duration battery energy storage for applications including grid-scale storage, renewable energy storage, charging stations for electric vehicles, and a variety of other commercial and industrial applications. Cellinity is not a lithium-ion battery - rather, it uses a unique chemistry involving molten salt electrolytes that imparts substantial benefits over lithium-ion chemistry. These newly manufactured Cellinity prototype cells will now be tested and validated for the energy storage and transfer performance claims that were generated in the technology's early-stage research and development by its original inventors:

* Far greater safety - no runaway fires, no risk of explosion;
* Extremely long-lasting - no performance decrease over thousands of cycles;
* No self-discharging, no out-gassing, and no parasitic load for cooling;
* High energy density - more energy per unit of weight than lithium batteries;
* All materials can be sourced within North America without the need for rare-earth elements.

""Successfully manufacturing our first battery cells is a pivotal moment in the journey of our battery technology,"" said Dennis P. Calvert, President and CEO of BioLargo. ""The testing and validation of these cells will allow us make claims about the capacity, charge/discharge rate, and other performance characteristics that we believe differentiate our batteries in the marketplace. After testing and validation, we will manufacture full-scale prototype Cellinity battery modules in 25- and 45-kilowatt hour capacities for further testing and validation.""

He continued, ""In parallel to our ongoing development of the Cellinity battery, we're exploring various financing options that ensure we get paid for and are in control of the engineering and construction of manufacturing facilities.

Large companies take years to build, or decades, and in the meantime the stock is subject to significant fluctuations for various reasons, rates at historic highs that weigh on valuations, wars, uncertainty, delays, etc.. .

The key is to let the business grow, year after year, not by focusing on the stock, but on the continuous progress of the company's business, remaining invested for years or even decades.

To quote Buffet: ""The market is a system of redistribution of wealth, it takes away from those who don't have patience to give to those who have it""

**Why AI and 3D Modeling, and Why Now?**

The e-commerce landscape is evolving rapidly, with consumers demanding more interactive and engaging shopping experiences. This is where AI and 3D modeling technology come into play, offering a dynamic, immersive, and personalized shopping journey. The shift from 2D to 3D modeling for e-commerce is a major multi-decade transformation that is being led by AI. This transformation is  evident as major brands and companies are incorporating 3D models and AR shopping, including  [Amazon](https://nextechar.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=38d1e16b39d5ebb69b0b23747&id=40a11e024f&e=9880f900b0), [Walmart](https://nextechar.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=38d1e16b39d5ebb69b0b23747&id=4c1c0d97d2&e=9880f900b0), [CB2](https://nextechar.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=38d1e16b39d5ebb69b0b23747&id=04e406a1b5&e=9880f900b0), [IKEA](https://nextechar.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=38d1e16b39d5ebb69b0b23747&id=f0e5733840&e=9880f900b0), [Sephora](https://nextechar.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=38d1e16b39d5ebb69b0b23747&id=8992937aba&e=9880f900b0), [Target](https://nextechar.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=38d1e16b39d5ebb69b0b23747&id=2eb7dbb36f&e=9880f900b0) and more.



* **Amazon (AMZN - Worth $2 Trillion)** Amazon is leading this shift, transitioning from traditional 2D images to 3D models for all their products, setting a new standard in online retail. [Nextech3D.ai](http://Nextech3D.ai) is proud to be a preferred 3D model supplier for Amazon, already creating thousands of 3D models per month and scaling up.

**The Power of 3D Models in E-Commerce**

3D models in e-commerce are not just visually appealing; they are revolutionary. They enable customers to visualize products in high detail from every angle, significantly enhancing decision-making confidence. This shift leads to higher conversion rates, as customers are more likely to purchase when they can thoroughly explore a product. Moreover, 3D visualization reduces returns, as buyers have a clearer expectation of what they are purchasing, thus saving costs and improving customer satisfaction. Additionally, interactive 3D models increase customer engagement, keeping them on your site longer, which directly correlates with increased sales.

**A Timely Investment Opportunity**

The timing for investing in AI and 3D modeling technology could not be more opportune. As online shopping continues to grow, the demand for more immersive and interactive experiences is skyrocketing. Businesses adopting 3D models are setting new benchmarks for customer engagement and satisfaction. By investing in [Nextech3D.ai](http://Nextech3D.ai), you are not merely keeping pace; you are positioning yourself at the forefront of an e-commerce revolution.

**Why Nextech3D.ai?**

Nextech3D.ai stands at the forefront of this mega-trend, leading the massive shift from static 2D images to immersive 3D experiences. Our AI-powered 3D modeling technology creates photo-realistic 4K 3D models that cater to major e-commerce platforms like Amazon. With years of expertise and a portfolio of high-profile clients including Amazon, P&G, Kohls, Miele and others - Nextech3D.ai is transforming online shopping into an interactive adventure.

**9 characteristics you need to look for when investing in a company :**

**1) The world's largest companies sell products or services used in everyday life.**

The e-commerce market is constantly growing and it is expected to exceed $7 trillion by 2025. This is why it is essential for online retailers to not only keep up with emerging trends, but also keep up with the times by adopting innovative strategies such as switching from obsolete 2D models to current 3D models. The shift to 3D objects marks the beginning of a new paradigm, destined to change the world of online and retail shopping, with the introduction of AR (powered by giants such as Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Meta and others)

[Nextech3d.ai](http://Nextech3d.ai) collaborates with the largest retailers in many parts of the world and the demand for its 3D models is constantly growing.

**2 ) The world's largest companies have global reach and appeal for their product and services**

A product that offers its services only in a certain region or country doesn't have the same kind of long-term growth potential as a truly global product. Nextech3d, together with its subsidiaries, operates in several countries around the world, making its reach and interest in what it offers in high demand. Arway's last few months' contracts (with many pilots underway) and contracts secured by [Nextech3d.ai](http://Nextech3d.ai) (more about to roll out this month) make Nextechar a company with global reach

3) The largest companies in the world are led by a visionary leader in the market in which he operates

I trust that we will have many more validations and contracts in the months to come, as announced in the pr

**6) Make sure the CEO holds a stake in the company (10-20%) as evidence of his interest in shareholders, being heavily invested himself**

EVAN GAPPELBERG owns over 10%

**7) The largest companies in the world have unlimited growth potential in the space in which they operate .**

**8) The world's largest companies dominate the competition.**

Nextech3d.ai is slowly expanding its global reach with ongoing contracts in more parts of the world. Reducing the costs of its models and increasing productivity will allow nextech3d.ai to continue to scale and gain market share as the industry continues to grow and evolve

**9) The largest companies in the world are constantly evolving thanks to the innovation of their teams**

Very rarely will you find a company that meets all of these criteria, but any good long-term winner (5 years or more) will have most of these characteristics.

When you can buy these types of companies at fair (or very low in this case) prices, you are almost guaranteed to reap the benefits in the long term. The profit is made at the moment of purchase, exploiting the irrationality of the market, not letting emotions take over rationality.

2024-05-09,17:37:27,pennystocks,"Tesla announced firing of all its Supercharger team, slowing charging stations installements. The smallcaps to be benefited by this big news  are few.","Tesla lead the first quarter installements with 75% market share but Elon Musk fired all the Supercharger team and halted the further expansion.

 A huge gap is created while the competitors are fast growing, but mostly indebted mid-caps with losses, so they will need funds, aka dilution to cover any demand. Also, due to restrictions like BABAA Act, the imports can't be used.  
In the field of smallcaps, the only debt-free with cash in hand and 2024 expected profitability is Pioneer Power, PPSI. In contrast with the other stocks, this one trades at a P/S far below 1 and a very low PEG. Its stock price is near its lows for two reasons, first because its Q4/2023 were less good than expected and secontly because investors are in wait&see mode until the Q1/2024 results, which, according to the analysts will be good in terms of revenues more than $10M and EPS of $0.05. 

  
Other similar stocks can't be mentioned here as their revenues are those of a microcap but their valuations exeed the $300M of a smallcap, because the charging industry is so promising and already fast growing. ",TSLA,Tesla

* **Company overview:**
   * Allego NV (based in The Netherlands) provides and operates EV charging locations throughout Europe. They have all kinds of chargers, ranging from slow charging to ultrafast, but their focus is fast charging (50 - 125 KW) on parking lots. They operate 34.000+ charging points throughout Europe.
* **The stock**
   * is undervalued. In the US sentiment for EV-related stocks is very bad. Most EV stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. This resulted in a big sell-off of anything related EV. But this company is not on the US market. It's a European company and the European market is totally different.
* Sales
   * In Europe EV sales are still growing, helped by legislation. Although consumers are still reluctant to buy one, big organisations are all switching to EVs. Most big companies or government organisations have strict CO2 reduction goals and switching to EVs is a quick win.
* The company
   * started in The Netherlands, which has been one of the front-runners in EV adoption. Bigger countries, such as France and Germany were slower to adopt EVs, but are catching up rapidly (again: helped by legislation). In these countries there's a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. Only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time, so Allego is very quickly winning contracts all over Europe. Their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed Allego to grow FAST at the moment. There's not a lot of competition in Europe: some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand-alone locations next to the major roads (such as FastNed, Ionity or Tesla).
* Financially
   * Third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2% to €28.6 million, compared to €22.3 million in the prior year period.
   * Third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0% to €22.0 million, compared to €14.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022.
   * Gross profit increased to €5.4 million compared to €(4.6) million in the prior-year-period; gross margin during the quarter was 18.9%.
   * Third quarter 2023 net loss was €(43.1) million, compared to €(22.1) million in the prior-year period; Operational EBITDA was €2.6 million reflecting higher charging revenue and improved charging gross margin compared to the prior-year period loss of €(3.1) million.
   * Allego recently signed two power purchase agreements (PPAs) totaling 100 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy per year with Energy Solutions Group, the largest independent green energy producer in the Benelux region, with renewable energy sourced from a solar park that is expected to be operational in January 2024, and a wind farm that is expected to be completed in January 2025.

We believe an individual's right to privacy should not end the moment they click “send”, and that we all deserve the same right to privacy online that we enjoy in our own living rooms. Our flagship product, the DatChat Messenger & Private Social Network, is a privacy platform and mobile application that provides users the ability to communicate and share with the privacy and protection they deserve.

Our platform allows users to exercise control over their messages and posts, even after they are sent. Through our application, users can delete messages that they send on their own device and the recipients device as well. There is no set time limit within which they must exercise this choice. A user can elect at any time to delete a message previously sent to a recipients device. In addition, users can delete entire conversations at any time, making it like the conversation never even happened. Additionally, our application includes a screenshot protection system, which makes it virtually impossible for the recipient to screenshot a message or picture before it gets destroyed.

2024-04-18,22:56:32,pennystocks,dynaCERT (TSXV: $DYA) on the Brink of Launching Carbon Credits,"dynaCERT (TSXV: $DYA), a global leader in carbon emission reduction technology, is on the verge of getting its Verra VCS certification. This certification is a big deal because it will allow $DYA to participate in global carbon credit trading, and it underscores the company’s commitment to clean technology. 

dynaCERT recognizes the potential of carbon credits as a strategic asset. By issuing carbon credits to end-users, $DYA will be able to encourage businesses to adopt its emission reduction technologies by offering real incentives. 

**How Carbon Credits Work:**  

Carbon credits are generated by projects that have avoided or removed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Basically, each credit represents one less tonne of carbon dioxide, or another greenhouse gas equivalent, (CO2e) in the atmosphere. 

A prime example illustrating the economic benefits of carbon credits is Tesla ($TSLA), who has strategically leveraged these credits as part of its business model. Recently, $TSLA announced record high sales from carbon credits sales at $1.79B. 

**dynaCERT ($DYA) Carbon Credit Update:** 

Looking back at dynaCERT - $DYA secured Verra VCS Methodology approval in 2021 and received a final Assessment Report from Earhood in November 2023, confirming its compliance with Verra's standards.  

Currently, $DYA is in the final stages of obtaining VCS certification, and once the certification is received, the company plans to action some of its exciting plans. 

$DYA plans to use its proprietary HydraLytica™ Telematics platform to facilitate the conversion of CO2 emissions. HydraLytica™ was basically created to monitor fuel consumption to calculate GHG emissions savings. And the best part is that the company plans to share some of the tangible benefits of carbon credits with its end-users. 

In addition, the recent adoption of stricter CO2 emission targets for trucks and buses in the EU perfectly aligns with dynaCERT's goals, further validating the company's mission.  

* The European Parliament has passed new regulations aimed at enforcing more rigorous CO2 reduction targets for heavy-duty vehicles. These targets set ambitious goals for significant emission reductions by 2030 and mandate that urban buses achieve zero emissions by 2035. 

Stayed tuned for updates on dynaCERT's journey towards Verra VCS certification and its impact on the global carbon credit market.

2024-04-17,15:22:55,pennystocks,Best Risk-to Reward Set Up This Week: $ONEI Testing its 2024 Trendline,"Good morning, everyone! I hope your trading has been going well so far this week! I was waiting for this correction at the beginning of this week, and I got exactly what I was looking for with $ONEI. With its current price just above the trendline and still strong fundamentals with its partnership with Microsoft, the likelihood of it breaking both support levels is pretty slim. Below is exactly what I am looking at. Let's make some bread!  
**Strategy**: Long Position

**Entry Target**: A buy entry would be as close to the trend line as possible, slightly above $0.70, which is reinforced by the 200-day moving average. This dual support region could act as a springboard for price appreciation.

**Stop-Loss**: A tight stop-loss could be placed just below the trend line and 200-day moving average, around $0.65, to minimize risk. This assumes the 200-day moving average is currently at $0.5024 and rising, and the trend line is also ascending, as indicated.

**Exit Target**: The profit target can be set by measuring the distance from the trend line near the recent peak around $1.10. This setup provides a more than 3:1 risk-to-reward ratio, with potential to adjust the targets if the price shows strong bullish momentum.

2024-04-15,15:27:18,pennystocks,OTC Pick of the Day - Partnering w/ Microsoft! Lots of Potential," Morning all! Today I am going over my TOP OTC pick of the moment - ONEI. $ONEI (OneMeta) has recently struck a deal with Microsoft ($MSFT)!! & I believe we could see some substantial gains on this ticker. Communicated disclaimer, nfa.

### Overview

OneMeta, Inc. specializes in developing advanced AI solutions that facilitate real-time linguistic translation and transcription across over 150 languages, boasting a commendable 95% accuracy rate.

The stock has experienced a quadruple surge, escalating by 243.5% over the last four months, signaling robust investor confidence and market receptivity.

### Trade Opportunity

We first saw this one at $0.85 and we saw slight gains up to about $0.88 - My target, though, is now sitting at the $0.95 - $1.05 area! I will show a chart, as well.

[1D Chart](https://preview.redd.it/kmpaiy609nuc1.png?width=3161&format=png&auto=webp&s=45664509a072f0357dedcb71479d8956bb9ae138)

Things to note - 

1. Watch for VOLUME (above 10k in volume early in the day could mean we have a good day ahead of us)
2. $1.20 is not an unreasonable price target for this ticker!
3. We are sitting in a great supply zone & have short sellers that will need to cover soon (according to my interpretation of the level 2 data and short interest data)

### Interesting Info

OneMeta has recently expanded its market presence significantly:

* **Sales Teams Engagement**: Collaboration with 600+ Microsoft Teams sales teams.
* **Language Capabilities**: Supports communications in 150 languages, reaching a diverse global audience.
* **Education and Healthcare Initiatives**: Pilots in schools and partnerships in healthcare to leverage Verbum for critical communication needs.

### Reasons to Consider ONEI

1. **Innovative Technology**: OneMeta's proprietary AI and NLP technologies offer near-instantaneous translation and transcription, outperforming giants like Google Translate.
2. **Strategic Partnerships**: The integration with Microsoft Teams and the Microsoft IP Co-Sell Ready status not only extend its market reach but also enhance its product credibility.
3. **Expanding Market Reach**: With initiatives across education and healthcare, OneMeta is positioned to capture significant market segments that are increasingly reliant on effective multilingual communication.
4. **Financial Growth Potential**: The impressive stock price rally and low market cap suggest a potential growth trajectory that may appeal to investors looking for high returns in technology equity.
5. **Compliance and Security**: Adherence to rigorous security standards including SOC 1 and SOC 2, ensuring the product meets enterprise-level compliance demands.

So, in conclusion - this is one of the more fundamentally sound OTCs that I have ran into. I believe they are under-hyped and under-valued! Share your thoughts below!

2024-04-15,03:20:14,pennystocks,Waiting For One-Meta ($ONEI) Partnership With Microsoft,"One-Meta has been hinting at a partnership with Microsoft for multiple months, with continued news releases mentioning these two companies teaming up. Last month, $ONEI hit a high of $1.39 before pulling back all the way to .57. With the price currently sitting at .87, this stock is still in indecision. It is still above the trendline and the 200, which is bullish.

 I expect a minor correction tomorrow morning across the market due to the Iran and Israel conflict. I will be trying to snag cheap shares of One-Meta because if the news does come out this stock…it might just fly to its biggest resistance at $2. This setup is a perfect example of buying a rumor and selling the news. I might be screwed if there is no news, but the puzzle pieces and hints are there.

However, it surpassed expectations, blew through all resistances, and nearly hit the $2 mark before getting rejected. If you are still in this trade, please make sure to take profits! 

With the risk-to-reward no longer in my favor, I am now looking at $ONEI. The company has been making significant strides, particularly with its recent announcement of expanding its presence on Microsoft’s corporate websites (the link to the article is in the sources below). Despite the volatility in April, the stock has shown resilience, maintaining an upward trend. I provide the chart below if interested!

**Target Price:** $1.10 - $1.20 \~ 35% from its current price

**Stop Loss:** Below either the trendline or the 200 SMA

*Support Levels:*

**Primary Support (Trend Line):** The ascending blue trend line currently sits at around $0.75. Given the recent price action above this line, this is the first level of major support.

**Secondary Support:** 200 SMA - The price must be above this moving average for this stock to remain bullish

*Resistance Levels:*

**Prior Highs:** The recent swing highs around $0.90 and $1.00 (assuming round numbers based on previous local peaks) are the next resistance levels.

2024-04-10,09:02:39,pennystocks,Market scale of the digital economy is expanding(NASDAQ: WIMI)," 

In recent years, the scale of digital economy has been expanding, and its competitiveness and influence have been steadily improving. Digital economy has become a new engine of global economic development. On the one hand, the digital economy will fully enable the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, and use the integrated application of digital technologies to enable the innovation of traditional industries, promote the breakthrough of major technologies and equipment, and realize the independence of core technologies.  
On the other hand, industry is an important carrier for the development of digital economy. Digital economy enables the development of industries and builds a modern industrial system with international competitiveness. Digital economy with digital platform strengthens the upstream and downstream cooperation of the traditional industrial chain, promotes the competitiveness of the industrial chain, and realizes the middle and high end of the value chain.

**Critical period of digital economy development**  
With the in-depth development of digital economy, it grasps the opportunity of the integration of digital economy and real economy, innovates the connotation and form of new production relations, and provides new ideas for the innovative development of digital economy. The digital economy is opening up entirely new possibilities, leading the public into an unprecedented new era.  
At the same time, at this critical stage, the proposal of new quality productivity will promote the deep integration of artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain and cloud computing with all links of traditional industries, build a new ecology of intelligent manufacturing industry, and constantly provide momentum support for the development of digital economy.

**WiMi for high-quality development**  
Development of digital economy has become the theme of The Times, we have learned, under this background, WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) as a digital infrastructure comprehensive solution provider, is committed to strengthen scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation depth fusion, for the industry development with “intelligent” wings, installed “digital” engine, to digital industry demonstration highlands. At present, WiMi is at the forefront of this revolution. It not only shows its profound heritage and technical strength in the industry, but also highlights its active role in promoting the development of the digital economy.  
Innovating digital scenarios and promoting the application of digital economy, WiMi gives full play to its technological advantages in the field of science and technology, and continues to create a number of benchmark cases of the digital industry. WiMi has laid out artificial intelligence early, promoted 5G, AR, etc., with outstanding advantages in cutting-edge technology segments, and increasingly enhanced basic support. At the same time, it has further built computing power industrial cluster and multi-modal construction of artificial intelligence, vigorously developed AIGC industry, accelerated the development of meta-universe, attracted a large number of upstream and downstream enterprises of the industrial chain to carry out cooperation, and jointly discussed the opportunities of digital economy.  
It is worth mentioning that in order to further explore the new economy industry potential, activate the high quality development of new kinetic energy, in the new quality productivity, WiMi look global strategic emerging industries and industries in the future, to “number” for “new”, looking for new economic growth point, prospective layout develop green economy, platform economy, to promote the development of digital economy quality provide power. I believe that in the future, WiMi will further integrate the development of the digital economy and the real economy, which will surely promote the cultivation and development of new quality productive forces, so that more people can share the new fruits of digital development.

**To sum up**  
Digital economy has become an important starting point for the development of new quality productive forces. The country has issued a number of policies to support the cultivation of digital ecological environment, accelerate the integration of innovation chain and industrial chain, so as to promote high-quality economic and social development. As the 2024 government work report pointed out that “vigorously promote the construction of a modern industrial system, accelerate the development of new quality productive forces”, and “further promote the innovative development of the digital economy”.  
, Of course, to strive to build national innovation highland, speed up the innovation chain, industrial chain depth fusion, enterprises need around the main scene in the digital economy development, adjust measures to local conditions to develop emerging digital industry, focusing on big data, artificial intelligence, algorithm, strengthen the key digital technology scenarios integrated application, to through “whole industry” chain, bring scale driving effect on economic development.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."
2024-04-08,02:22:20,pennystocks,$FSRN Fisker Full Sending Tomorrow!,"    
Fisker is making notable strides in the electric vehicle (EV) sector, differentiating itself with unique strategies and competitive pricing, reminiscent of its journey from the days of the Fisker Karma. The company is setting a robust trajectory similar to emerging players like Lucid and Rivian, aiming to disrupt the market with aggressive price reductions, especially on its 2023 Fisker Ocean models, signaling an ambitious inventory strategy. 

Noteworthy is Fisker's financial restructuring under the advisory of Deutsche Bank AG and PJT Partners. This move is pivotal, mirroring PJT Partners' successful financial strategizing with Carvana, which notably rebounded in stock value following their intervention.

Moreover, Fisker's financial health is comparatively robust, with its debt significantly lower than competitors, demonstrating efficient capital utilization. This is underscored by a recent investment surge from Vanguard Group Inc., which acquired a substantial share in Fisker, signaling strong market confidence.

The Fisker Ocean stands out for its affordability, further accentuated by recent price cuts, presenting a viable alternative to higher-priced competitors like Tesla. Fisker's strategic initiatives, including potential reverse splits to meet NYSE standards, signal a determined path toward growth, reminiscent of Carvana's resurgence post-PJT Partners' engagement. As an investor and observer, Fisker's trajectory, bolstered by strategic partnerships and financial prudence, presents a compelling case for its future in the EV market. Let's continue this discussion constructively and share insights in the comments below.

TLDR: Fisker is advancing in the EV market with aggressive pricing and unique strategies, such as price cuts to US/CANADA/EU Inventory, hinting at a bright future akin to its peers like Lucid and Rivian. With strategic financial restructuring advised by Deutsche Bank AG and PJT Partners, and a significant investment from Vanguard Group Inc., Fisker shows strong financial health and market confidence. The affordability and strategic pricing of the Fisker Ocean, alongside initiatives like potential reverse splits, underscore Fisker's growth potential, drawing parallels to Carvana's recovery guided by PJT Partners. Fisker is setting a course for significant advancement in the EV industry.

2024-04-07,07:09:47,pennystocks,Volatility index up a lot this past week 😳,"With the VIX up 21% since January and roughly 17% just in the past week, how concerned are you?

Iran and Russia tensions, U.S. election drama, maybe some stock market froth, the VIX/oil jumping a lot this year, Tesla and Apple unable to hold gains, etc…all a bit unnerving to say the least! ",TSLA,Tesla
2024-04-06,19:04:15,pennystocks,Fisker Inc. My Bullish Thesis $FSRN,"Fisker has long been shunned in the EV industry, known for the Fisker Karma, which since has been become a meme at this point, reminds me of how Lucid is trying to market its cars, and is in the infancy stages of a car company.

Fisker is poised to break the stagnant EV market, they already have begun aggressive price cuts to the $500 million dollars of finished goods inventory, that being 2023 Fisker Oceans. The company also has future plans coming through the pipeline to compete with the likes of Rivian, being the Fisker Alaska, competing with Tesla's roadster? (still waiting for production?) being the Fisker Ronin, and a more affordable smaller sized EV for city living being the Fisker Pear.

The company is being evaluated currently and being financially restructured by the likes of  Deutsche Bank AG and PJT Partners, which will help Fisker restructure its current debt, which only sits at -1.5 Billion currently, competitors like Rivian's debt is currently at -18.6 Billion, Lucid's debt is -10.2 Billion, Nio's debt is -10.1 Billion, and even the likes of Xpeng being -4.7 billion, Polestar -4.2 Billion, and Mullen automotive for the meme, their debt is -1.9 Billion, and their cars look like Chevy express vans from 2005. Anyways, the point here is that Fisker is very efficient at using capital given to them, unlike their ""competitors"". This is just one reason as to why I am so excited to hold this stock and will continue to in the near and long future.

The Fisker Ocean, priced at $47,000 even after delivery and taxes is much more affordable than a Tesla model Y, currently Fisker is price cutting Fisker Oceans to as low as $24,999, and its just one reason as to why I will continue to hold the stock I own, please check out my previous post in this sub and read the comments if you would like more DD like this, currently I am waiting for my power to be turned on, dealing with the fallout of Winter Storm Cora, and it has been 5 days since my power went out. I will be more than happy to explain more of my bullish thesis on Fisker and why I am so adamant about this stock rising, I believe a reverse split is in order regarding Fisker, which will bring it back to the NYSE's minimum requirements as currently it is on the pink sheets OTC market. If you have the option or means to purchase this stock anytime soon, I truly believe that this is the next ""Tesla"". Please keep discussion in the comments nice and supporting my case, I do not want unnecessary flame wars in the comments. Thank you for reading if you made it this far, please drop some hearts in the comments, any color!!! 🧡🤍💙",TSLA,Tesla
2024-04-06,18:40:38,pennystocks,Why I’m Betting on KULR,"With my excitement on some of the KULR (NYSE American: KULR) posts and the chat, I keep getting private DMs about why I’m into them. So here’s my DD after reviewing the last few months of news. 

PROS: 

4/2/24: Secure $1M+ contract with H55, the technological spinoff of Solar Impulse (the first electric airplane to fly around the world propelled by only solar energy).

3/27/24: Retired all outstanding Yorkville debt.

3/26/24: Secure a six figure deal with Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) to develop PCM heat sinks for precision missile electronics. This comes on the heels of Lockheed’s own $219m contact with the U.S. Army for missiles.

3/21/24: Received an additional purchase order from the U.S. Army, increasing their total contract value to $1.81M.

3/19/24: Lands initial testing order with a leading U.S. automaker  

3/14/24: Announces a strategic contract exceeding $865,000 with Nanorocks (now part of Voyager Space’s Exploration Segment) and aims to enhance Voyager’s CubeSat applications.

3/12/24: Secured new special permits from US DoT

2/21/24: Announced groundbreaking developmental program that will play a pivotal role in battery tech to be deployed on space missions scheduled for 2024 and beyond.

1/17/24: Secures exclusive global rights to NASA’s battery safety tech to service world’s largest OEM users. When this was announced the article also highlighted these aspects of KULR’s business servings:

* A top global automaker for next generation EV battery safety and testing solutions

* One of the world’s largest private space exploration companies for enhanced battery safety solutions

* A top-5 American electric truck manufacturer to design and develop safer next-gen batteries

* A top-5 global manufacturer in the electric vertical take-off and landing sector for safe battery testing solutions

* Testing lithium-ion cells in battery packs designed for the Artemis Space Program

* And many other customers across all battery chemistries including silicon anode, solid state, nickel manganese cobalt (NMC), and lithium iron phosphate (LFP).

**unconfirmed speculation: a user on /KULR rummaged through KULR’s Twitter page and the only U.S. automaker they claimed to find was Tesla. If Tesla proves true then it would not be a stretch to believe Space-X is included the private sector’s mentioned above.

**my personal speculation with their participation in the Artemis program is that other Artemis awardees like Intuitive Machines (NASDAQ: LUNR), Lunar Outpost, Venturi Astrolab, 3tc will have to use the NASA/KULR tech when such tech would be required.

CONS (some with remedies already taken):

4/1/24: KULR filed a notice of late filing for the yearly report but is expected to report within the grace period. Amended: KULR will release their 4th quarter and year end earnings call (12/31/24) on 4/12/24.

2/16/24: Receives Non-Compliance Notice from NYSE American for a 30 day trading average <.2/share. Amended 3/8/24 KULR receives acceptance of compliance plan by NYSE. (And let’s face it, numbers have 🚀🚀 well over .2 this past month.)

1/9/24: Reduces work force by 15% in effort to break even in 2nd quarter 2024. 
*personally I don’t like the layoff/restructuring for the people perspective, but from the corporate perspective i begrudgingly understand.

Keep in mind all this news above is for the current quarter and for the most part will not reflect on the previous quarter/year financials that are due out 4/12.  

All of these  promising developments in the public and private sectors touching on DOD, DOT, aerospace, EV, etc with highly regarded companies is why I’m betting on high futures here. So, no more need to inbox me on why I think their future looks good on a long hold. This is my opinion alone, and like any other stock, do your own DD. Take the bets you can afford. 

***To the other question I get, it is not too late to buy in as I see this skyrocketing past $1+ and more this year with their developing professional relationships.

* Nikola today announced it will report its first quarter ended March 31, 2024 financial results and business updates on Tuesday, May 7, 2024. On that day, Nikola's management will hold a conference call and webcast at 10:30 a.m. ET (7:30 a.m. PT) to review and discuss the company's business and outlook.
* Today, Nikola stock jumped by as much as nearly 16% on news that it produced 43 of the Class 8 FCEVs and sold 40 of them to wholesalers destined for end customers in the first quarter. Those deliveries were on top of the 35 trucks shipped in the fourth quarter of 2023 in its first quarterly production period.
* Nikola surpassed estimates for deliveries of its hydrogen big rigs in the first quarter, a sign it was making progress in its pivot to the technology from battery electric trucks after some missteps that battered its share price.
* Nikola in February set a target to deliver as many as 350 hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric trucks in 2024 and said it had delivered 35 units in the fourth quarter.
* ""We are on track for a successful 2024 by continuing the momentum set in 2023,"" said Nikola CEO Steve Girsky. ""It's about more than just setting goals. It's about following through on our commitments. This includes not only the production and sale of our hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks but also the start of returns for our battery-electric trucks to customers.""
* **Forbes article**
* *While its current sales volume is modest, delivering just 154 hydrogen and battery trucks since last year, Nikola appears to be far outselling Tesla in the electric truck market.Elon Musk said in late 2022, when the Tesla Semi presumably went into production, that deliveries would ramp up throughout 2023 with a target of delivering 50,000 this year. However, the company hasn’t shared any delivery figures for it since then. The truck wasn’t referenced in first-quarter delivery figures released this week, and Tesla also didn’t include Semi figures in its quarterly financial filings last year. The model was listed as still being in “pilot production” in Tesla’s annual report filed early this year, with no details.Notably, the Tesla Semi also isn’t registered among the trucks qualifying for California’s clean truck rebates — the nation’s most generous — suggesting it’s not being sold in the market where demand for electric commercial vehicles is highest. So far, the only known users of the Tesla Semi are Frito-Lay and Pepsi, which have about 100 trucks hauling chips and soda in California.Tesla didn’t respond to a request for details on how many Semis it’s shipped so far and when it would register the truck for California incentives.*

&#x200B;

* **Company overview:**  

   * Allego NV (based in The Netherlands) provides and operates EV charging locations throughout Europe. They have all kinds of chargers, ranging from slow charging to ultrafast, but their focus is fast charging (50 - 125 KW) on parking lots. They operate 34.000+ charging points throughout Europe.
* **The stock**  

   * is undervalued. In the US sentiment for EV-related stocks is very bad. Most EV stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. This resulted in a big sell-off of anything related EV. But this company is not on the US market. It's a European company and the European market is totally different.
* Sales  

   * In Europe EV sales are still growing, helped by legislation. Although consumers are still reluctant to buy one, big organisations are all switching to EVs. Most big companies or government organisations have strict CO2 reduction goals and switching to EVs is a quick win.
* The company  

   * started in The Netherlands, which has been one of the front-runners in EV adoption. Bigger countries, such as France and Germany were slower to adopt EVs, but are catching up rapidly (again: helped by legislation). In these countries there's a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. Only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time, so Allego is very quickly winning contracts all over Europe. Their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed Allego to grow FAST at the moment. There's not a lot of competition in Europe: some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand-alone locations next to the major roads (such as FastNed, Ionity or Tesla).
* Financially  

   * Third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2% to €28.6 million, compared to €22.3 million in the prior year period.
   * Third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0% to €22.0 million, compared to €14.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022.
   * Gross profit increased to €5.4 million compared to €(4.6) million in the prior-year-period; gross margin during the quarter was 18.9%.
   * Third quarter 2023 net loss was €(43.1) million, compared to €(22.1) million in the prior-year period; Operational EBITDA was €2.6 million reflecting higher charging revenue and improved charging gross margin compared to the prior-year period loss of €(3.1) million.
   * Allego recently signed two power purchase agreements (PPAs) totaling 100 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy per year with Energy Solutions Group, the largest independent green energy producer in the Benelux region, with renewable energy sourced from a solar park that is expected to be operational in January 2024, and a wind farm that is expected to be completed in January 2025.
   * In October, Allego recorded over 1 million sessions per month across its network.
* **All in all:**  

   * Allego is in pole position to becoming the biggest EV charging provider in Europe. They have a smart strategy in place and lack competition. They are on their way to stopping the cash burn in 2024 and turning profitable in 2025. Some macro-economic developments are helping them grow, such as strict European legislation. Other macro-economic developments may be unpredictable, such as energy prices or energy net congestion. The stock price has fallen because of negative sentiment surrounding electric vehicles and this provides an excellent buying opportunity!

* **Company overview:**
   * Allego NV (based in The Netherlands) provides and operates EV charging locations throughout Europe. They have all kinds of chargers, ranging from slow charging to ultrafast, but their focus is fast charging (50 - 125 KW) on parking lots. They operate 34.000+ charging points throughout Europe.
* **The stock**
   * is undervalued. In the US sentiment for EV-related stocks is very bad. Most EV stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. This resulted in a big sell-off of anything related EV. But this company is not on the US market. It's a European company and the European market is totally different.
* Sales
   * In Europe EV sales are still growing, helped by legislation. Although consumers are still reluctant to buy one, big organisations are all switching to EVs. Most big companies or government organisations have strict CO2 reduction goals and switching to EVs is a quick win.
* The company
   * started in The Netherlands, which has been one of the front-runners in EV adoption. Bigger countries, such as France and Germany were slower to adopt EVs, but are catching up rapidly (again: helped by legislation). In these countries there's a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. Only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time, so Allego is very quickly winning contracts all over Europe. Their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed Allego to grow FAST at the moment. There's not a lot of competition in Europe: some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand-alone locations next to the major roads (such as FastNed, Ionity or Tesla).
* Financially
   * Third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2% to €28.6 million, compared to €22.3 million in the prior year period.
   * Third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0% to €22.0 million, compared to €14.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022.

2024-03-22,11:34:01,pennystocks,$ALLG: European EV charging services provider with great potential,"Hi everyone,

Yesterday Allego NV ($ALLG) closed at $0.85 coming from a low of $0.59 just a couple of days ago. I bought some shares yesterday, because I believe it will climb above $1 in the short term and will move higher in the long term. Here's why: 

**Company overview:** Allego NV (based in The Netherlands) provides and operates EV charging locations throughout Europe. They have all kinds of chargers, ranging from slow charging to ultrafast, but their focus is fast charging (50 - 125 KW) on parking lots. They operate 34.000+ charging points throughout Europe. 

\- The stock is undervalued. In the US sentiment for EV-related stocks is very bad. Most EV stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. This resulted in a big sell-off of anything related EV. But this company is not on the US market. It's a European company and the European market is totally different. 

\- In Europe EV sales are still growing, helped by legislation. Although consumers are still reluctant to buy one, big organisations are all switching to EVs. Most big companies or government organisations have strict CO2 reduction goals and switching to EVs is a quick win. These organisations have to install chargers on their parking lots and Allego has been providing these since 2013. These big organisations will negotiate pricing agreements on the energy prices, so the margins will be thin. But the big advantage is: the charging needs on these parking lots are predictable and continuous. This was their main focus during the starting years of the company and a smart strategy: they were able to build revenue and gain expertise, with predictable income in a time when private EV ownership was still low. 

**In short:** Allego has a baseline steady stream of predictable revenue from partnerships with big (governmental) organisations by providing charging solutions for their own fleet of cars.

\- Their focus in the last 3 years has been to partner with big companies to build charging stations on their parking lots to offer charging solutions to the public. They landed some BIG contracts (for example Radisson hotel group, Van der Valk hotel group, Casino Hypermarché (French supermarkets), Burger Kings Europe). They are slowly shifting their strategy to offering public charging stations, which make sense in 2024 when EV ownership is getting higher and still increasing in Europe. On these public charging stations, the charging hours and predictability will be lower, but margins will be higher. 

**In short:** Allego has shifted very successfully to offering public charging locations on parking lots of businesses, such as supermarkets, restaurants and hotels. 

\- The company started in The Netherlands, which has been one of the front-runners in EV adoption. Bigger countries, such as France and Germany were slower to adopt EVs, but are catching up rapidly (again: helped by legislation). In these countries there's a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. Only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time, so Allego is very quickly winning contracts all over Europe. Their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed Allego to grow FAST at the moment. There's not a lot of competition in Europe: some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand-alone locations next to the major roads (such as FastNed, Ionity or Tesla). 

**In short:** Allego is extremely well positioned to deploy new charging locations throughout Europe at a rapid pace, since there is hardly any real competitor in Europe that does what they do. 

\- Financially Allego is in a reasonabe position. Their 2023 revenue is up 28% from 2022 and is expected to grow another 30% in 2024. They are about to publish their full year results, but I expect the total revenue to be around €185m in 2023 (€0.69 per share). Their gross margins are pretty good and their operational EBITDA will be around €35m (€0.13 per share). Their total debt is €320m, which is obviously quite high and their interest payments are too high compared to their revenue. But in 2023 they made several big investments and they landed some big contracts in exchange for equity. Also their cash flow is improving, so I expect them to continue into 2024 without increasing their debt. This will be a crucial turning point in their way towards profitability. 

**In short:** Allego has strong revenues and margins with good growth numbers. Their debt is high and they should be careful not to increase it, but they already made big investments in 2023 that should pay off in 2024. 

**All in all:** Allego is in pole position to becoming the biggest EV charging provider in Europe. They have a smart strategy in place and lack competition. They are on their way to stopping the cash burn in 2024 and turning profitable in 2025. Some macro-economic developments are helping them grow, such as strict European legislation. Other macro-economic developments may be unpredictable, such as energy prices or energy net congestion. The stock price has fallen because of negative sentiment surrounding electric vehicles and this provides an excellent buying opportunity! Get yourself some of these shares in the $0.80 - $0.85 price range! On their 2023 full year results I think they will climb to $1 (+20%).

* **Prices for nickel are down around 30% because of oversupply from Indonesia.**
* **The automobile industry could play a key role in helping develop nickel deposits in North America.**

*Editor’s note: This story has been updated to clarify the Alaska Energy Metals CEO’s comments on automotive companies.*

Nickel prices are tanking and that’s hurting companies’ exploration efforts, according to **Alaska Energy Metals** **AKEMF** CEO **Greg Beischer**.

""It makes it harder to raise capital because the commodity is out of favor in investors' eyes,"" Beischer told Benzinga.

With a low stock price, he added, “if we sell shares, that's expensive capital. It dilutes our shareholders.""

The world's nickel mines are divided into two types of deposits—sulfide and laterite. Sulfide deposits offer easier extraction while laterite deposits require more energy and chemicals.

Because of a lack of exploration in recent years, high-grade sulfide deposits are becoming depleted. Low-grade sulfide deposits offer an alternative to the more-polluting laterite deposits in Indonesia.

**‘Low Nickel Prices Drive Mines Out Of Business’**

Prices for nickel—a key material in stainless steel production and electric vehicle (EV) batteries—are down around 30% over the past year because of oversupply from Indonesian nickel mines. Tempered growth forecasts for electric vehicles (EVs) have also helped pressure prices. 

But with the tanking nickel price, these low-grade sulfide deposits are becoming uneconomical, making it harder for developers to bring them into production, Beischer said.

""There's going to be projects like ours that are discovered and advanced that are going to have difficulty getting financed while the nickel price is low,"" he said. ""At a low nickel price, it starts to drive some existing mines out of business.""

Alaska Energy Metals is developing its Nikolai nickel sulfide project on the southern flank of the Alaska Range about 124 miles southeast of Fairbanks.

North American and European nickel users should reject nickel produced in a way that creates a net detriment to the environment, even when end uses such as EVs are considered in the equation, he said.

""They can't really look themselves in the face by purchasing metals that are being produced in a manner that's anything but environmentally friendly,"" he said.

The automobile industry could play a key role in helping develop nickel deposits in North America, which has strong environmental and regulatory frameworks, he said. 

""They are going to have a much stronger lobby than the mining industry could ever have,"" he said. 

That will be needed to help burnish the mining industry's image, as the industry is still viewed by the messes it made in the old days instead of the modern methods employed among North American miners nowadays, he said.

Automakers such as **General Motors Co.** and **Tesla Inc** have been investing in mining companies or contracting with them to secure supplies of electric vehicle metals, including nickel. **Ford Motor Co.** Last year said it would take a stake in a plant under construction in Indonesia that will supply nickel chemicals for electric vehicle batteries.

“Car companies and mining companies should collaborate, and the government should save its money, but the government should also have pro-mining development policies to go with their electrification agenda,"" Beischer said.

The U.S. has ceded metal supply chains to other nations, but at the same time isn't particularly friendly to mining companies even though a lot of minerals will need to be produced to support the nation's electrification ambitions, he said. 

""There seems to be a disconnect,"" he said. ""The permitting agencies still move very slowly.""

The mining industry doesn't want to see environmental regulations rolled back in the U.S., he said. Rather, it would like to see the timeline for environmental reviews sped up, he added.

""Just make the industry feel welcome encourage mine development,"" Beischer said. ""Have the permitting agencies move at a faster rate. We've got to get this done.""

Alaska Energy Metals shares are currently up about 1.36%, trading at 29 cents on last check.

2024-03-05,07:47:21,pennystocks,AI has become the key to the chip industry recovery: Meta / Microsoft / WiMi develop their AI technology," 

Nvidia (NVDA) shares continued to rise in 2024, adding about $500 billion to its market value in about six weeks. Driven by AI, Nvidia has almost monopolized the AI chip market with an 80% market share, and the H20 chip customized for China has also accepted pre-orders.

The rise of self-generated AI has revealed the infinite possibilities of AI, and it has also spawned the demand for stronger, smarter, and more efficient AI chips. In last year’s wave of generative AI, Nvidia was the undisputed biggest winner. Predictably, AI applications are ubiquitous and have become a new battleground between chip giants.

**Meta plans to launch a new AI chip, Artemisintelligence**ial intelligence gold rush, the chip war will burn more and more in 2024. To support the artificial intelligence business, Meta (META) plans to deploy a new custom chip in its data center this year, and Meta plans to launch Artemis of AI chips for model reasoning this year, to reduce its reliance on Nvidia chips.

Meta h,as been improving its computing power to meet generative AI products in applications such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as hardware devices such as Ray-Ban smart glasses. Zuckerberg said last month that the company plans to have about 350,000 of Nvidia’s flagship H100 processors by the end of the year, and with other suppliers, Meta will have 600,000 H100 equivalent computing power.

**AMD / Microsoft makes a full preparation for AI chips**

In addition, US chip giant AMD (AMD) recently raised its 2024 AI processor sales forecast by $1.5 billion to $3.5 billion. AMD CEO Zifeng Su said on the conference call that its AI chip sales could exceed its current forecasts of $3.5 billion once more capacity starts in the second half of the year.

Microsoft (MSFT), which is betting on AI, has also launched its first AI chip, Maia 100, to compete with Nvidia’s GPU and reduce its expensive reliance on Nvidia. Maia 100 Using the 5nm process, the number of transistors reaches 105 billion, which can be used for large language model training and reasoning.

The two chips are reportedly expected to go on sale in 2024. Both custom chips power Microsoft’s Azure data center and prepare for a future full of artificial intelligence. Nadella said Maia will first support Microsoft’s own AI applications and then to partners and customers.

There is no doubt that demand for AI chips is extremely strong, and most companies around the world are looking for alternatives to the Nvidia H100. According to the latest forecast from market research firm Gartner, the AI chip market will grow 25.6% from the previous year to $67.1 billion by 2024. Gartner The AI chip marketofexpected to be more than twice the size of 2023 by 2027, reaching $119.4 billion.

**WiMi explores the value from the industrial chain**

Definitely, the outlook for AI chip demand is extremely promising. Data shows, as a leading AI vision enterprise WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) under the boom of artificial intelligence, currently in semiconductor, algorithm and holographic AR light field technology module and other core technology has strong strength, and has developed its AI chip business, to enterprise customers provide computer chip products and central processing algorithm and related services comprehensive solutions and software and semiconductor business.

At present, the new generation of artificial intelligence technology has given WiMi a new role. WiMi based on AI chip is no longer limited to command control, but to carry out more image structure and big data analysis, which requires CPU and other traditional chip architecture to meet the needs of AI applications. At the same time, with the deepening of the industry, WiMiAI chip technology has gradually expanded to the related scene. In terms of horizontal development, AI vision is promoted to intelligent home, commercial buildings, intelligent security, intelligent retail, autonomous driving, robots and other broader application scenarios.

No doubt, 2024 will be a year of strong chip growth, and AI, electrification, energy transition, etc., all need a large number of chip support. With its excellent technical strength and market performance, WiMi actively promotes the development and application of artificial intelligence technology, and plays an important role in the era of artificial intelligence. With the acceleration of the global digital transformation, WiMi is expected to maintain its lead and drive the global semiconductor industry.

**To sum up**

In the past few years, the global chip industry has been in a downturn, with the entire industry oversupply and the pressure on chip inventory increasing. Today, the development of large models and generative artificial intelligence is significantly driving the growth of the intelligent computing power market, and the various giants are driving the boom of the chip industry. However, as the competition in the AI chip market intensifies, it will be interesting to see who will emerge from the AI wave, and how this important market will change in the future.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

**Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on Platform X that Tesla’s video generation technology is the best in the world, even surpassing OpenAI’s Sora.**

A day earlier, Musk hinted that Tesla had mastered OpenAI-like video generation technology a year ago. One X user posted: ” What is OpenAI’s Sora having to do with Tesla’s FSD v12? Musk responded, ” Tesla has been able to generate real-world videos with accurate physics for about a year. It’s not particularly interesting, because all the training data comes from cars, so it looks like a Tesla video, albeit a dynamically generated (not a memory) world.”

Musk later shared several self-driving videos that Tesla created a year ago, saying in response to a user’s comment: ” Where Tesla video generation surpasses OpenAI is that it predicts extremely accurate physical scenarios. This is crucial for autonomous driving.”

In the early hours of February 16, OpenAI released the latest “Wensheng Video” model, Sora, along with a number of videos generated by Sora. Compared to the current mainstream second version of the “Wensheng Video” industry, the Sora can generate a one-minute video at once.

Sora’s release has once again attracted the attention of the entire market. Some people believe that Sora’s innovative model architecture has opened a new path for the development of large models, others believe that the launch of Sora has greatly advanced the arrival of general AI, and some market participants say that Sora’s popularity is closely linked to OpenAI’s superb marketing. Predictably, the emergence of Sora will undoubtedly promote artificial intelligence to lead a new round of industry change.

When the Vision Pro was released, Apple said the headset had more than 600 apps, so the number of apps has increased by more than 400 in the weeks since the Vision Pro launch.

Currently, Vision Pro and visionOS are in their early stages, and since the product is only available in the US, many popular apps may not be updated for visionOS until they are available in the global market.

**Nvidia will use AI to design AI chips**

According to Business Insider, companies are competing for Nvidia’s limited GPU supply of GPU used to train and build AI products, and the AI industry is booming. Now, the chip giant is using its own AI systems to speed up chip production, apparently to keep up with demand.

Nvidia has developed an AI system called ChipNeMo designed to speed up production of its GPU. Design a GPU usually requires significant manpower. Nvidia says it typically takes nearly 1,000 people to build a chip, and each person needs to understand how the different parts of the design process work together.

**Mark Gurman: The Apple Vision Pro may need four generations to reach the ” ideal form**

Mark Gurman In the article, he noted that some people on Apple’s headphone development team believe that four consecutive generations of devices may be needed to achieve the “ideal form” of Apple’s Vision Pro headset. Many Vision Pro users consider the headphones themselves too bulky for long-term use, making the miniaturization of the one-generation product an important touchstone for improvement. If the Apple team can solve these problems in four generations, Gurman believes the Vision Pro will eventually replace the iPad.

**Meta CTO: The Meta Quest will restore the eye movement tracking function**

Recently, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth talked about eye tracking technology when streaming live on its social platform. The 2022 Quest Pro features eye tracking, which the new headset Quest 3 eliminates.(In contrast, Vision Pro sees it as one of the core functions, with the device integrating four eye-tracking modules for interaction, gaze rendering, etc.).

Bosworth Mentioned that eye-tracking is one of the things it ” continues to push forward and come back to.”Similarly, Zuckerberg recently said Meta will restore eye tracking, but has not determine which future headset will use the technology.

**Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on Platform X that Tesla’s video generation technology is the best in the world, even surpassing OpenAI’s Sora.**

A day earlier, Musk hinted that Tesla had mastered OpenAI-like video generation technology a year ago. One X user posted: ” What is OpenAI’s Sora having to do with Tesla’s FSD v12? Musk responded, ” Tesla has been able to generate real-world videos with accurate physics for about a year. It’s not particularly interesting, because all the training data comes from cars, so it looks like a Tesla video, albeit a dynamically generated (not a memory) world.”

Musk later shared several self-driving videos that Tesla created a year ago, saying in response to a user’s comment: ” Where Tesla video generation surpasses OpenAI is that it predicts extremely accurate physical scenarios. This is crucial for autonomous driving.”

In the early hours of February 16, OpenAI released the latest “Wensheng Video” model, Sora, along with a number of videos generated by Sora. Compared to the current mainstream second version of the “Wensheng Video” industry, the Sora can generate a one-minute video at once.

Sora’s release has once again attracted the attention of the entire market. Some people believe that Sora’s innovative model architecture has opened a new path for the development of large models, others believe that the launch of Sora has greatly advanced the arrival of general AI, and some market participants say that Sora’s popularity is closely linked to OpenAI’s superb marketing. Predictably, the emergence of Sora will undoubtedly promote artificial intelligence to lead a new round of industry change.

Latest News:

Surge Battery Metals Inc. has unveiled its maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) for the Nevada North Lithium Project, highlighting a substantial lithium resource, marking it as the highest grade lithium clay resource in the USA. The MRE reveals 4.67 million tonnes (Mt) of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE) at a grade of 2,839 parts per million (ppm) Li, based on a cutoff of 1,250 ppm Li, and over 4 Mt of LCE at a grade of 3,167 ppm Li at a higher 2,000 ppm Li cutoff. This significant discovery emphasizes the project's potential for expansion and further development.

The CEO, Greg Reimer, expressed enthusiasm about these results and plans for continued exploration and development to expand the resource and enhance the project's certainty through drilling and technical studies. The lithium resources are primarily contained in shallow, extensive clay beds, with seven lithium-rich beds identified so far.

The MRE is based on twenty drill holes, with the lithium mineral resources hosted by multiple clay beds. The report outlines the resources' pit-constrained estimates and notes the potential for future changes in metrics such as recovery, bulk density, and operating cost based on further studies.

The company has outlined next steps, including metallurgical test work, surface exploration programs, expansion drilling, and a Preliminary Economic Assessment expected by the end of 2024. These activities aim to further validate and expand the project's lithium resources.

Now, let's create a graph based on the drill results provided. We'll visualize the lithium concentration by drill results across different cutoff grades mentioned in the press release.

[Cutoff Grades](https://preview.redd.it/dwkg36u2atkc1.png?width=1665&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a086d9b545e9caef6c090a3265f825509925ff)

The graph above illustrates the Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE) at different cutoff grades for the Nevada North Lithium Project, as announced by Surge Battery Metals Inc. It clearly shows how the LCE metric tons vary across different lithium ppm cutoff levels, providing a visual representation of the project's lithium concentration as per the recent drilling results. ​

2024-02-15,16:50:18,pennystocks,$CAUD staking it's claim in the ad-tech market," Collective Audience Is A Media Industry Game Changer; Its 47% February Rally Supports That Thesis ($CAUD)

 Collective Audience, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAUD) is a media industry game-changer in many respects. And investors are taking notice, sending CAUD shares higher by over 47% since the start of February. However, while the run is indeed impressive, it's likely the precursor to even higher gains, especially as CAUD continues to actively stake its claim in an audience-based performance advertising and ad-tech sector that's expected to reach $2.9 trillion over the next seven years.

The magnitude of how significant a trillion-dollar market potential is can't be under-appreciated, particularly at a time when the once thought of as impossible mission to become a billionaire has been scored by an ever-growing number of people. Many professional investors thought that a company reaching the trillion-dollar market cap was a far stretch of optimism. But that's been breached too, with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) all holding valuations closer to two trillion than one.

The interesting part of what's happening in the investment world is that these valuations are being scored while everyone's watching. The issue, however, is that many people and investors only see what they want to see and ignore, not always intentionally, the most monumental changes in global business and lifestyle landscapes.

**Collective Audience Targets Massive Ad-Tech Market**

A shift deserving immediate attention is how artificial intelligence, including the peripheries around it, is disrupting the way companies do business. That disruption is more than excellent news for clients needing best-in-class services; it also is for investors looking to exploit opportunities exposed by innovative companies, like Collective Audience, which are capitalizing on potentially massive revenue-generating opportunities by being in the right sector with the right products at the right time. For a company like CAUD, valued at roughly $16.06 million on Wednesday, earning just a tiny slice of the market potential can be transformative. ***(\* share price and market cap on 02/14/2024, Yahoo! Finance, 11:38 AM EST)***

But know this: CAUD wants to collect more than just market leftovers. And they intend to succeed in its mission by leveraging a products and services portfolio arsenal that can support earning an impressive share of the opportunities targeted. To ensure staying on track, CAUD has assembled a leadership team that includes a Who's Who list of best-in-industry overachievers that can turn sales ambitions into tangible revenues. The company's recently announced addition of [Peter Bordes](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/11/2793882/0/en/Collective-Audience-Appoints-Technology-Visionary-Investor-and-Executive-Leader-Peter-Bordes-as-Chief-Executive-Officer.html) as CEO complements that list.

Wall Street knows him for all the right reasons. For investors who don't and are evaluating the CAUD value proposition, pay attention because he may help to quickly close the disconnect between his company's assets, potential, and share price. There's plenty to appreciate in the bio above. But the biggest reason for investors to embrace his leadership is that he has a proven track record of making small companies bigger. In most cases, substantially so. And now leading CAUD, and alongside some of the world's brightest business minds, history in that respect may repeat.

In fact, that's likely, considering CAUD has captured one of the digital sector GOAT's, and by doing so, has positioned themselves to become one of the most dynamic and influential companies in its target markets. 

**An Innovative Products And Services Arsenal**

That presumption supports the case that even after its impressive February run, considerable earned value may still be neglected in its current market cap. Missing from its current valuation goes well beyond overlooking its leadership team. In may also neglect to fairly appraise the value inherent to CAUD assets, which already position the company to target its increasing market opportunities. More value should be applied after CAUD [announced completing](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/collective-audience-issues-shares-logiq-121000309.html) the business combination with DLQ, Inc., a former subsidiary of Logiq, Inc (OTCQX: LGIQ), and [Abri SPAC I, Inc](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASPA?p=ASPA&.tsrc=fin-srch)., a special purpose acquisition company that previously traded on NASDAQ that held an over $64 million market cap. Nearly 4X higher than CAUD's current. 

However, as noted, the valuation gap could close quickly, a likely proposition after CAUD debuted on the NASDAQ market in November 2023. That uplist could attract significant analyst attention. A bullish view could send CAUD stock prices soaring, considering that only about 13.73 million shares are O/S, with roughly 83% of those tightly held by insiders and another 5.2% owned by institutional investors. That leaves a relatively small number of shares in the public float, a consideration that can help fuel and sustain a rally.

The bullish speculation is more than warranted, especially by factoring companies needs for an ally like CAUD to help them make better use of their ad budgets and publishers needing to leverage expertise to more effectively and quickly monetize their content. Keep in mind that while the ad-tech sector is expected to reach trillion-dollar levels in less than eight years, it's already substantial, estimated at $748 billion in revenue-generating potential just three years ago. From there, and with an expected CAGR of 14.7% into the next decade, the case for CAUD bulls gets appreciably stronger, supported by a combined products and services platform specifically designed to identify, convert, and monetize the collective audience of leading brands and publishers.

**Right Space, Right Strategy, Right Assets**

Those intrinsic abilities put CAUD in an enviable spot to grow bigger and faster than even the staunchest CAUD bulls might expect. That case is not purely speculative, either. It's supported by CAUD's abilities to target lucrative opportunities alongside some of the world's largest companies, including Meta (NASDAQ: META) and those mentioned, which rely almost exclusively on ad revenues for top and bottom-line growth. That's not all. While the large caps may have the means to fend off potential problems in the competitive landscape, thousands of other companies, especially smaller ones, don't have the financial or technical resources to keep pace with changes. Their challenge can be significant value drivers for CAUD. The better news in that respect is that CAUD can provide services that others can't to fill soaring demand.

Industry competitors like The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), PubMatic (NASDAQ: PUBM), and Magnite (NASDAQ: MGNI), as good as they are in their respective target markets, certainly can't handle the entirety of the market demand. Even factoring in the niche-focused companies like Digital Turbine (NASDAQ: APPS) and DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV), while it helps, still leaves considerable revenues for the taking. CAUD intends to earn its rightful share.

That's no coincidence. As a U.S.-based provider of e-commerce and digital customer acquisition solutions that simplify digital advertising, its proof of concept and performance attracts the right eyes by being an innovative, data-driven, end-to-end provider with solutions facilitating access to data for activating campaigns across multiple channels. Its digital marketing business includes a holistic, self-serve adtech platform, a proprietary data-driven, and an AI-powered system that enables brands and agencies to advertise across thousands of the world's leading digital media and connected TV platforms. All of that's important.

Remember, digital marketing is widely considered the optimal solution for companies to communicate with prospective and existing customers to create business and brand awareness. Moreover, its value extends because digital marketing provides an easy way for companies to get creative and stand out from competitors in congested markets. That's led to significant adtech spending, with many companies targeting the customers' time spent on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Of course, those apps target millions of users. However, as large as they are, other apps, retail media, and gaming environments add billions of additional viewers' eyes. And CAUD wants to connect them to the right interest through retail media, connected television, and E-commerce channels that generate specific metrics and attribution models.

**A CAUD Valuation Disconnect Exposed**

With the tools and abilities in place to bring audience objectives to life quickly, efficiently, and effectively, CAUD is not a sector player to ignore. The 47% February increase indicates many investors aren't. But clients are taking notice, too. And that's the real value driver behind the investment proposition since it can lead to a further steepening of CAUD's revenue curve.

Thus, using virtually any valuation model, especially based on a sum of its parts calculus, CAUD presents a compelling value investment proposition. While investors are apparently taking advantage of its $1.15 share price on Wednesday, these levels still present what many refer to as ground floor levels. But with momentum at its back, bargain prices may not last much longer, a premise supported by a new era of internet and consumer landscapes that make adtech and the facilitators behind the space, like Collective Audience, an invaluable and necessary competitive tool.

The Deal? ***The ELEM/BVN LOI paves the way for the sale of ore from the Lucero property. This deal marks a pivotal moment in the Company’s journey and aligns directly with its cash-flow generation strategy for 2024.***

Compañía de Minas Buenaventura (BVN) is a Peruvian precious metals-producing company with experience in mine exploration, development, construction, and operation. It has developed a business culture that focuses on caring for the environment, the health and safety of all our collaborators, and respect for communities. BVN was the first Latin American mining company to list on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996.

CEO of Element 79 Gold, James C. Tworek, stated, “This LOI represents a pivotal moment for ELEM – Proof of Concept that this past-producing mine has valuable economic potential today – by aligning with a potential regional commercial partner, and spurring the path to restarting commercial production in the near term. Our team has a series of project milestones to achieve along the way to realizing this potential offtake, including completing a Definitive Agreement with BVN. We are confident our efforts will enrich our understanding of Lucero’s property and help unlock more of the inherent value of ELEM’s crown jewel.”

**Bottom Line**

Should investors buy ELEM? If so, I suggest employing a dollar cost-averaging strategy if ownership is on your mind. ELEM is a junior gold company acting like a senior. And if there were large sellers, they all got sucked up by buyers.

**FROM ELEM Website (I found it, so you don’t have to, but the site is very informational)**

According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, Meta is hoping that the launch of Vision Pro will help it boost the company’s XR headset business.

Meta executives, including Zuckerberg, were optimistic about the launch of Vision Pro, saying Apple’s push into the headset market would “test the possibilities of their existing business and attract more consumers” said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Apple has moved the move from virtual reality to mixed reality. With the Vision Pro released in the U. S., Meta employees believe that Quest and its software ecosystem will be Apple’s main rival in the metauniverse and a role similar to Google Android in the smartphone space.

Apple’s entry into the headset space marks the latest chapter in Apple’s competition with Meta. Meta executives and industry insiders believe the future battle will focus on software as it will play a huge role in developing apps that will attract more users.

**New AR interaction function**

In addition, Reality Labs researchers in Meta’s XR division recently demonstrated a way to interact with the real world through augmented reality. This research can not only digitize the real objects in the real world but also can seamlessly erase the corresponding real objects after generating the virtual objects.

Reality Labs The researchers called the concept “scene responsiveness,” claiming that the approach created a “visual illusion of virtual action affecting physical scenes,” and presented their results at the ACM User Interface Software and Technology Workshop late last year.

**AR growth potential in the XR market**

Apple’s Vision Pro began pre-orders on January 19, and pre-sale data for the first weekend showed initial strong demand. It is worth mentioning that before the Vision Pro launch, the global XR industry had experienced more than ten years of development, but due to the lack of high-quality content, the development of the industry encountered a bottleneck.

Now, for the development trend of the market, Apple set off a heat wave, directly driving many big factories in the XR industry are reform. Counterpoint Research Analysis, ” Although the launch of Apple Vision Pro will not immediately change the entire industry pattern, it will undoubtedly take an important step forward and will guide the future development direction of the XR industry.

**WiMi builds the AR ecosystem**

It has to be said that XR has once again become the focus of the tech industry this year, and over the past few years, everyone has been waiting for the “iPhone moment” of XR. With Apple officially entering the game, expect to be taken to a very high point. In particular, Apple’s first Vision Pro sales, hot sales are very good, to the XR industry impact is very obvious.

According to the data, the first WiMi Hologram Cloud(NASDAQ: WIMI), actively build an AR ecosystem, with AR industry as the base, accelerate the further development of industrial ecology, and will work with industry partners to build the development of XR industry.

You can see this lithium deposit from this aerial view.

See those white specks stretching over 2 kilometers? That stuff can power a Tesla… and it’s there for the taking.

This unique project in the Northwest Territories, Canada is called The Yellowknife Lithium Project. Discovered in the 1970’s, but hidden from the world, until today

Once owned by ExxonMobil in the 80s… it’s sat dormant and relatively untouched for the last 36 years.

Until now.

When a successful gold finder from the $47B Newmont Mining company, Francis MacDonald, stumbled on a major arbitrage in the lithium market.

Due to his experience in gold mining, he knew you needed 500,000 - 1.5 million meters of drilling to start a gold project. And the costs are enormous.

For copper mining, it’s 200,000 - 1 million meters of required drilling.

For lithium? *It’s only 50,000 meters of drilling*\*\*. That means less money, time, and effort to find out how much metal is in the ground.\*\*

Not only that,  there are already over 536 active gold-producing mines running right now.

Active producing lithium mines? A paltry 54.

That’s not enough.

At the moment, there are:

1. Record-breaking demand for electric vehicles (EVs)... and lithium-ion batteries.  
Plus,
2. A looming lithium shortage to hit as early as 2025… according to CNBC.

Francis took his geology and mining knowledge and founded Li-FT Power.

The company is only two years old while potentially sitting on a fascinating lithium deposit in North America.

Li-FT Power trades publicly on the US OTCQX: LIFFF

Li-FT’s a company bursting with lithium potential…

Literally coming out of the ground.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/46k2xo1871gc1.jpg?width=692&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=226ddd6a897a16437fd878975205773e6ea6b48a

Li-FT currently is drilling (as you read this) to discover how much lithium is here

Why hasn’t Yellowknife been drilled for lithium if it could be one of the greatest deposits in North America?  
Extracting any resource… from gold to copper to lithium takes:

* Time to permit and develop the mine site
* Money to do so

Companies like ExxonMobil and individuals barely touched Yellowknife for almost a century as lithium wasn’t as profitable to get out of the ground.

Only recently have EV sales picked up… lithium prices soared and then stabilized and the demand for lithium-ion batteries taken off.

It’s only now… as we face geopolitical risks and coming lithium shortages does it finally makes sense to put more shovels into the ground.

That’s the opportunity Li-FT Power and its founders see.

Over 50% of the outstanding shares of Li-FT Power are owned by the founders and early investors.  
Early Li-FT investors poured in as much as $15 million dollars *EACH* into the company to acquire the Yellowknife Project and start defining how much lithium is in the ground.

That money hasn’t gone to pay out ‘bonuses’ or waste.

Francis, the CEO, is plowing most of the cash into fast-tracking Yellowknife by drilling to determine HOW MUCH lithium is there.

Remember, this deposit has lithium containing rock that can be seen on the surface.

Now, it’s drilling down 200-300 meters and determining how big this project really is.

*“We’re hitting on 80-90% of our drill holes,”* *the CEO says.*

Meaning, 80-90% of drill tests locate more lithium.

* By mid-2024 = Li-FT should know how much lithium they’re holding.

When you hear about car companies partnering up with mines now:

* Ford *pre-purchased* one-third of the output of a lithium mine in 2022
* GM invested over $650 million bucks into a lithium mine in 2020
* Volkswagen is seeking to create what former CEO Herbert Diess has called a *“full ecosystem of suppliers from lithium extraction to the assembly of batteries”* in Spain

We’ll need 78 new mines by 2035 to accommodate total demand

But few mines are under development, and existing mines are not scaling up lithium production.

Also, lithium mines take 10+ years to bring online. So if the mine is not already under development, it’s too late.

Which is why massive shortfalls are already being predicted.

Under the best case scenario, the lithium *shortage* in three years will be as much as the entire *demand* was in 2022.

To avoid the impending crisis, EV manufacturers are taking matters into their own hands. In a rare move, they’re getting involved in lithium mining itself.

What’s unfolding is an escalating, no-holds-barred brawl for lithium supply.

* Consider Volvo, which is talking with the biggest mining companies in the world about buying a stake in their operations. Not for a profit, but just to have access to lithium.
* Volkswagen's CEO, Scott Keogh, echoes this sentiment: ""We are not going to become a mining company. But certainly, we will get significantly closer.""
* Or Ford, which pre-purchased 33% of the lithium output of a new mine in Nevada last year.
* A few months after that, GM invested $650 million in a lithium mine\*\*—also in Nevada.\*\*

GM Director of Purchasing Tanya Skilton predicts that the industry will be divided into winners and losers: Companies with minerals for “electrified dreams” will succeed.

The rest are toast.

It’s after feasibility, this type of investor interest really picks up both with the stock…

AND the potential vendors who desperately need more high-grade lithium.

Why?

Once Li-FT discovers how much lithium they can get and the way to extract it economically… companies and investors start watering at the mouth.

An example is Tesla was rumored to be in talks to buy Sigma Lithium… the massive lithium project in South America for around $3-4 billion.

That company kept updating their feasibility and reserve size to be bigger and bigger… Tesla was interested to pounce.

How big is the potential lithium motherlode  
inside Yellowknife?

*NOTE*\*: Modelling a deposit has a lot of variables, and risk. And that’s the job of seasoned analysts to determine.\*

Tesla was interested in buying Sigma Lithium, as mentioned. Today, Sigma is a $4 billion dollar lithium company in Brazil.

Their entire business centers around their one lithium project, Grota do Cirilo.

The mine’s already up, running and producing as they started working on it in 2012.

Sigma's Grota do Cirilo, is estimated to hold between 85 and 100 million metric tonnes of lithium in their mine.

What about Yellowknife?

According to Francis, the CEO…

He and his team are more than halfway through drilling to determine the actual tonnage.

Sigma is further along and now producing up to $450 million in *free cash flow* from their lithium output.

Sigma’s stock skyrocketed over 1,350% as lithium demand and prices soared… Of course, past returns are no guarantee of future returns.

Taking a further look…

LIFT’s Yellowknife lithium deposits are in yellow, and Sigma’s Groto do Cirolo deposits are in green, both at the same scale on these maps.

Let’s look at another major lithium discovery (again, this is picking the superstar assets)… Patriot Battery Metals...

* 2.5 years ago, they were worth around $10M. Today, they’re a $1.25 billion dollar company but haven’t pulled an ounce of lithium out of the ground yet.

Patriot Battery Metals project is called, *Corvette.*  
And it’s currently heralded as one of the largest lithium mining deposits in the Americas.

They show 109 million metric tonnes of lithium ore.

The project is still *years* from producing lithium revenue… worth over $1 billion… they’ve simply defined how much lithium they have in the ground.

Li-FT Power aims to have a resource estimate done in the next 8 months and will be able to share their final numbers.

If >100 million metric tonnes proves correct (that “IF” is THE high-risk with this)…

Li-FT Power could end up with a significant lithium deposit in the Americas.

The top 4 lithium projects in the Americas are owned by billion dollar companies as of this writing

One large owner, Albemarle, is worth over $16 billion. They own multiple projects globally.

Take a look:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfa9jw4e71gc1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc4d0271371aaf69bb792857368d9f9fb8a5dbf3

Yellowknife has the potential to surpass the size of these billion-dollar sites, including its neighbor, Patriot Battery Metals.

Meaning, two of the largest deposits in North America are quietly tucked away in Canada.

Yet, at the moment, Canada is a rounding error on the total lithium producers in the world.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x40ja68f71gc1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8a80bb3563aade5c5832821221fb3a13506029f

Australia leads the pack in lithium production by a wide margin followed by members of the “Lithium Triangle”, Chile and Argentina. Then, of course, China.

Canada is not even at 3% while Australia reigns at over 46%.

It’s not a shock if Canada begins making strides higher, especially in the mining space.

* Canada is already a top 5 producer of uranium, diamonds, gold, platinum, titanium, and other resource metals. Mining is in its DNA.

In Canada, thanks to the Ice Age ending only 25,000 years ago, the lithium deposits are easier to get to (cheaper to drill) and not as ‘damaged.’ The glaciers also “polished” the landscape making beautiful, pristine deposits at the surface in areas like Yellowknife.

Not only that…Many Canadian suppliers are not affiliated with China

China is a major geopolitical concern in the lithium space. A big reason being they got to the lithium first.

Their quest for more EVs before global adoption meant they snatched up mines all over the world.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/802gtirg71gc1.jpg?width=699&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae9f57ef19e86f5817adfbe14bec458db6540caa

China itself produces only 17% of the world’s raw lithium. But it has managed to wrap its tentacles around every corner of the lithium market.

It even has the lithium refining market cornered: 65% of the world’s lithium chemicals are produced in China.

For example, Australia produces about half of the world’s raw lithium—but it’s almost all owned by China:

* A Chinese lithium company owns a large stake (\~25%) in Greenbushes, the Australian lithium reserve that is the largest in the world,
* The second-largest lithium reserve in the world\*\*, also in Australia, is underwritten by Ganfeng Lithium... a Chinese company.\*\*

Nearly 60% of the world’s known reserves of lithium can be found inside a triangle that intersects the borders of  three countries – Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. (aka the “Lithium Triangle”)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i3ke293i71gc1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d3e588e8dd7ae3c0a454886241b4a6f9e2a0803

The “Lithium Triangle” holds most of the lithium reserves… and China owns a large chunk of the

Ganfeng Lithium paid $4 billion to become the second-largest shareholder in SQM, the largest lithium producer in Chile.

And in 2021, Chinese companies bought three major lithium mines in Argentina in deals worth $1.3 billion.

Most countries are trying to get out from the stranglehold of China’s grasp on the lithium market.

China’s main gig is that they own over 60% of the lithium processing capacity. Bloomberg projects they own up to “80%”. Which is quite alarming…

That’s on top of owning the actual lithium in the ground inside multiple countries.

The battle for lithium comes down to access to the lithium-ion batteries.

That’s why the US is also seeking alternative lithium supplies.

We need more lithium-ion batteries to power electric vehicles.

An electric car battery has between 30 and 60 kilos of lithium. It’s estimated that by 2034, the US alone will need 500,000 metric tons of unrefined lithium a year for EV production.

That’s more than the global supply was in 2020. And by 2030, Albemarle, the world’s largest lithium producer is projecting that 3.7 M metric tonnes of lithium will be needed.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3sugdbqj71gc1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4e06c92fa29502eaa89dbf216bdc60c2297d7f5

That’s a lot of lithium needed…

By mid-century, some experts project EVs will be nearly 100% of the market supply for vehicles.

*Boston Consulting Group* predicts electric battery-powered vehicles will surpass combustion engine vehicle sales as soon as 2028.

EV demand has picked up in just the last two years

Whether you believe gas powered cars are on their way out or not… there’s no denying EV sales are shooting upwards at the moment. Everywhere you turn in North America, there’s a Tesla driving by.

And the numbers in China are breaking new records…

If the U.S. meets its 2030 target, there will be more than 48 million EVs on the road in just seven years.

But it’s not just the US trading in gas for lithium-powered electrics…

Europeans just started buying a ton more EVs in 2021.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rc35xvrn71gc1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=662e9dedcf20685e8d09b46c941b32e93d5b1d66

EV sales have tripled in just three years.

China beat other countries to the ‘lithium punch’ early because they suck up more supply of EVs than anyone.

More EVs on the road = more lithium required.

To create one, singular lithium-ion battery to power a Tesla, you must process 25,000 pounds of brine for the lithium!

More is needed.

The International Energy Agency, an organization that tracks world energy usage,  says:

Demand for LITHIUM is growing faster than demand for any other metal or mineral

They estimate that the global demand for lithium will increase more than tenfold by 2030, and potentially 50 times greater by 2040.

Check out where the demand graph is at the moment…

&#x200B;

We’re in the early stages of lithium demand

Meaning, experts predict a near 4X increase in lithium demand. 73% of that today comes from EVs. Another block is energy storage.

Keith Phillips, CEO of Piedmont Lithium, projects we need “40X more lithium by the end of this decade.”

That may be overstating, but either way… the supply crunch is set to begin as early as 2025. And the gap will only widen as time passes.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/awni6hft71gc1.jpg?width=1347&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30ba524a0aac732715fb29052c2dbfbb95a9e7b9

We need more lithium being produced.

Well, there are large players out there. The biggest in the world own projects in the China-heavy “Lithium Triangle.”

However, getting the product out of the ground and scaling it is a problem.

The problem?

Big-time companies like Albemarle aren’t hard-rock lithium mining… they use a technique called brining.

* Brining is a process where… instead of chipping away at rock and pulling out the lithium…

Brining pumps ungodly amounts of water into lithium deposits… extracts the solution… then dries out the water to get the lithium salt remaining.

Here’s the issue…

The brining evaporating cycle takes *2 years* to complete!

In Hard Rock lithium mining, you can pull the product out and it’s commercial-ready 6 weeks later.

Yellowknife has hard-rock lithium sitting on the surface ready to be processed. Little to no water evaporating is required.

You can’t *scale* brining operations without more land and tonnes and tonnes of more water.

In Chile, brining has caused severe droughts. In Northern Chile, an entire river was dried out due to water extraction and evaporation. *“Rivers and lakes have disappeared,”* one local told the news.

To meet soaring demand…We need more hard-rock lithium miners. And with many countries turning their backs on Chinese operations...  
Canada has another opportunity to shine in the mining space.

*The lithium Project that could be at the center of it all?*

It’s called Yellowknife, as mentioned. A Project you can see from Google Maps for yourself, it’s that obvious!

Yellowknife’s owned by Li-FT Power… a two-year-old lithium mining company.

Francis MacDonald, the CEO, has put together an expert team with multiple geologists and environmental officers.

A top tier team for a top tier lithium asset. Insiders own 50% of the outstanding shares

Currently, the company is valued around $198 million, as of this writing. They hold $18 million just in cash.

The stock trades for a mere $4 under the ticker symbol: OTCMKTS: LIFFF.

The goal is to continue to develop the Yellowknife project to become one of the top deposits in not just the Americas… but also the world.

Insiders still own 50% of the stock and aren’t selling. Shares only went public in May 2023.

Lithium prices currently sit at multi-year lows.

As we see a supply crunch with demand skyrocketing, there’s no telling how long lithium prices will stay this low.

This low lithium price will discourage new lithium miners to develop.

Meaning, if competitors don’t start now, they won’t be extracting any new lithium before 2030. That could exacerbate the supply problem even further.

By then, it’s too late even if lithium prices rebound.

An investor is better to position themselves *before* lithium prices go up again. (there’s no telling when that may be).

Investing in Li-FT Power at just $4 is an easy way to gain exposure to lithium, but also enjoy watching the potential unfold.

* Their next major milestone for investors is finishing their drilling in early 2024… then a feasibility study by mid-2025.

Consider Li-FT Power (OTCMKTS: LIFFF) as a potential value play in the lithium mining space

As a bonus:

Li-FT Power also owns *four* other projects in Canada.

* Cali - acquired with Yellowknife near the Yukon border
* Rupert - located near the James Bay region of Quebec
* Pontax - located also near the James Bay region
* Moyenne - accessed via helicopter, also located in James Bay

All 4 of these ‘bonus’ assets are in pre-production. Most funding is going towards Yellowknife.

This unique project in the Northwest Territories, Canada is called The Yellowknife Lithium Project. Discovered in the 1970’s, but hidden from the world, until today

Once owned by ExxonMobil in the 80s… it’s sat dormant and relatively untouched for the last 36 years.

Until now.

When a successful gold finder from the $47B Newmont Mining company, Francis MacDonald, stumbled on a major arbitrage in the lithium market.

Due to his experience in gold mining, he knew you needed 500,000 - 1.5 million meters of drilling to start a gold project. And the costs are enormous.

For copper mining, it’s 200,000 - 1 million meters of required drilling.

For lithium? *It’s only 50,000 meters of drilling*\*\*. That means less money, time, and effort to find out how much metal is in the ground.\*\*

Not only that,  there are already over 536 active gold-producing mines running right now.

Active producing lithium mines? A paltry 54.

That’s not enough.

At the moment, there are:

1. Record-breaking demand for electric vehicles (EVs)... and lithium-ion batteries.  
Plus,
2. A looming lithium shortage to hit as early as 2025… according to CNBC.

Francis took his geology and mining knowledge and founded Li-FT Power.

The company is only two years old while potentially sitting on a fascinating lithium deposit in North America.

Li-FT Power trades publicly on the US OTCQX: LIFFF

Li-FT’s a company bursting with lithium potential…

Literally coming out of the ground.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/46k2xo1871gc1.jpg?width=692&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=226ddd6a897a16437fd878975205773e6ea6b48a

Li-FT currently is drilling (as you read this) to discover how much lithium is here

Why hasn’t Yellowknife been drilled for lithium if it could be one of the greatest deposits in North America?  
Extracting any resource… from gold to copper to lithium takes:

* Time to permit and develop the mine site
* Money to do so

Companies like ExxonMobil and individuals barely touched Yellowknife for almost a century as lithium wasn’t as profitable to get out of the ground.

Only recently have EV sales picked up… lithium prices soared and then stabilized and the demand for lithium-ion batteries taken off.

It’s only now… as we face geopolitical risks and coming lithium shortages does it finally makes sense to put more shovels into the ground.

That’s the opportunity Li-FT Power and its founders see.

Over 50% of the outstanding shares of Li-FT Power are owned by the founders and early investors.  
Early Li-FT investors poured in as much as $15 million dollars *EACH* into the company to acquire the Yellowknife Project and start defining how much lithium is in the ground.

That money hasn’t gone to pay out ‘bonuses’ or waste.

Francis, the CEO, is plowing most of the cash into fast-tracking Yellowknife by drilling to determine HOW MUCH lithium is there.

Remember, this deposit has lithium containing rock that can be seen on the surface.

Now, it’s drilling down 200-300 meters and determining how big this project really is.

*“We’re hitting on 80-90% of our drill holes,”* *the CEO says.*

Meaning, 80-90% of drill tests locate more lithium.

* By mid-2024 = Li-FT should know how much lithium they’re holding.

When you hear about car companies partnering up with mines now:

* Ford *pre-purchased* one-third of the output of a lithium mine in 2022
* GM invested over $650 million bucks into a lithium mine in 2020
* Volkswagen is seeking to create what former CEO Herbert Diess has called a *“full ecosystem of suppliers from lithium extraction to the assembly of batteries”* in Spain

We’ll need 78 new mines by 2035 to accommodate total demand

But few mines are under development, and existing mines are not scaling up lithium production.

Also, lithium mines take 10+ years to bring online. So if the mine is not already under development, it’s too late.

Which is why massive shortfalls are already being predicted.

Under the best case scenario, the lithium *shortage* in three years will be as much as the entire *demand* was in 2022.

To avoid the impending crisis, EV manufacturers are taking matters into their own hands. In a rare move, they’re getting involved in lithium mining itself.

What’s unfolding is an escalating, no-holds-barred brawl for lithium supply.

* Consider Volvo, which is talking with the biggest mining companies in the world about buying a stake in their operations. Not for a profit, but just to have access to lithium.
* Volkswagen's CEO, Scott Keogh, echoes this sentiment: ""We are not going to become a mining company. But certainly, we will get significantly closer.""
* Or Ford, which pre-purchased 33% of the lithium output of a new mine in Nevada last year.
* A few months after that, GM invested $650 million in a lithium mine\*\*—also in Nevada.\*\*

GM Director of Purchasing Tanya Skilton predicts that the industry will be divided into winners and losers: Companies with minerals for “electrified dreams” will succeed.

The rest are toast.

It’s after feasibility, this type of investor interest really picks up both with the stock…

AND the potential vendors who desperately need more high-grade lithium.

Why?

Once Li-FT discovers how much lithium they can get and the way to extract it economically… companies and investors start watering at the mouth.

An example is Tesla was rumored to be in talks to buy Sigma Lithium… the massive lithium project in South America for around $3-4 billion.

That company kept updating their feasibility and reserve size to be bigger and bigger… Tesla was interested to pounce.

How big is the potential lithium motherlode  
inside Yellowknife?

*NOTE*\*: Modelling a deposit has a lot of variables, and risk. And that’s the job of seasoned analysts to determine.\*

Tesla was interested in buying Sigma Lithium, as mentioned. Today, Sigma is a $4 billion dollar lithium company in Brazil.

Their entire business centers around their one lithium project, Grota do Cirilo.

The mine’s already up, running and producing as they started working on it in 2012.

Sigma's Grota do Cirilo, is estimated to hold between 85 and 100 million metric tonnes of lithium in their mine.

What about Yellowknife?

According to Francis, the CEO…

He and his team are more than halfway through drilling to determine the actual tonnage.

Sigma is further along and now producing up to $450 million in *free cash flow* from their lithium output.

Sigma’s stock skyrocketed over 1,350% as lithium demand and prices soared… Of course, past returns are no guarantee of future returns.

Taking a further look…

LIFT’s Yellowknife lithium deposits are in yellow, and Sigma’s Groto do Cirolo deposits are in green, both at the same scale on these maps.

Let’s look at another major lithium discovery (again, this is picking the superstar assets)… Patriot Battery Metals...

* 2.5 years ago, they were worth around $10M. Today, they’re a $1.25 billion dollar company but haven’t pulled an ounce of lithium out of the ground yet.

Patriot Battery Metals project is called, *Corvette.*  
And it’s currently heralded as one of the largest lithium mining deposits in the Americas.

They show 109 million metric tonnes of lithium ore.

The project is still *years* from producing lithium revenue… worth over $1 billion… they’ve simply defined how much lithium they have in the ground.

Li-FT Power aims to have a resource estimate done in the next 8 months and will be able to share their final numbers.

If >100 million metric tonnes proves correct (that “IF” is THE high-risk with this)…

Li-FT Power could end up with a significant lithium deposit in the Americas.

The top 4 lithium projects in the Americas are owned by billion dollar companies as of this writing

One large owner, Albemarle, is worth over $16 billion. They own multiple projects globally.

Take a look:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfa9jw4e71gc1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc4d0271371aaf69bb792857368d9f9fb8a5dbf3

Yellowknife has the potential to surpass the size of these billion-dollar sites, including its neighbor, Patriot Battery Metals.

Meaning, two of the largest deposits in North America are quietly tucked away in Canada.

Yet, at the moment, Canada is a rounding error on the total lithium producers in the world.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x40ja68f71gc1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8a80bb3563aade5c5832821221fb3a13506029f

Australia leads the pack in lithium production by a wide margin followed by members of the “Lithium Triangle”, Chile and Argentina. Then, of course, China.

Canada is not even at 3% while Australia reigns at over 46%.

It’s not a shock if Canada begins making strides higher, especially in the mining space.

* Canada is already a top 5 producer of uranium, diamonds, gold, platinum, titanium, and other resource metals. Mining is in its DNA.

In Canada, thanks to the Ice Age ending only 25,000 years ago, the lithium deposits are easier to get to (cheaper to drill) and not as ‘damaged.’ The glaciers also “polished” the landscape making beautiful, pristine deposits at the surface in areas like Yellowknife.

Not only that…Many Canadian suppliers are not affiliated with China

China is a major geopolitical concern in the lithium space. A big reason being they got to the lithium first.

Their quest for more EVs before global adoption meant they snatched up mines all over the world.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/802gtirg71gc1.jpg?width=699&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae9f57ef19e86f5817adfbe14bec458db6540caa

China itself produces only 17% of the world’s raw lithium. But it has managed to wrap its tentacles around every corner of the lithium market.

It even has the lithium refining market cornered: 65% of the world’s lithium chemicals are produced in China.

For example, Australia produces about half of the world’s raw lithium—but it’s almost all owned by China:

* A Chinese lithium company owns a large stake (\~25%) in Greenbushes, the Australian lithium reserve that is the largest in the world,
* The second-largest lithium reserve in the world\*\*, also in Australia, is underwritten by Ganfeng Lithium... a Chinese company.\*\*

Nearly 60% of the world’s known reserves of lithium can be found inside a triangle that intersects the borders of  three countries – Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. (aka the “Lithium Triangle”)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i3ke293i71gc1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d3e588e8dd7ae3c0a454886241b4a6f9e2a0803

The “Lithium Triangle” holds most of the lithium reserves… and China owns a large chunk of the

Ganfeng Lithium paid $4 billion to become the second-largest shareholder in SQM, the largest lithium producer in Chile.

And in 2021, Chinese companies bought three major lithium mines in Argentina in deals worth $1.3 billion.

Most countries are trying to get out from the stranglehold of China’s grasp on the lithium market.

China’s main gig is that they own over 60% of the lithium processing capacity. Bloomberg projects they own up to “80%”. Which is quite alarming…

That’s on top of owning the actual lithium in the ground inside multiple countries.

The battle for lithium comes down to access to the lithium-ion batteries.

That’s why the US is also seeking alternative lithium supplies.

We need more lithium-ion batteries to power electric vehicles.

An electric car battery has between 30 and 60 kilos of lithium. It’s estimated that by 2034, the US alone will need 500,000 metric tons of unrefined lithium a year for EV production.

That’s more than the global supply was in 2020. And by 2030, Albemarle, the world’s largest lithium producer is projecting that 3.7 M metric tonnes of lithium will be needed.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3sugdbqj71gc1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4e06c92fa29502eaa89dbf216bdc60c2297d7f5

That’s a lot of lithium needed…

By mid-century, some experts project EVs will be nearly 100% of the market supply for vehicles.

*Boston Consulting Group* predicts electric battery-powered vehicles will surpass combustion engine vehicle sales as soon as 2028.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uodfml6l71gc1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce7cfb6ea2f8d1cb555fe1d3088677f323c42338

EV demand has picked up in just the last two years

Whether you believe gas powered cars are on their way out or not… there’s no denying EV sales are shooting upwards at the moment. Everywhere you turn in North America, there’s a Tesla driving by.

And the numbers in China are breaking new records…

If the U.S. meets its 2030 target, there will be more than 48 million EVs on the road in just seven years.

But it’s not just the US trading in gas for lithium-powered electrics…

Europeans just started buying a ton more EVs in 2021.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rc35xvrn71gc1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=662e9dedcf20685e8d09b46c941b32e93d5b1d66

EV sales have tripled in just three years.

China beat other countries to the ‘lithium punch’ early because they suck up more supply of EVs than anyone.

More EVs on the road = more lithium required.

To create one, singular lithium-ion battery to power a Tesla, you must process 25,000 pounds of brine for the lithium!

More is needed.

The International Energy Agency, an organization that tracks world energy usage,  says:

Demand for LITHIUM is growing faster than demand for any other metal or mineral

They estimate that the global demand for lithium will increase more than tenfold by 2030, and potentially 50 times greater by 2040.

Check out where the demand graph is at the moment…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xcnwyyyo71gc1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c083b7e32b02944167df314899da27eaf46b02ee

We’re in the early stages of lithium demand

Meaning, experts predict a near 4X increase in lithium demand. 73% of that today comes from EVs. Another block is energy storage.

Keith Phillips, CEO of Piedmont Lithium, projects we need “40X more lithium by the end of this decade.”

That may be overstating, but either way… the supply crunch is set to begin as early as 2025. And the gap will only widen as time passes.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/awni6hft71gc1.jpg?width=1347&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30ba524a0aac732715fb29052c2dbfbb95a9e7b9

We need more lithium being produced.

Well, there are large players out there. The biggest in the world own projects in the China-heavy “Lithium Triangle.”

However, getting the product out of the ground and scaling it is a problem.

The problem?

Big-time companies like Albemarle aren’t hard-rock lithium mining… they use a technique called brining.

* Brining is a process where… instead of chipping away at rock and pulling out the lithium…

Brining pumps ungodly amounts of water into lithium deposits… extracts the solution… then dries out the water to get the lithium salt remaining.

Here’s the issue…

The brining evaporating cycle takes *2 years* to complete!

In Hard Rock lithium mining, you can pull the product out and it’s commercial-ready 6 weeks later.

Yellowknife has hard-rock lithium sitting on the surface ready to be processed. Little to no water evaporating is required.

You can’t *scale* brining operations without more land and tonnes and tonnes of more water.

In Chile, brining has caused severe droughts. In Northern Chile, an entire river was dried out due to water extraction and evaporation. *“Rivers and lakes have disappeared,”* one local told the news.

To meet soaring demand…We need more hard-rock lithium miners. And with many countries turning their backs on Chinese operations...  
Canada has another opportunity to shine in the mining space.

*The lithium Project that could be at the center of it all?*

It’s called Yellowknife, as mentioned. A Project you can see from Google Maps for yourself, it’s that obvious!

Yellowknife’s owned by Li-FT Power… a two-year-old lithium mining company.

Francis MacDonald, the CEO, has put together an expert team with multiple geologists and environmental officers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m2ex2n0v71gc1.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b6233ee0fea28d7730cb4e0f7c704e76e9f4bc1

A top tier team for a top tier lithium asset. Insiders own 50% of the outstanding shares

Currently, the company is valued around $198 million, as of this writing. They hold $18 million just in cash.

The stock trades for a mere $4 under the ticker symbol: OTCMKTS: LIFFF.

The goal is to continue to develop the Yellowknife project to become one of the top deposits in not just the Americas… but also the world.

Insiders still own 50% of the stock and aren’t selling. Shares only went public in May 2023.

Lithium prices currently sit at multi-year lows.

As we see a supply crunch with demand skyrocketing, there’s no telling how long lithium prices will stay this low.

This low lithium price will discourage new lithium miners to develop.

Meaning, if competitors don’t start now, they won’t be extracting any new lithium before 2030. That could exacerbate the supply problem even further.

By then, it’s too late even if lithium prices rebound.

An investor is better to position themselves *before* lithium prices go up again. (there’s no telling when that may be).

Investing in Li-FT Power at just $4 is an easy way to gain exposure to lithium, but also enjoy watching the potential unfold.

* Their next major milestone for investors is finishing their drilling in early 2024… then a feasibility study by mid-2025.

Consider Li-FT Power (OTCMKTS: LIFFF) as a potential value play in the lithium mining space

As a bonus:

Li-FT Power also owns *four* other projects in Canada.

* Cali - acquired with Yellowknife near the Yukon border
* Rupert - located near the James Bay region of Quebec
* Pontax - located also near the James Bay region
* Moyenne - accessed via helicopter, also located in James Bay

All 4 of these ‘bonus’ assets are in pre-production. Most funding is going towards Yellowknife.

The preceding proves that you need lithium exposure. Doubtful?

A typical EV battery has about 8 kilograms of lithium, 14 kilograms of cobalt, and 20 kilograms of manganese.

From Katusa;

*Car companies are biting their nails due to shrinking lithium supply-to-demand*

*Remember, this deposit* ***has a lithium-containing rock that can be seen on the surface***\*.\*

*Now, it’s drilling down 200–300 meters and determining how big this project is.* ***“We’re hitting on 80–90% of our drill holes,”*** *the CEO says.*

*This means 80–90% of drill tests locate more lithium.*

***By mid-2024*** *= Li-FT should know how much lithium they’re holding.*

*When you hear about car companies partnering up with mine now:*

***Ford*** \*pre-purchased one-third of the output of a lithium mine in 2022.\****GM*** *invested over $650 million bucks into a lithium mine in 2020.*

***Volkswagen*** *seeks to create what former CEO Herbert Diess has called a “full ecosystem of suppliers from lithium extraction to the assembly of batteries” in Spain.*

*Car companies are biting their nails due to the shrinking lithium supply-to-demand.*

I would go out on a reasonable limb and say that if LIFT is already a big deal, it is well on its way. A 52-week trade range of CDN4.00 to CDN11 shows the interest already. Management owns over 50% of the shares and bought with their money. One put in CDN15 million.

 In fact, as an integrated innovation and fusion application integrating the Internet, big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, virtual reality and other technologies, the metaverse is the future industry with high hopes. Many industry experts in the industry point out that the metaverse still has a large potential, but its definition and application have changed during this period, especially in the enterprise field —— the future lies not in the exclusive digital utopia, but in the seamless integration with the physical world. 

Data show that in the past few years, Metaverse holographic AR first WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI), with augmented reality and artificial intelligence, through the support of high technology, break the restrictions of the real stage, complete the interaction of virtual and real scenes, create an immersive environment, and create a smart visual feast. Committed to creating an immersive visual experience, WiMi Hologram Cloud aims to connect with the world and become a virtual digital experience anytime, anywhere, creating value for users at specific stages.

2024-01-15,08:12:31,pennystocks,"Tech market brings important development opportunities, AIGC is firmly top 1 in the current technology field","&#x200B;

The year of 2023 has been a unique year for AI which occured countless product launches, power changes within the company, and the race to launch the next major AIGC innovation.

Currently, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has been huge success, prompting each major technology company to release its own version. Large technology companies have fully invested in the development of generative AI, and various AI models have emerged, such as Meta (META) LLaMA 2, Google’s (GOOG) Bard chatbot and Gemini

In addition, generative AI allows artificial intelligence technology to develop, bringing a historical turning point in the large-scale adoption of machine learning. The new round of technological revolution initiated by generative AI is far beyond the imagination of ordinary people today, which means that a huge historical opportunity is coming.

From an application point of view, various applications derived from generative AI are gradually trying to land in various industries, including art generation, text generation, music generation, and more complex tasks, such as video generation and virtual reality environment generation. Generative AI-based knowledge base search, text summary, content, or code creation takes productivity to a new stage.

Generative artificial intelligence (AIGC) is firmly top 1 in the current technology field, and AIGC represents a new trend of AI technology development. In the past, traditional AI favored analytical capabilities, but now AI is generating new content, making a leap from perceptual understanding of the world to creating the world. According to the prediction of industry insiders, from 2024, it will enter the era of generative AI applications, and even become the 2.0 era of changing traditional industries.

Generated AI will contribute about $7 trillion to the global economy and increase the overall economic benefits of AI by about 50 percent, according to data released by leading consultancy McKinsey. According to the “Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends of 2024” released by global IT research and consulting firm Gartner, by 2026, more than 80% of enterprises will be connected to generative AI or large models, but the proportion is less than 5% at the beginning of 2023.

**Companies began to compete in the AI field**

Due to the rise of generative AI, especially the application of large language model, is fundamentally change the operation of technology industry, industry technology is driven by AI into a new era, this will prompt generative AI and industry model technology, no longer limited to the boundary of the industry, become an important strategic development direction of technology giants.

In January, Microsoft released Azure OpenAI services by combining Azure’s enterprise capabilities with OpenAI’s generative AI model capabilities; in March, Google opened the API of the AI big model PaLM and introduced generative AI into Google’s enterprise online collaboration platform Google Workspace.

Amazon (AMZN) entered generative AI a little later than Microsoft and Google, but the company has not followed the two giants, taking a new approach. According to the news, Amazon recently announced the launch of a number of blockbuster releases around the theme of reconstructing cloud infrastructure, computing, storage, and enterprise generated AI, to help cloud customers quickly realize digital transformation and improve the speed of enterprise generated AI innovation.

In addition, Amazon has introduced five new Amazon SageMaker features that make it easier and faster for enterprises to build, train and deploy machine learning models that support a variety of generative AI usage scenarios, enabling customers to easily integrate generative AI into their workflow.

According to public information, WiMi Hologram Cloud is committed to cutting-edge research and development in the field of artificial intelligence, and constantly expands its application scope. It has excellent technical strength and rich experience in application scenarios. Now, generative AI is becoming a hot spot in the industry. WiMi Hologram Cloud will use existing AI models and technical strength, and use new AIGC technology to empower various industries, so as to provide more intelligent solutions and help vertical industries complete the development of digital intelligence, so as to achieve comprehensive empowerment.

The emergence of AIGC is bringing disruptive changes to every industry, leading all industries to an era of efficiency. It is foreseeable that AIGC is both an important opportunity and an inevitable trend. With the continuous progress of artificial intelligence technology, the capability and quality of AIGC are also constantly improving. In the future, the application scenarios will be more diversified, which will bring more possibilities for all walks of life.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

New to trading. So I don't know if this question even makes sense. 

So here's the scenario - 
If a penny stocks company increases it's shares value by 10% in 1 month. 
And if a big company like Tesla increases it's shares value by 10% in 1 month. 

And I've spent £100 in both. 
Shouldn't my return profit be the same??
Won't I have £110 end of month in both scenarios? Even if their shares value are very different, the percent increase is the same. So my return on investment is the same?


So apart from the potential for quick big percentages increase, why isn't it a good idea to spend the same money on a big company which is always increasing it's value every year instead of up and down like most penny stocks?

2024-01-21,03:38:26,robinhood,Question on selling/rebalancing," 

I have a trading Roth where I do some swing trading, and I have a longer-term one.

On my longer-term Roth, I was usually adding every week and buying more of my long-term positions or starting new ones to create even more diversity. Unfortunately, that has to stop at the moment. But I want to start those new positions, so I am wondering if this is smart to do or not.

On my appreciated positions, is it okay to sell just the dollar amount of cost basis and let the rest of the gains ride? What I want to do is sell in that respect and then start positions in new stocks. Here's specifically an example: with SHOP, a stock I really believe in, I want to sell out just the cost basis and then buy MSFT with it (SHOP has doubled for me). I have been swing-trading MSFT in the other account, but now I want it for the long term. Same thing with NFLX...that one isn't a double, up 35%, and I would like to sell that cost basis and buy META (again, been swinging META).

Is doing this technically the same thing as the term rebalancing? And I should note: I assume it would make no sense to do this with a dividend-paying stock, because presumably, the entire amount, including the cost basis, is generating a return? Would this be mathematically correct, or is it recommended to trim some of an appreciated dividend-payer (again, would this be rebalancing, which is often recommended)? It's hard for me to sell the cost basis of something like KO or O.

While AI-focused companies like **DeepSeek** have strong potential, they are limited to AI and lack **Nvidia’s** diversified foundation.

What truly sets **Nvidia** apart is its resilience and diversification: **$NVDA** has consistently rebounded from downturns, including the COVID-19 crash and the 2018 crypto crash. Beyond AI, **Nvidia** dominates in GPUs, automotive technology, and data centers, further strengthening its market supremacy.

I truly believe **Nvidia** will bounce back, as it always has through past market crashes. On the other hand, an AI startup in China claiming to operate with just $5M? I remain skeptical, especially considering the regulatory environment in the CCP-controlled system. Notably, **DeepSeek**, reportedly has access to about **50,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs**, underscoring Nvidia's significant role in the AI landscape. 

Therefore, while **DeepSeek's $5 million budget reflects the costs associated with their AI-focused initiatives**, it **does not account for the extensive and varied operations that contribute to Nvidia's higher operating expenses**. Also, do not forget that Nvidia provides technology to many of the worlds leading data centers like, **AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google cloud and Meta** \- just to name a few. 

Time and time again, **$NVDA** has shown an impressive ability to recover and grow. This dip? A prime opportunity to secure a long-term winner.

2025-01-16,00:20:25,trading,I Asked AI to Build the 'Best' Trading Strategy,"So, I recently asked Chad Geepeetee to create the ultimate trading strategy. I told it to think really outside of the box and run troubleshooting and refinement iterations about 30 times. Here’s the strategy it generated.

# The Quantum Flux Edge Strategy

The idea behind this strategy is that markets are like particles in quantum mechanics—constantly fluctuating between states of order and chaos. The strategy works by exploiting ""flux zones,"" which are areas of transition between calm and volatile price action.

# The Rules

1. **Identify the Flux Zone:**
   * Use a 3-line EMA cloud (8, 13, and 21) to identify the ""market flux.""
   * A flux zone occurs when the EMAs converge within a range of 5% of the asset's average daily range (ADR).
2. **Quantum State Confirmation:**
   * Overlay a custom oscillator called the ""Quantum Flow Index"" (QFI). It’s basically RSI + Bollinger Bands + a noise filter from Heikin-Ashi candles.
   * When the QFI crosses above 55 in a flux zone, it signals that the market is moving into a state of order. Below 45 indicates chaos.
3. **Entry Signals:**
   * Enter a **long** trade when:
      * The price breaks out of the flux zone upward with at least a 1.5x ATR candle.
      * The QFI is above 55 and rising.
      * The volume on the breakout is 20% above the 10-day moving average.
   * Enter a **short** trade when:
      * The price breaks below the flux zone with the same conditions reversed.
4. **Profit Targets and Stops:**
   * Target: Use Fibonacci extensions of 1.618 from the flux zone range for exits.
   * Stop: Place stops just outside the flux zone.

   * This is the unique part: before any trade, check for an ""entropy spike,"" which occurs when the QFI diverges from price direction for more than 3 consecutive bars. If it happens, no trade—it means the market's ""quantum state"" is unpredictable.

2025-01-15,00:08:40,trading,Mental,I need help with mentally getting over being right on a trade but at the wrong price. I’m again and again finding that my convictions are correct time and time again but at the wrong price. Today for example I shorted TSLA at the 419.89 mark and I gave it to 422.50 as my stop and it traded to 422.62 and I got stopped out. I shorted again into a BB in the 416 range and it went about a dollar against me so I got stopped out again and then it proceeded to go to 395. I was correct both times and it would have been a trade of the year probably going 20+ points in my favor. I have a small account so I don’t have the luxury of letting  the trade go against me more.

2025-01-14,20:16:07,trading,Using two separate orders instead of OCO ,"I'm trying to trade a stock using a margin account (TSLA, nothing weird). When I enter a position I want to be able to separately set a limit and stop order above and below the position. thinkorswim forces you to do an OCO. They won't let you create two separate orders.

Example:

buy 100 shares of TSLA at $400

put in limit sell order for 405.00 (this is fine)

put in stop sell order for 395.00 (this gives an error, however I can do this in their paper trading account)

The reason I don't want to use an OCO is because it is slower than putting in two separate orders. Any advice here? Are there any other recommended brokers that would allow you to do this.

  
Any help would be greatly appreciated. thank you",TSLA,Tesla

2025-01-10,20:09:08,trading,Tesla Intraday Trading - Double Chances or Double Trouble?,"Dear Trading Community,

I had an enlightening idea while showering this morning that's either completely idiotic or absolutely brilliant. Let's philosophize about Tesla and the art of leveraged trading.

The thesis is actually quite simple:

Tesla is notoriously more volatile than a teenager's mood swings. So why not capitalize on this volatility? The plan: Every morning at the same time, simultaneously open both a long and short position with moderate leverage (5-15x). Tesla will inevitably move in *some* direction (unless it's another sideways market day, but who believes in those with Tesla anyway).

As soon as one position turns green - cash out. The other position? Well, we let it ride, because Tesla swings back and forth like a metronome on speed. The price will eventually reverse... or not.

**But seriously, let's talk risks:**
- Double position fees
- Spread costs in both directions
- If Tesla really crashes or moons, one position gets completely wiped
- The notorious theta decay eats away at both positions
- Musk might tweet. Need I say more?

What do you think about this ""foolproof"" strategy? Is this the path to quick riches or an express ticket to the savings account? Has anyone experimented with similar approaches?

P.S.: This is not financial advice. I sometimes eat crayons for breakfast.",TSLA,Tesla

2025-01-06,12:43:26,trading,Why is trading working out for me? I need advice to be better/improve,"No I don’t mean one of those people who  just started trading 6 months ago and gambled 80% of my money on penny stocked and options and made $10k

I’ve been “trading” for 4 years. I’m not an expert by any means. But I’m actually doing pretty well and I just wanna stay humble because once you start getting too confident, you start messing up.

I started by dabbling around with a few stocks like Tesla and apple. Then I discovered bitcoin. Slowly got into that and admittedly made most of my money from bitcoin. I worked my ass off investing a lot of my money into bitcoin. THEN I got into stocks. I also got more comfortable with doge coin. 

I started very little. Making $10-$80 swing trade gains. Getting used to the feeling of losses. Researching stocks. Learning to not panic and try to make my money back when I lose some money.

As of now, most of my money is in bitcoin and I’m okay with that. I’ve also played with doge, but I stayed really patient. Was down $7k and just waited it out. It was very discouraging. But I stayed patient and I made so much money from bitcoin and doge coin. I started playing with options and thankfully did not get caught up into gambling and losing my money. 

BUT, I started getting more and more into stocks. Researching companies, especially AI industry. So I am not stupid  enough to just put 80% of my money in penny stocks.y net worst is $120k I am 24 years old. And I’ve been investing / swing trading penny stocks such as BBAI, SERV, KULR, SOUN and also some NVDA along with holding my bitcoin and holding/selling my dogecoin. I am not investing/trading  these stocks because of hype only. But also because of the company having potential. I only put $10k max into stocks. 

I’ve learned to manage my risk by researching companies especially with CHATGPT. Thinking more before taking a loss or gain. Not putting my self in a position to panic. For example, if bitcoin crashes, it’ll hurt but I won’t panic because even though I have a LOT in bitcoin , I believe in it. If doge crashes, it’ll hurt a lot but I didn’t put all my money. I might panic a little tbh though lol. With the stocks, especially penny stocks, even if they all crashed, it will hurt a lot but I won’t panic because I put less than 10% in stocks, I researched the stocks, and I diversified my portfolio 

I’ve been making better gains. I’m not a good trader. But I’ve been taking it slow with stocks. My gains/losses for the past 14 months at $6700 gains and $3500 losses. But I’ve gotten better at making more profit. Now I have made more around $100 to $1500 profit and got used to losing money. I don’t use stop losses because I don’t invest enough money to need to panic if they crash. But essentially, I’ve just learned to not panic and to not put my self in a position to panic and I’ve learned to do more research. I’ve learned to handle losses, be patient, and balance patience, and learning when to take a loss or gain.

I don’t have a handbook or anything. But my “skill” seems to be like it’s just intuition at this point which makes me very uncomfortable because it feels like I’m lying to my self and will fail soon. All I can say is that I’ve learned to not risk all my money in one place(aside bitcoin lol), understand how much I can put and handle losing without losing my mind, diversifying, researching, BEING PATIENT, thinking before taking a loss or gain, learn from mistakes of any losses, not be crazy and try to make all my money back if I lost any, take it slow until my intuition and skills gets better (that’s why my net profit is $3000 past 14 months from stocks), and NOT GAMBLE WITH OPTIONS!!!!!! 

I’d often look and just wonder how in the world people lose 90% of their money and it turns out it’s just gambling most your money in risky stocks, options, penny stocks etc and just trying to get rich quick

I’m 24, 120k$ net worth, wanna start a business, wanna get better at trading. I’m lowkey clueless in a way. I feel “smart” because I’ve made money but I’m not smart at all which is why I am asking for advice on how to be an actual successful trader based on my current experience ",TSLA,Tesla

2025-01-05,20:08:56,trading,ChatGPT for beginner traders,"If you're new to trading or partly on your way to becoming a trader then you'll know there's all kinds of info that gets thrown your way and you don't really know what's useful and what isn't.  
You can use chatgpt to filter out some of that info, and also because many people ask how they can backtest a strategy then this is also useful.

Below is an example of how I used chatgpt to do a simple backtest. As long as your strategy has definite rules for entry/exit/risk etc then you can do this.

For example, you may have heard that MACD is a good indicator, well it can be, but below is a test using only the MACD indicator on eur/usd Daily chart over the last 5 years, and using entry/exit rules that a typical beginner trader might use.

**1.** (I typed this into chatgpt)

Can you backtest eur/usd on daily timeframe for the last 5 years using following rules?

1. when macd cross up, open long trade at candle close with stop loss 2 pips under candle low.
2. when macd cross down, open short trade at candle close with stop loss 2 pips above candle high.
3. exit trade when macd crosses back in opposite direction.
4. risk 1% of capital per trade, starting capital is 10,000USD

**2.** (chatgpt responded)  
I can run a backtest based on the rules you've outlined. Here's a breakdown of how I'll proceed:

Steps to Backtest  
Data Collection: I'll fetch EUR/USD historical data for the daily timeframe for the last 5 years.  
MACD Calculation: Compute the MACD indicator and identify crossovers.  
Trading Logic:  
Long when MACD crosses up and close trade when MACD crosses down.  
Short when MACD crosses down and close trade when MACD crosses up.  
Risk Management:  
Use a stop-loss as specified (2 pips below/above the signal candle).  
Risk 1% of capital per trade.  
Capital Tracking: Track account balance and calculate the performance.  
I'll begin by fetching the historical EUR/USD data and proceed with the backtest. Let me set up the calculations.

It seems that the required library (yfinance) to fetch the historical data isn't installed in my current environment. Let me approach this differently:  
I can guide you to download the EUR/USD historical data from platforms like Yahoo Finance or any trading platform you use (e.g., MetaTrader, TradingView).  
Alternatively, you can upload a CSV file of EUR/USD daily historical data, and I can proceed with the backtesting.  
Would you like to upload the data, or should I provide instructions for downloading it? ​

**3.** I then uploaded the necessary eur/usd historical data in a csv file.

You can download currency pair data from various sites, just Google ""Forex currency pair historical data"".  
It needs to be in .csv file form.  
You can make a .csv file really easy in google sheets, it's just copy/paste stuff.

**4.** (chatgpt responded below)

Great! You've uploaded the historical data file. Let me take a look at the contents to ensure it's suitable for the backtest. I'll load and inspect the data now.  
The uploaded file appears to contain historical EUR/USD data, but the column names are not properly labeled. Based on the data structure, the columns likely represent the following:

Date/Time  
Open  
High  
Low  
Close  
Volume (optional)

I'll rename the columns appropriately and ensure the data is ready for the backtest. Let me proceed. ​​  
The data is now cleaned and ready for analysis. It contains the following columns:

Date: The trading date.  
Open, High, Low, Close: The respective prices for each day.  
Volume: Trading volume (optional for this backtest).

Next, I'll calculate the MACD indicator and implement the backtesting logic based on your rules. Let me proceed. ​​  
The MACD and Signal line have been successfully calculated and added to the dataset. Now, I’ll implement the backtesting logic based on your rules:

Entry Conditions:  
Open a long position when the MACD crosses above the Signal line.  
Open a short position when the MACD crosses below the Signal line.

Exit Conditions:  
Close the position when the MACD crosses in the opposite direction.

Risk Management:  
Set stop-loss 2 pips below (for long) or above (for short) the entry candle.

Position Sizing:  
Risk 1% of the capital per trade.

Let me implement this logic and simulate the trades. ​​  
The backtesting is complete! Here's a summary:

Key Results:

Initial Capital: $10,000  
Final Capital: $5,951.49  
Number of Trades: 94  
Example of Trade History:

Date Type Entry Stop Loss Size Exit PnL  
2018-01-02 Buy 1.20614 1.20058 17985.61 1.19698 -164.75  
2018-01-12 Buy 1.21993 1.20381 6101.27 1.23666 102.07  
2018-03-06 Buy 1.24155 1.23261 11115.58 1.23084 -119.05  
2024-12-27 Buy 1.04225 1.04029 31519.40 1.03507 -226.31

The strategy resulted in a significant drawdown.  
If you'd like, I can analyze the performance further (e.g., win rate, average trade size, or profit factor) or test variations of the strategy to improve results. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

**5.** That's it. If you like you can go on to ask chatgpt to visualize the results in the form of an equity curve, calculate data such as sharpe ratio, profit factor, max drawdown, max losing streak etc etc.  
This was all done pretty quick and dirty, but it's a very handy tool to use as part of your trading journey.  
So next time someone tries to sell you some fancy indicator or strategy, if you have the indicator code, or the strategy rules, then you can test it for yourself before risking any real money or convincing yourself you've found the holy grail.

2024-12-16,22:15:41,trading,Stocks Trading 101: My Guide to the Basics,"When I first started looking into stock trading, the sheer amount of jargon felt overwhelming. Over time, I realized that understanding these terms is half the battle. Here are some key concepts and terms that helped me make sense of it all.

Stock: A piece of ownership in a company.  
  
Share: One unit of stock or a slice of the company pie.  
  
Broker: The service or app that connects buyers and sellers; I’ve used platforms like Robinhood and TD Ameritrade to get started.

Bid Price: The most someone is willing to pay for a stock at that moment.

Ask Price: The lowest price someone is willing to sell for.

Spread: The gap between the bid and ask prices. Smaller spreads often mean more activity and easier trades.

Market Order: Buying or selling instantly at the current price.

Limit Order: Setting a specific price at which to buy or sell; I use this when I don’t want to pay more or accept less than a certain amount.

Stop Loss Order: Automatically sells to prevent big losses if the stock price drops too much.

Trailing Stop Order: Similar to a stop loss, but moves up with the stock price to lock in profits as the price rises.

Bull Market: When stock prices are generally going up.

Bear Market: When stock prices are falling.

Volatility: Measures how much stock prices go up and down, with higher volatility meaning bigger swings.

Liquidity: Refers to how easy it is to buy or sell a stock without affecting its price much. Stocks with high liquidity feel less stressful to trade.

Candlestick Chart: Shows price movements over a specific period with details on opening, closing, highest, and lowest prices.

Support Level: A price where a stock tends to stop falling and bounce back up.

Resistance Level: A price where a stock tends to stop rising and reverse.

Trend Line: Shows the general direction of a stock’s price.

Moving Average (MA): Smooths out price fluctuations to reveal trends more clearly.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): A company’s profit divided by the number of shares. Higher EPS usually indicates more profitability.

Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E): Shows how much investors are willing to pay for $1 of earnings. A high P/E could mean the stock is overvalued or reflect high growth expectations.

Dividends: Portions of profits paid out to shareholders, a nice bonus for holding the stock.

Market Cap: The total value of all a company’s shares combined. A useful way to compare company sizes.

Day Trading: Involves buying and selling within the same day. It’s fast-paced and demanding.

Swing Trading: Involves holding stocks for days or weeks to profit from short-term trends.

Long Position: Buying a stock and expecting the price to rise.

Short Position: Selling a stock you don’t own, hoping the price will drop so you can buy it back cheaper.

Risk-Reward Ratio: Balances potential losses and gains, with a 1:2 ratio meaning risking $1 to potentially make $2.

Diversification: Spreads investments across different stocks or sectors to reduce risk.

Leverage: Borrowing money to trade bigger, amplifying both gains and losses. I use it cautiously.

Margin: Money borrowed from a broker to buy stocks. Helpful but carries real risks.

S&P 500: Tracks 500 of the largest U.S. companies and is a good measure of the overall market.

Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA): Tracks 30 major companies and has a more traditional focus.

Nasdaq: Heavily tech-oriented, featuring companies like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon.",TSLA,Tesla

2024-12-08,19:17:55,trading,Portfolio Talk,"Hello all, after months of my own research I've made a portolio. I want to preface this by saying this is not a post looking for advice. I am just wanting to tell you all the investments I've made and the reasons behind them. Also, there is some overlap between my individual picks and my ETF picks. I know.

**First, the foundation**

Like any smart investor you need a solid base. Something that will grow steadily and won't make you want to sell out when there is an inevitable market crash. This is why for my first pie, I have gone with 80% VUAG and 20% IGLA.

**Tech Focus**

People may say that my portfolio is too heavily weighted towards the USA and tech, I think the tech giants like Apple etc are not going anywhere. So my allocations are as follows,

Amazon- Moving into the AI space with Nova, Revenue growing steadily YOY.

Microsoft- Almost in the 'too big to fail' category. Not going anywhere and an easy choice IMO.

Alphabet- Recovered well and quickly after 2022 crash. Massive AI player. Easy choice

Apple- Still most popular in the Phone space. Can only see this stock going one way.

Meta- Absolutely flying in recent years. Hopeful Zuck will keep it up.

ASML- Riskier pick but believe they will have a good year next year. Looking 4-5 years into the future with this one.

Nvidia- Don't think I need to say too much with this choice. Looking long term, very excited about this one.

IonQ- Main player in quantum computing space, looking at some volatile years upcoming but I have faith that they could be huge in 5+ years.

**Consumer Focus**

Costco wholesale- Almost unshakeable business model, no strong competition IMO.

Pets at home- Smaller allocation for this one. Seems undervalued to me as people are always going to treat their pets. Will keep tabs on this one as still unsure.

Procter and Gamble- Been around for a million years. Very stable with dividend growth YOY.

Walmart- Consumer powerhouse in USA, strong financials and IMO not going anywhere,#

**Finance Focus**

Berkshire Hathaway- Trust in Buffett, no pressure from short term market trends.

Intuit- Dividend growth YOY, in an incredible place financially.

JP Morgan and Chase- In the 'too big to fail' category in my opinion. Involved in so many industries so not dependent on one for revenue.

MasterCard- Very able to adapt to the market, only risk is inflation IMO.

PayPal- After share price crash in 2022. Revenues didn't faulter and net income bounced back within the year. Undervalued IMO.

S&P Global- Adapting well to new tech such as AI. Been around forever.

**Real Estate Focus**

Realty income- Unshaken by the market crashes in past 20 years. Dividend Growth YOY.

VICI properties- Predictable revenue due to triple net leases. In a strong financial postion.

Personally, I have experienced significant success in investing, achieving returns of over 100% on a few occasions, though this was limited to four or five instances. Conversely, I have incurred losses exceeding $2,300 in Minute Trading with ES ""Futures SPY Minis."" Due to my struggles with futures trading, I have decided to refrain from it, as I found myself lacking the necessary patience. The financial stakes involved, such as $12.50 per tick and $125 per handle, were daunting, and I felt that the micro contracts did not align with my trading style. I was inclined to treat the ES as a gamble rather than a trade, as the potential profit of $25 to $50 on significant moves did not seem worthwhile. 



Currently, I have recently ventured into options trading, having started on October 2, 2024. Although my experience in this area is limited, I am optimistic about my progress thus far. I recognize that this positive trend may not be sustainable, but I remain hopeful. My journey in trading began in 2019, starting with a $300 course.

2024-10-12,23:53:51,trading,Why NVIDIA (NVDA) is Likely to Hit $150 Soon,"NVIDIA (NVDA) has been enjoying a wave of positive momentum, driven by several major developments in its AI and chip businesses. Over the past week, multiple reports have highlighted the strong demand for NVIDIA’s AI chips, particularly the next-generation Blackwell GPU, which is already sold out for the next 12 months. This demand is a key indicator that NVIDIA's AI dominance will continue, pushing the stock higher.

Morgan Stanley, after meeting with NVIDIA executives, reaffirmed a bullish outlook, projecting a 12% upside based on surging demand for AI inference computing and NVIDIA’s ability to provide increasingly sophisticated GPU solutions to major players like Microsoft and Meta. The firm has maintained its ""Overweight"" rating and sees the stock hitting $150 by the end of the year​

In addition to these developments, NVIDIA's continued innovation in AI energy efficiency and its robust partnerships with companies like Foxconn are also boosting market confidence. With AI poised to revolutionize industries, NVIDIA's leadership position in AI hardware places it in an excellent position for further growth. These factors suggest that NVDA could easily reach or surpass $150 by the end of the year.

# Aroon Indicator for NVDA shows an upward move is likely

NVDA's Aroon Indicator triggered a bullish signal on October 11, 2024. Tickeron's A.I.dvisor detected that the AroonUp green line is above 70 while the AroonDown red line is below 30. When the up indicator moves above 70 and the down indicator remains below 30, it is a sign that the stock could be setting up for a bullish move. Traders may want to buy the stock or look to buy calls options

In this time I've lost 3 1000 USD cryptocurrency accounts, been liquidated for $3000 trading TSLA after being up $6000 (and not taking profit), I've lost about 2000 on miscellaneous positions. That means through timing the market, I've made back about $8000. The largest position size I've held for stocks is $9000. The biggest gains I've had were 1300 on Bitcoin, twice and 650 from TSLA.

2024-10-11,17:48:01,trading,The Dow’s Surging,"2024 has been a wild ride for the markets. We've seen tech stocks taking a hit, while traditional financial giants like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are soaring. And then today, the Dow breaks an all-time high, shooting up more than 300 points. Big bank earnings are driving this rally, but something’s been nagging at me.

While JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are basking in the spotlight, Tesla’s been struggling—down 8.1% after rolling out their robotaxi. It’s got me wondering: Is the market getting too hyped on the banks while brushing off some of the underlying risks?

Sure, JPMorgan beat earnings expectations and raised its annual forecast. Wells Fargo? Another 5.6% gain. But when you zoom out, there’s still a lot of uncertainty hanging over the economy. The Fed's potential 25-basis-point rate cut in November could be the cushion these banks need, but it’s not a guaranteed win.

Honestly, I can’t help but wonder—am I missing something here? The Dow's on a winning streak, and major banks are leading the charge. But with mixed inflation data and the tech sector’s rocky performance, should we be more cautious?

I’d love to hear your thoughts. Are the banks really as bulletproof as they seem right now? Or are there risks we’re not seeing in this rally?",TSLA,Tesla

I trade supply and demand on the 15 minute time frame. Last week I took one trade because it was the only setup I got that hit all my confirmations. I am wondering what I can do to be able to take more trades. Here's what I do to find a good trade:

1. Look for aggressive buying or selling
2. Look to see if price is in an uptrend or downtrend depending on the direction of the aggressive move. (Ex: look for an uptrend if there is aggressive buying.) Then create a supply or demand zone using the previous candle or group of candles depending on how big the candles are.
3. Wait for price to come back to the zone. Price must come back gradually and not aggressively.
4. Look for some kind of confirmation that the price will go in the desired direction. This can be an engulfing candle, a hammer or a morning/evening star pattern.
5. Enter after I receive conformation. If taking a demand trade, set stop loss at the bottom of the demand zone. If taking a supply zone, set stop loss at the top of the supply zone. Set take profit at the high/low of the aggressive move or set TP to where I get a 2:1 ratio.

2024-09-22,18:52:00,trading,Webull: Is There a Better Way?,"Morning all,

I’ve been interested in investing many years now.

Eventually I put some money together right before the pandemic and opened a RobinHood account.

I had nothing to compare it to and at that time I was just “investing”, so I didn’t see any problems with it. Simply
put I had no expectations.

Fast forward 2-3 years a good friend gets heavy into TSLA and options.

When I was trading on Robinhood back in the day I became aware of options but had trouble understanding them.

Anyway, the past year talking to my friend he explained them to me and I got the hang of it and the importance of charting, candles, levels, the whole 9 yards.

Then as he was still learning himself he kind of ran out of things to teach me so I ended up immersing myself in learning about charting and the technical analysis. My major was economics and I work in business so I had a pretty strong understanding of economics and the market generally.

I eventually read a bunch, Martin J Pring’s 800 page ‘Understanding Technical Analysis’ was especially helpful, as was investopedia.

Anyway my friend invited me to Webull told me its the shit so I said why not.

After a month of getting the hang of it, using the papertrade feature, and just generally getting comfortable and configuring it how I wanted I dropped some money it.

Things are going well but I have two issues.

1. I’d like to have one Roth type brokerage account elsewhere and then daytrade/swingtrade out of the other one.

2. I’d prefer to not use a Chinese app.


After doing a lot of research based on reviews I narrowed it down to the following:

Fidelity
IBKR
Etrade
ThinkorSwim
Moomoo (I know, more chinese)

What I’m looking for is something comparable to Webull’s really fantastic UI, charting tools, and its superb integrated access to company financials. It also has customizable screens, watchlists, and has yet to bug out on me. I also make 5% on my cash balance. My options fees under 500 contracts are also free, whereas on the US brokerages the norm seems to be 0.65 per contract.

I downloaded TOS and it’s pretty awkward compared to Webull, especially the charting, and although it does kind of work its tedious af; however I can chart on webull or other software if need be. 

Downloaded E-trade and again, while not as strong as Webull its more intuitive than TOS at least.

I checked out the reviews for Fidelity on the app store and they were almost universally  extremely negative.

IBKR, while getting slightly better reviews (from places like NerdWallet) still got quite awful reviews from users in the app store, especially in regards to filling option orders and something about only being able to do simple calls and puts, not condors, straddles etc.

I have yet to try MooMoo (but again, would like to go with an american firm).

I may have to default to RobinHood for my investment account, and can use other apps for advanced research and charting.

What are you guys thoughts?
What are you using?",TSLA,Tesla
2024-09-21,04:48:42,trading,"If you had trillions to manipulate a stock price, wouldn't you make huge on options?","How does it work?
If I could make CVNA tank by shorting 9999999 shares, wouldn't that be easy money if I also bought puts?
Is there enough liquidity to pay me via options this way?
How does it work?

I always assume I could spend $500million calls/puts on AVGO for example, and be able to get paid.
But maybe not on RDFN.  TSLA AAPL of course.

Update:
I guess same thing with buying shares... Maybe just outright bought the company the price shoots sky high, but so do my calls.  Can't say you ran out of shares to borrow short, since we're playing long.  The calls are ITM and the market must buy from you.",TSLA,Tesla

2024-09-06,10:33:43,trading,Research and detailed analysis on High Tide inc ( $HITI : Nasdaq),"**Background** - How [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) became the leading cannabis retailer in Canada

**The beginning**:

Raj Grover, the founder and CEO who owns \~9% of the company and has never sold a single share (not even when it was trading 5x higher than it is today), comes from an entrepreneurial family and had already experienced success with several smaller businesses before establishing [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click). During a business trip to India in search of opportunities in fashion accessories or body jewelry, Raj stumbled upon the potential of cannabis consumption accessories. Recognizing the margin arbitrage opportunity, he shipped $10,000 worth of consumption accessories from New Delhi to Canada and sold everything overnight. After replicating this success a few more times, Raj decided to open a store. **This marked the beginning of High Tide's story**.

In 2009, Raj opened Smokers’ Corner with an initial investment of less than $50,000 and grew it into a multimillion-dollar empire. At that time, there were only two or three competitors with unappealing stores. Raj believed that by creating a differentiated store in a smart location, he could easily capture market share, and he was right. By leveraging his established roots in Indonesia, Thailand, China, and India, he was able to not only provide a better customer experience but also offer much cheaper products.

**Cannabis legalization in Canada**:

Always looking to stay ahead, Raj seized the opportunity when the Prime Minister of Canada announced that recreational cannabis would soon be legalized. With an existing customer base of cannabis users, it made perfect sense for Raj to expand into selling cannabis itself. He realized that if he only sold accessories, he would eventually lose customers to shops that offered both cannabis and accessories.

After nine years of focusing on consumption accessories and accumulating nearly $10M in retained earnings, Raj raised $88.5M for the first time in 2018 and ventured into the equity markets, marking **the beginning of High Tide's journey as a publicly traded company**. With easier access to capital when compared to its peers, High Tide expanded its footprint across Canada, highlighted by the significant acquisition of its competitor Meta in 2020, which increased the number of stores from 37 to 67.

**The strategy shift that made everything change**:

Around the same time, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) began acquiring e-commerce businesses selling accessories and CBD-related products (mostly oils) with higher margin profiles, **a pivotal decision for the company**. From acquiring several brands in the U.S., such as Smoke Cartel, FABCBD, Daily High Club, DankStop, and NuLeaf Holdings, to later acquiring BlessedCBD in the UK, High Tide leveraged its market power to **enhance margins** and diversify its revenue streams.

In the summer of 2021, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) was accepted for listing on the Nasdaq, marking a significant milestone.

Later that year, a transformative decision was made: **High Tide launched a discount club model for its retail stores in October 2021**. With consolidated margins higher than any competitor due to the previously mentioned CBD-related acquisitions, High Tide could offer cannabis at remarkably low prices, **attracting loyal members and rapidly gaining market share**.

https://preview.redd.it/tjo9dducg5nd1.jpg?width=857&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=676e37c264e375403a5ec047b0ebdd72cd0ac091

Although this discount model initially involved selling cannabis at a loss, **the move proved to be incredibly successful**. High Tide's market share increased from less than 4% to over 10% in less than three years, despite representing less than 5% of the total cannabis retail store count. **Today, the discount model program has more than 1.5M members and continues to grow each quarter**.

Being the first-of-its-kind discount model was the key differentiating factor that propelled High Tide to become the leading cannabis retailer in Canada. **No competitor could match their prices**, and Raj targeted cannabis users who consumed regularly and were highly price-sensitive.

When I first started investing in High Tide, one of its closest competitors was Fire & Flower Holdings, which ultimately went bankrupt following this price war. There are many more examples of competitors that went bankrupt following this (Four20, Tokyo Smoke, etc), showing how strong [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) has become in the sector. And the consolidation of the market in Canada is just starting.

This strategy also significantly diminished the illicit market, further strengthening High Tide’s market share.

https://preview.redd.it/rsvb5mzgg5nd1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14676a13c867ba7ddfbe2d3ac16d6f0d882cec02

**After capturing market share, it was time to turn profitable**:

While Raj sacrificed margins to achieve this, economies of scale and several initiatives aimed at improving margins allowed [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) to become **positive free cash flow** again in 2023 (\~8% margin as of last quarter), as well as **positive net income** in the most recent quarterly results, with a consolidated leadership position stronger than ever.

Overall, **High Tide took a calculated risk to become the leader in the country**, and it proved to be incredibly successful. This success was only possible due to the CEO's extensive experience in the sector and deep understanding of the cannabis consumer, surpassing that of any other management team.

https://preview.redd.it/ple0anwhg5nd1.jpg?width=606&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b43d0e9cca1a1a00b7faac93c80ba208742cf5c0

  
**What's next for** [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)**?** - The best is yet to come.

While the focus on becoming FCF+ led to a notable deceleration in revenue growth, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) **is now returning to its high-growth strategy**.

Despite cannabis being legal for over five years, there's still significant market potential to capture in Canada.

A recent regulatory change in Ontario now allows one company to operate up to 150 recreational cannabis stores, doubling the previous cap of 75. This change is benefiting large retail chains like [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click). Raj Grover has outlined plans to open 20-30 stores this year (already opened 20 so far), capitalizing on the opportunity and targeting the high presence of the illicit market in the region.

Moreover, the Canadian market is experiencing significant consolidation, allowing High Tide to expand its market share organically and through acquisitions at depressed multiples. For example, High Tide recently acquired a store for 1.5x last quarter's annualized Adj. EBITDA. The CEO mentioned in the last earnings call that he's in negotiations with a sizable player to acquire additional stores, aiming to accelerate its footprint expansion and surpass this year's initial target.

Every month there are dozens of cannabis stores closing in Canada because they simply can't compete with [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click).

Over the next two years, High Tide is expected to reach a 15% market share, up from 10.9% today.

https://preview.redd.it/twdhbkjjg5nd1.jpg?width=743&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9672f9f35929fce7c390f6482b79bcc69713c543

It's worth mentioning that Raj and his team have always been methodical in selecting store locations, ensuring each one yields significant returns, which is why the annual revenue per store at [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) surpasses the industry average by a wide margin.

Over the next three to five years, there's **potential to reach an annual revenue of $1B in Canada alone**.

[$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is one of the very few cannabis companies that **does NOT depend on any new legislation** to keep growing and improving its bottom-line numbers.

Ongoing developments in the U.S. might give [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) the green light to expand there.

Significant changes are on the horizon for the U.S. cannabis sector. The potential rescheduling of cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III could open doors for U.S. cannabis companies to list on major exchanges like Nasdaq or NYSE, making it easier for institutional investors to get involved. **The only reason High Tide hasn't entered the U.S. market yet is to avoid compromising its Nasdaq listing**, so this would finally open doors for the Canadian leader.

Note: For those who don’t know, U.S. cannabis companies can’t be listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq, only on the OTC markets. Since [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) only sells cannabis in Canada (and only sells CBD products or consumption accessories in the U.S.), there’s no issue. This is also one of the reasons why institutional ownership in the sector is so low.

High Tide, with its vast e-commerce base of over 3M U.S. customers and profitable operations, is poised to leverage these developments. Raj Grover’s strategic approach as a second mover allows him to avoid pitfalls and strategically open stores in key states. The company is ready to capitalize on its strong foundation and scale efficiently, aiming to secure significant market share with well-chosen locations and a clear expansion strategy.

Most U.S. operators struggle to turn a profit even with gross margins in the 40-50% range, while [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is both FCF and net income profitable with a gross margin below 30%.

While **the company doesn’t depend on the U.S. market to continue growing**, this presents an additional catalyst for its upcoming growth trajectory.

Regardless of whether this expansion happens quickly or not, these developments will attract a wave of new investors to the sector and contribute to an overall expansion in multiples.

High Tide is becoming the **Costco of Cannabis**

After the success of its free discount model, which gathered over 1.5M members in under three years, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) launched ELITE, **a paid membership with even better offers**.

The rollout began slowly, but **membership is now growing at a record pace** — 226% YoY and 38% QoQ last quarter.

It's worth noting that this growth is happening while the subscription price is being raised.

Although the absolute number is still relatively small, at 46,000, the conversion rate of regular club members to ELITE ones is getting better every quarter. You only need to make a small purchase for the membership price to pay for itself, it's exactly like [$COST](https://x.com/search?q=%24COST&src=cashtag_click).

The long-term vision is for High Tide to be the [$COST](https://x.com/search?q=%24COST&src=cashtag_click) of cannabis, **driving strong and predictable cash flows and strengthening High Tide's competitive edge**.

I believe this is one of the catalysts that will help [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) further improve bottom line margins.

https://preview.redd.it/nwg6zu86h5nd1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9aff8dbd6960087b23524e17e47dfb928fd7322e

  
Despite being a retailer with relatively low margins, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)'s gross and FCF margins (\~8% as of last quarter) have **room to grow**.

Cannabis prices in Canada are just starting to stabilize, and [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is waiting for full market stabilization before aggressively launching white labels. While many independents are closing and the market is consolidating, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) isn’t raising prices yet to avoid aiding competitors. **The long-term strategy is to leverage pricing power gradually**.

When I asked the CEO if [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)'s FCF margins are nearing a peak, the response was clear: No, **there are still many growth opportunities**. As the market consolidates and [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)'s market share increases, they anticipate further improvements in both gross and FCF margins, plus new areas to explore with scale and other initiatives.

https://preview.redd.it/vueight7h5nd1.jpg?width=870&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9326f53f89559feb4834092c30d7ba0d8b348c0b

  
**Valuation** - [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is the most superior cannabis business, yet the cheapest.

Retail investors in Canada alone have lost over $130B since the 2017 bubble popped, so I understand why everyone is wary of this sector.

But I have demonstrated how [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is different from the most well-known cannabis companies like [$CGC](https://x.com/search?q=%24CGC&src=cashtag_click), [$TLRY](https://x.com/search?q=%24TLRY&src=cashtag_click), [$ACB](https://x.com/search?q=%24ACB&src=cashtag_click), and others. **High Tide generates strong FCF and has a track record of consistently impressive execution**.

Most importantly, it has a highly aligned management team that cares about shareholders, which is rare in the sector.

The fact that this sector is at its peak of pessimism is what makes it possible for us to buy [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) at such a cheap valuation.

It's also worth mentioning that, unlike the other names mentioned, High Tide went public late in the game and was not part of the bubble in 2017-2018. That's why it is so underfollowed and why most people don't even know about it.Let's check the numbers.

[$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) generated CAD $22.7M in FCF over the last 12 months, so it is currently trading at 10x LTM FCF. It's worth noting that this was the first full year of FCF profitability, so this number should improve further from here.

But since most cannabis companies are not FCF-positive, let's use EV/EBITDA as a proxy.

[$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is trading at \~5x its NTM Adj. EBITDA, while the average for [$MSOS](https://x.com/search?q=%24MSOS&src=cashtag_click) is \~7-8x. Importantly, its Adj. EBITDA from these last 12 months increased 82.7% from the previous year. It's mind-blowing that it can trade at such a low multiple.

The disparity is even larger when we look at other Nasdaq-listed cannabis stocks. For instance, [$TLRY](https://x.com/search?q=%24TLRY&src=cashtag_click) is trading at almost 20x, [$ACB](https://x.com/search?q=%24ACB&src=cashtag_click) at the same, and [$CGC](https://x.com/search?q=%24CGC&src=cashtag_click) isn't even EBITDA-positive.

[$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is **the best-performing cannabis company** and one of the very few that is already generating both FCF and net income, **yet it remains the cheapest**.

Faster growth + better margins + a superior management team + a winning business model + the lowest valuation = **a complete bargain**, at least in my view.

While most investors are avoiding this sector due to the well-known companies that destroy shareholder value, I'm taking advantage of this opportunity by investing in what I consider a hidden gem.

The recent acquisition of Nova Cannabis by [$SNDL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SNDL&src=cashtag_click) at a low valuation multiple might have highlighted how undervalued [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is. Nova Cannabis was one of the few competitors to High Tide, but under [$SNDL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SNDL&src=cashtag_click)'s ownership, it has lost direction. This acquisition occurred at an EV/TTM Revenue multiple of 0.55-0.6, while [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click), a more established and superior business, was trading at 0.4x. Similarly, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)'s EV/TTM Gross Profit multiple of 1.4x contrasts sharply with Nova's 2.4x. This disparity indicates that [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is undervalued, and the market is beginning to recognize this.

2nd - Following the news that the DEA has scheduled a hearing on the marijuana rescheduling proposal after the U.S. election, causing the entire cannabis sector (including [$MSOS](https://x.com/search?q=%24MSOS&src=cashtag_click), [$CGC](https://x.com/search?q=%24CGC&src=cashtag_click), etc.) to drop significantly, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click)'s performance remained strong. Despite the sector-wide double-digit decline, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) has maintained a notably higher value compared to its pre-news levels. This resilience suggests that [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is too cheap to ignore, and the market is catching on.

https://preview.redd.it/evasmoy9h5nd1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b04e53f448f15424d6b66eba43619420f27c75d

  
Before finishing, I'd like to highlight this:

[$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) has **less than 10% institutional ownership**, while over 75% of the market is owned by institutions.

**Peter Lynch often talks about this**. If you want to achieve multibagger returns, find a hidden gem before the institutions do.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

News: [AT&T Says New Hack Includes Records of Customer Calls, Texts ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-12/at-t-says-new-hack-includes-records-of-customer-calls-texts)

We saw the markets sell off yesterday due to the CPI news, think we’re going to have a relatively flat day today.

[**TSLA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) - We saw TSLA delay their Robotaxi Event from August to October, watching for some form of bounce in the stock. Currently long, but will remain agile (as usual) if we selloff at the open.

[**NVDA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d) - We also saw this turn more strongly than the other Mag7 stocks because of the close to 20% move we saw it make in the past week. No opinion on this yet, but watching for a setup.

[**SNOW**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d) - AT&T ($T) had their customer data illegaly downloaded from a workspace on a third-party cloud platform (identified as SNOW’s). Might be user error/social engineering (not sure) rather than a cybersecurity issue, so we might see a reversal of this move at the open. However, it should noted that there were no multifactor authentication safeguards in place in previous hacks of SNOW.

[**JPM**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JPM&p=d) - Reports $4.40 vs $4.19 expected EPS. NI at $18B was up 25% from the same period a year ago due to exchange of shares in Visa that provided $8B in gains.

**TSLA-** Same thesis as yesterday, has been on a tear for the past few days- still have bearish bias. Trading out of line with Mag 7 (which is expected due to car sale numbers), but will be looking for appropriate places to short if they occur.) If we spike off the open then I’ll try to be agile and short/cover where appropriate.

**AMZN-** Took advantage of the CPI spike and exited out half of part of my AMZN position, will hold rest back to a stop at 199. Other than that, still holding half. We DID open at a lower low today (but that can partially be attributed to CPI). Will likely remove this after today.

2024-06-12,06:20:04,trading,Thoughts on nvda,"### High Demand for NVIDIA's GPUs

#### Key Drivers of Demand

1. **Product Development and Computational Tasks**:
   - **Chatbots and AI**: Companies use GPUs to power AI models for chatbots, virtual assistants, and other natural language processing (NLP) applications. The computational power of GPUs is essential for training and running these models efficiently.
   - **Scientific Research**: High-performance computing (HPC) tasks in scientific research, such as simulations and data analysis, heavily rely on GPUs for their parallel processing capabilities.

2. **Self-Driving Technology**:
   - **Autonomous Vehicles**: GPUs are critical in processing the vast amounts of data from sensors and cameras in real-time to make decisions for self-driving cars. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and others invest heavily in GPU technology for their autonomous vehicle programs.

3. **Robotics**:
   - **Industrial Automation**: Robotics in manufacturing and logistics use GPUs to handle complex tasks, including real-time image recognition, object manipulation, and path planning.
   - **Service Robots**: From healthcare to hospitality, service robots rely on GPU-powered AI to interact with humans and perform tasks autonomously.

4. **Race Towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**:
   - **Major Tech Companies**: Companies like Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft are in a race to develop AGI. This requires building and training extremely large neural networks, which demand substantial computational resources provided by GPUs.
   - **Market Advantage**: The first company to achieve AGI could gain a significant market advantage, driving intense competition and further increasing the demand for high-performance GPUs.

### Implications for NVIDIA

#### Market Position

- **Leadership in GPU Technology**: NVIDIA is a leader in the GPU market, known for its continuous innovation and high-performance products. This positions NVIDIA well to meet the growing demand across various sectors.
- **R&D Investment**: NVIDIA’s investment in research and development ensures it stays ahead of competitors and continues to deliver cutting-edge GPU solutions.

#### Potential for Growth

- **Revenue Increase**: The diverse and expanding applications of GPUs suggest sustained and potentially increasing revenue streams for NVIDIA.
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborations with tech giants, automotive companies, and research institutions can further boost NVIDIA’s market presence and revenue.

### Considerations and Risks

1. **Supply Chain Constraints**:
   - **Manufacturing Capacity**: Meeting the high demand may strain NVIDIA’s manufacturing capacity, potentially leading to supply shortages and increased prices.
   - **Component Shortages**: Global semiconductor shortages can impact the production of GPUs, affecting supply and pricing.

2. **Competitive Landscape**:
   - **Rival Technologies**: Competitors like AMD and Intel are also advancing their GPU technologies, which could impact NVIDIA’s market share.
   - **New Entrants**: Emerging companies in the AI and semiconductor space might introduce innovative products, increasing competition.

3. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**:
   - **AI Regulations**: As governments develop regulations around AI and autonomous systems, compliance could affect development timelines and costs.
   - **Ethical Implications**: The race towards AGI raises ethical concerns, including safety, job displacement, and privacy issues, which could lead to public and regulatory scrutiny.

### Investment Perspective

Given the diverse applications and high demand for GPUs, particularly NVIDIA's products, the company is well-positioned for significant growth. However, potential investors should consider the risks associated with supply chain constraints, competition, and regulatory changes. A balanced investment strategy, possibly including a diversified portfolio of tech stocks, can help mitigate these risks while capitalizing on the growth potential in the GPU market.",TSLA,Tesla

Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities.

This is a daily watchlist for trading.

I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.

I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.

Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question.

At the end of each tax year, I update my investments to the current top 6 market cap companies.  The strategy is very hands-off and has worked well for me over the years, beating the S&P 80% of the time, on average by around double.   

However, I have been doing a lot of research over the last 6 months or so in relation to trading, back testing, coding pine script etc.  I an looking at ways to increase my annual return on these investments and see the reduction of draw-down as being potentially one of the more beneficial ways of doing this.  

I was therefore wondering if anyone knew of any reasonably reliable methods of doing this.  e.g. selling my META position following a death-cross and buying back in following a golden cross etc.  I appreciate this is like asking for a crystal ball answer, but any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers).

I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones.

* Unveil dates for Tesla products do not guarantee a near-future commercial release, as seen with the Tesla Semi truck unveiled in 2017 but only starting deliveries in 2022.

Samsung: Tech giant sees profits jump by more than 900%

Say for example I want to long ETH/USD and I want to risk 0.5% of my account. The trade setup on Tradingview shows I need 1.52 quantity of ETH. So 1.52 divided by 100,000 equals 0.0000152... which I cannot punch into Metatrader. The lowest I can go is 0.01. The only way I could get to that is by seriously jacking up the risk of my account?

2024-02-09,14:54:40,trading,09/02 Premarket Report - Everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket as SPX breaks 5k.,"**ANALYSIS:**

* We broke 5000 in premarket, which means that we are currently trading above the call resistance. Premarket trading isn’t the best indicator of true price action due to the lack of volume. So when the market opens, we will want to see SPX consolidate above the 5000 level. It will likely retest this level so we just need to see if it holds above. 
* We can start to see some more call interest building at 5050 and 5100 now as we approach monthly OPex. 
* We can see that here: 
* [https://imgur.com/a/yhA4dcp](https://imgur.com/a/yhA4dcp) 
* And with a different visualisation here: 
* [https://imgur.com/a/k49BUH6](https://imgur.com/a/k49BUH6) 
* We have shown before that the money flows into SPX reached new highs. Here is a different visualisation of this, from Nomura, which shows that asset managers are basically really really long on this market. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/gYRSZ6t](https://imgur.com/a/gYRSZ6t) 
* Look at the Skew on the Mag 7. 
* Very very strong, not looking like any pullback right now on the big boys.
* [https://imgur.com/a/rWu04dp](https://imgur.com/a/rWu04dp) 
* Money flows in SPX remain strong , we are seeing some signs of possible hedging by traders in QQQ. 
* The gamma is very very high again today, which tells us that again volatility should be slightly surprised, although we will have the CPI revisions released, which will be interesting if they show some hawkish surprises. Note the last revisions data did indeed lead to dollar strengthening and Yields rising. If we do get that kind of move higher, we will likely see some pullback as traders hedge going into CPI print next week.
* See the institutional research section to read about Morgan Stnaley’s prediction for the CPI next week. 
* IWM lastly, Trading above a key gamma level, skew points higher on 1 month expiration and 1 year expiration. Traders expect bond yields to fall and IWM to break higher. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/jKEvfek](https://imgur.com/a/jKEvfek) 
* Yes market positioning does still look bullish on this market, but I do want to share with you an alternative analysis from Goldman Sachs here. 
* Goldman note that “we are now seeing extremely bullish options activity in the collective Mag 6 names. This is something that we have seen 5 other times in the post covid era (looking back 3 years). WE note that if you look at forward returns after this occurrence, the 2-4 week forward return is negative”.
* We can see that in this graph below. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/3pvrKge](https://imgur.com/a/3pvrKge) 

**GAMMA LEVELS TO WATCH: - plot these on your charting platform so you can track the price action against them.**

* SPX trading at 5013
* These are the key gamma levels:
* Gamma level at 5025
* My quant says max of the day expected to be 5031
* 5000 remains tech all resistance 
* Gamma level at 4975 below that,
* My quant says expected min of the day if we go that low is 4965. That marks the lower bound of the expected trading range today and we can expect a bounce from here. 
* QQQ:
* Call resistance remains at 440
* Myq quant says upper trading bounce of today will be 436.95
* Gamma level at 436 too.
* 435 is where the 0dte Call resistance is
* Below spot, key gamma level is at 430. 
* Below this, my quant says min of the day expected to be 429. That’d mark the bottom of the trading range if we were to fall that far. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* US CPI Revisions - markets will be looking to inform their thesis for the timing of the first rate cut. 
* This comes ahead of CPI next week. 
* Last time, the 2022 revisions showed that inflation progress wasn’t so great, which made yields jump and the dollar jump. 
* Fed’s Logan speaks later though

———  
 **INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH:**

* With CPI next week, let’s take a look at Morgan Stanley’s CPI prediction:
* [https://imgur.com/a/VdlgdWC](https://imgur.com/a/VdlgdWC) 
* They expect CPI decelerated to 0.26% MOM in January, below consensus of 0.3%
* Said they think core services was sideways and good decelerated. Energy prices will drop headline to 0.14%
* Bank of America’s put out mapper saying that Stock Rally close to triggering Sell Signal.

* JAPAN’s Nikkei is at 34 year highs. Broke 37k for first time in 34 years. This comes as Ueda said that easy monetary conditions will persist even if BOJ scraps negative interest rate policy.

This is something that we have seen 5 other times in the post covid era (looking back 3 years). WE note that if you look at forward returns after this occurrence, the 2-4 week forward return is negative”.
* We can see that in this graph below.

**GAMMA LEVELS TO WATCH: - plot these on your charting platform so you can track the price action against them.**

* SPX trading at 5013
* These are the key gamma levels:
* Gamma level at 5025
* My quant says max of the day expected to be 5031
* 5000 remains tech all resistance 
* Gamma level at 4975 below that,
* My quant says expected min of the day if we go that low is 4965. That marks the lower bound of the expected trading range today and we can expect a bounce from here. 
* QQQ:
* Call resistance remains at 440
* Myq quant says upper trading bounce of today will be 436.95
* Gamma level at 436 too.
* 435 is where the 0dte Call resistance is
* Below spot, key gamma level is at 430. 
* Below this, my quant says min of the day expected to be 429. That’d mark the bottom of the trading range if we were to fall that far. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* US CPI Revisions - markets will be looking to inform their thesis for the timing of the first rate cut. 
* This comes ahead of CPI next week. 
* Last time, the 2022 revisions showed that inflation progress wasn’t so great, which made yields jump and the dollar jump. 
* Fed’s Logan speaks later though

———  
 **INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH:**

* With CPI next week, let’s take a look at Morgan Stanley’s CPI prediction:
* [https://imgur.com/a/VdlgdWC](https://imgur.com/a/VdlgdWC) 
* They expect CPI decelerated to 0.26% MOM in January, below consensus of 0.3%

2024-01-25,14:05:22,trading,I'm a professional news driven trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing from premarket 25/01 including analysis of Tesla and more.,"To support more analysis like this, please join r/Tradingedge as well as r/Trading. 

**ANALYSIS:**

* Yesterday we hit 4900 like a brick wall and got rejected, a lot of algorithmic selling from that point brought us lower. 
* Looking at today vs yesterday, we can see that the call resistance still sits at 4900, it hasn’t rolled up yet to 4950 or above. We want to see the roll up of call resistance for us to be more bullish. 
* In fact, after 4900 got rejected yesterday, we can see that traders bought a fair bit of Puts 0DTE. On February expiration, we can see calls on 5000 and 4950 got sold, and puts got bought. So positioning bit worse, but still bullish. Money flows are strong. 
* If we look 0dte we can see big walls at 4880 as 0dte call resitance and 4845 as 0dte put resistance. These will act as sticky strikes, but obviously they are just 0dte so they can be broken by strong volume from GDP data. 
* QQQ positioning more or less as it was. Call resistance still at 430, which will act as a wall. 
* IWM we are seeing some selling of calls, as bond yields push higher. 
* Note that positioning today will be subject to the GDP print. A big surprise in either direction will clearly impact the market, as it will impact bond yields, dollar, and the chance of rate cuts. 
* We showed yesterday that the probability of March rate cuts has been directly driving dollar price action, and in turn the equity market. 
* We can see from the chart below that the reduction in rate cuts being priced was what directly correlated to the equity sell off. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/ZpQZLXO](https://imgur.com/a/ZpQZLXO) 
* Vix is pretty much sleeping at this point, so this is a good thing to watch as the number of rate cuts being priced and equity markets are moving inversely.   

* Furthermore, Tesla will weigh on Nasdaq a bit today. The report wasn’t great. Pointing to lower volume is not what investors want to be hearing, but that is mostly because their team is working on launch of next gen vehicle, or so they say. 
* I do think that we have to remember that the stock was trading at 260 at the start of the year. It’s already down 27% on that. I do think Tesla goes lower but I am not as pessimistic as other people on Reddit and social media.   

* A quick look at China, because China announced more supportive measures, this time for the property sector. 
* Call volumes on China are flying, after the announcement of stimulus measures this week. We can see that below. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/ZpHWjGN](https://imgur.com/a/ZpHWjGN) 
* I did look at the option profile for FXI, and saw a fair bit of selling of puts at 21. Positioning is looking much better. 
* Mainland investors aren’t chasing this rally though, but area actually selling it. Whilst we can see more of a squeeze here, and I am long China so I want to see that, I do think we need to see mainland investor sentiment shift before we see sustainable rally forwards.
* Along with the improved positioning on China, we can see AUD risk reversal points up.  
 Traders fully expecting 0.67 right now, as stimulus in china helps Australian trade. 

**DATA LEDE**

* IFO Report for Germany:
* Business climate was 85.2, lowest reading in a year and missed expectations.
* IFO expectations also came in light, and at the lowest level in over a year. 
* We can see the weakness visualised here:
* [https://imgur.com/a/GAYfHpW](https://imgur.com/a/GAYfHpW) 
* This report reiterates the growing weakness in Germany.   
 
* ECB Interest Rate decision. Expect the ECB to walk back some of thier dovishness. This hawkishness could push EUR higher.  

* Jobless claims and US GDP growth 
* Expectation for GDP is fora moderation to the more usual 2% vs last quarter’s anomalous 4.9% 
* Also watch the durable goods orders, expected to be 1.1%.

—————

**MARKETS:**

* SPX: yesterday, got rejected at 4900. Pulled back sharply due to algorithmic selling to 4866. 
* Today in premarket has been moving slightly higher, to 4873. 
* NASDAQ:
* At 17,520. Reached 17,670 yesterday, before pull back to 17.450. Recovered slightly in premarket, but mostly flat. 
* DJI: Rejected from above 38k yesterday. Fell back to 3780. More or less flat in premarket. Did move higher but has come down in last hour. 
* HKG50: Slightly higher again, trading at the high fo the day yesterday at 16,200.
* Led higher primarily by property stocks which jumped as Beijing is taking more measures to try to boost the real estate sector. 
* Chinese EV didn’t participate after Tesla earnings.   
  
* China call volumes are exploding after the news on stimulus. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/ZpHWjGN](https://imgur.com/a/ZpHWjGN) 
* Ger40 slightly lower, Rejected just above 16900, fell back to 16,810. Slightly lower ahead of ECB meeting where Lagarde expected to be somewhat hawkish 
* Bond yields: slightly lwoer this morning, ahead of GDP but mostly elevated 
* Oil - Was higher yesterday, as US crude inventories showed a big decline, much more than expected. That distorts supply demand imbalance in favour of higher prices. Also we saw Russian seabourne crude shipments drop to 7 week low. Still, oil price flat ahead of GDP numbers. 

**FOREX:**

* EURUSD: Flat ahead of ECB meeting and GDP numbers from US, got rejected at 1.09

2024-01-20,17:29:34,trading,Converting multipliers to lot,"I'm going to be very specific so you can understand me well.

There's a broker, called Deriv (deriv.com), you can sign up, create a live/demo account and start trading, this broker has his own phone app (Deriv Go) and it also supports MetaTrader 5, this is where my question comes in. 

If I trade in MT5, I get to choose lot size (up to 50) and make my calculations based in lot size, however, if I trade from the app, I have a multiplier (up to 400x).

My question is, how do I make the exact same trade in both? What's the common factor? What are the parameters in both lot size and multiplier that will allow me to have a profit of, let's say, $50 in 120pips?",META,"Meta Platforms, Inc."

2024-01-15,13:30:34,trading,"AAPL, TSLA, NVDA: What positioning data tells us to expect for price action in Short term.","**AAPL:**

**Look at the skew below:**

[https://imgur.com/a/7Fszu74](https://imgur.com/a/7Fszu74)

Despite the bounce in equity prices, skew never really pointed higher. Sentiment remains subdued around AAPL. Negative analyst downgrades continued last week, putting pressure from week before.

Main option volume is buying OTM put options. Traders expect price to fall.

Gamma wall at 180. Call resistance at 200. Other gamma level at 190. Likely rngebound in 180 to 190.

**TSLA:**

We can see that the break of 220 has sent skew lower. 220 was a key level. next key level down is 200 which is the put support. 210 also a big strike and will be in play.

[https://imgur.com/a/q5h18n5](https://imgur.com/a/q5h18n5)

Call resistance moved down from 250 to 233.33 which is not bullish.

Positioning got worse on Tesla, but notice the orange line> money flows remain bullish. Hedge funds din't sell, still holding their positions long. I guess they expect recovery in medium term.

Main options im seeing are puts on 210. Fully expect 210 to hit maybe even 200.

200 game wall is massive though and can expect a bounce from there.

&#x200B;

**NVDA**:

Look at the skew below:

[https://imgur.com/a/aDg8NFJ](https://imgur.com/a/aDg8NFJ)

Skew index moving lower on both weekly and monthly. IV in OTM call options decreasing, which is causing volatility.

People re selling calls, will likely pullback.

Main calls being sold are 560.

Call resistance remains at 550, strong gamma level at 500, which it cn bounce from. below that, is 450 put support.
