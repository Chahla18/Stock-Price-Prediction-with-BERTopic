2024-01-05,What is the difference in profits from penny stocks compared to expensive stocks if they both went up by 10 in a month in share value and you have invested the same amount in both Edit solved answered. Thanks New to trading. So I don t know if this question even makes sense. So here s the scenario If a penny stocks company increases it s shares value by 10 in 1 month. And if a big company like Tesla increases it s shares value by 10 in 1 month. And I ve spent 100 in both. Shouldn t my return profit be the same Won t I have 110 end of month in both scenarios Even if their shares value are very different the percent increase is the same. So my return on investment is the same So apart from the potential for quick big percentages increase why isn t it a good idea to spend the same money on a big company which is always increasing it s value every year instead of up and down like most penny stocks Thanks in advance,reddit,0.9923,0.236,0.0,0.764,0.10869067162275314,0.024921158328652382,0.866388201713562,positive,neutral

I m thinking instead of VTSAX invest the mega backdoor contribution into VOO for a little bit of variety or maybe 75 VOO and 25 into individual stocks .

2024-01-11,20 yr with low expenses in HCOL area Been working since I was 18 and started investing little by little middle of 2023. Opened up a webull taxable account with at first just a few Tesla shares then I learned about different stocks and hold a variety of companies I think are solid and I did end in the green although I didn t take profits. As title suggests I live with my parents in the California Bay Area and would like to stay here and I m pretty frugal cuz I basically have everything taken care of for me besides paying my dad $250 as my rent and occasional car expenses. He intends to essentially give back what I ve paid over the years as well. So anyways I ended up with over 50k in my taxable account in stocks in 2023 and only a few I regret slightly but just wondering since my objective is to grow this money to afford a townhome house here in the bay in like 6 8 years is this the right route for me opposed to putting in an ira or saving all income with 5 apy I don t need this money yet but I need it sooner than 65,reddit,0.8462,0.072,0.016,0.913,0.06582163274288177,0.01918366365134716,0.9149946570396423,positive,neutral

2024-01-15,AAPL TSLA NVDA What positioning data tells us to expect for price action in Short term. AAPL Look at the skew below Despite the bounce in equity prices skew never really pointed higher. Sentiment remains subdued around AAPL. Negative analyst downgrades continued last week putting pressure from week before. Main option volume is buying OTM put options. Traders expect price to fall. Gamma wall at 180. Call resistance at 200. Other gamma level at 190. Likely rngebound in 180 to 190. TSLA We can see that the break of 220 has sent skew lower. 220 was a key level. next key level down is 200 which is the put support. 210 also a big strike and will be in play. Call resistance moved down from 250 to 233.33 which is not bullish. Positioning got worse on Tesla but notice the orange line money flows remain bullish. Hedge funds din t sell still holding their positions long. I guess they expect recovery in medium term. Main options im seeing are puts on 210. Fully expect 210 to hit maybe even 200. 200 game wall is massive though and can expect a bounce from there. NVDA Look at the skew below Skew index moving lower on both weekly and monthly. IV in OTM call options decreasing which is causing volatility. People re selling calls will likely pullback. Main calls being sold are 560. Call resistance remains at 550 strong gamma level at 500 which it cn bounce from. below that is 450 put support.,reddit,0.4404,0.044,0.044,0.913,0.015562007203698158,0.9396237134933472,0.044814273715019226,positive,negative

2024-01-16,Tesla stock grab ultimatum I just saw this on CNN and may be the first time I ever heard of something like this. Elon Musk is demanding he have his voting power doubled in the company. This after he sold huge chunks such as to finance buying Twitter. In a series of posts on X Monday night Musk said that he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25 of the company s stock. That would be about double the roughly 13 stake he currently owns. I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI robotics without having 25 voting control. Enough to be influential but not so much that I can t be overturned Musk wrote in a post on X. Unless that is the case I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla. So the 2nd block he s essentially threatening to spin off and make competition. But how does a public company address this If they awarded him some GIGANTIC options it would massively dilute existing shares. If they made another voting class of shares x20 000 voting rights they could just give a small pile of those but what Board could transfer 12 voting interest in a public company based on some tweets How would that be upholding their corporate responsibilities Is this some insider key to the sell off they ve been experiencing Cuz it s frankly scary to me. And it s scary because I think he might get it. Which does a lot to undercut the trust I have in the Board. I had been thinking of doing an option on them if they dropped to maybe 200 205. But this is just an ugly ultimatum that seems capable of vastly changing the value of the company. OR am I blowing things out of proportion I admit I don t follow the company religiously and for all I know musk makes a post like this every month.

2024-01-16,What industries are you most bullish on this year Also what stocks ETFs are you buying right now to hold long term I m paying close attention to a small number of industries in 2024 ranging from oil tankers to food supply chain track trace however lithium is at the very top of my watchlist. The lithium supply chain will be within the blast radius of massive tailwinds as the demand for lithium will continue growing at an expedited rate with a compound annual growth rate of 12 to 20 . EV s are the obvious lithium catalyst driven by strict adoption mandates across the EU US and Asia. For context on this a Tesla model S battery contains around 62.6 kg of lithium and roughly 2 billion EVs need to be on the road by 2050 for the world to hit net zero emissions the demand growth potential of lithium industry is something unprecedented. There s not much to compare it with and no it hasn t been priced in . Also let s not forget the impact of global relations on lithium and other base metal supply chains. We re seeing a repatriation of the manufacturing base back to the western world which in this case will favour domestic and near shore lithium projects . I m currently placing my long term bets in the industry and am bullish on a small number of stocks $ALB My safety net play One of the biggest lithium juggernauts rn with an extensive global portfolio. They hold the title of largest provider of lithium for EV batteries in the world. Albemarle is on a path of industry consolidation via aggressive M A . $LIFT.V My parabolic growth play One of the most robust early stage lithium projects I ve come across in Northern America. If you know anything about junior miners you know how drill test results play a key role in assessing the potential value of a company stock. I recommend reading into these. Just by looking at publicly available drill hole data I believe we could see a total resource of 60 million tonnes which would mean and estimate 1 1.4 million tonnes LCE resource. . For context anything worth 1million tonnes is likely to attract major institutional capital. Does anyone else share by bullish outlook What are your 2024 lithium metals bets $ALB $LIFT,reddit,0.9836,0.102,0.016,0.882,0.21406923234462738,0.011678340844810009,0.7742523550987244,positive,neutral

2024-01-17,Apple and Tesla may no longer be safe investments as China s troubles grow From Marketwatch China represented a 19 chunk of Apple s revenue in 2023 and roughly 22 for Tesla in the first nine months of last year. This makes them the two most China exposed companies of the Magnificent Seven. Apple recently cut handset prices in the China where it battles competitors like Huawei. Tesla also reduced EV prices in the country where Berkshire Hathaway owned BYD rules. From Peter Navarro former White House trade adviser under President Donald Trump Like GE before it Apple and Tesla now have this grim mercantilist reality. Because Mr. Cook and Mr. Musk each directed the offshoring of the vast bulk of Apple s and Tesla s production to China the companies are at the mercy of a merciless dictator in Xi Jinping he writes. China is also in the midst of population woes and a stagnating economy. With US sanctions fears adding fuel. From Barrons We expect the sequential growth momentum of the Chinese economy to stabilize at a subdued level over the course of 2024 with annual growth slowing to 4.4 in 2024 as the reopening effects fade the property sector remains a drag and government policies focus on containing downside risks rather than providing a major growth boost wrote Julius Baer economist Sophie Altermatt in a research note on Wednesday. Shaky consumer confidence and concerns over China s demographics the population shrank for the second year in a row in 2023 are bad news for the e commerce operations that big Chinese technology companies have built their businesses on. EDIT Crikey guys I m just quoting news to hopefully enrich this sub. But the articles pick on the two most fan fave companies and the debate I m seeing sounds a lot like cheerleading.

2024-01-18,20 stocks till 2049 buy and hold for 25 years Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community. I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ. The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long term experiment created by Thomas Gayner chief executive of Markel Group. So I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold. So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1 2049. Here is my list so far. 1. Amazon Google Microsoft Apple 2. Costco 3. Johnson and Johnson 4. Waste Management 5. CVS 6. Home Depot 7. Boeing 8. Caterpillar 9. GE Aerospace 10. Intel Micron Nvidia 11. Walmart Target 12. Starbucks McDonalds 13. UPS 14. JP Morgan Bank of America 15. Berkshire Markel 16. Disney 17. Tesla GM 18. Hershey 19. Dollar General 20. Lockheed Martin Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years from this list the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully after 25 years the winners will dominate. Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list. Edit Some really good points in the comments. 1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment 2. Since all of these are mature large companies maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case what would you pick,reddit,0.9796,0.108,0.025,0.867,0.032536253333091736,0.030962824821472168,0.9365009665489197,positive,neutral

2024-01-19,No one knows anything Here s How Barron s Stock Picks Performed and Why We Trailed the Market Investors who avoided the tech stocks known as the Magnificent Seven last year were almost guaranteed to underperform the market. Unfortunately Barron s writers only picked one Tesla The magnificent seven returned 112 on average last year versus a 12.5 gain for the other 493 names in the S P 500 Those omissions proved costly on the scorecard of Barron s 2023 stock picks. The 77 companies featured in bullish articles returned 9.9 on average from the date of publication to the end of the year. Their benchmarks returned 12.7 from the same dates. The two bearish picks featured in the magazine moved in opposite directions for an average gain of 30.2 . William Goldman famous screenwriter and novelist wrote a book on his life in Hollywood with the tag of no one knows anything. This was directed at studio execs who couldn t predict flops or hits or who would be a star and everyone was often wrong on their guesses. I was impressed that Barrons came out and showed their abysmal stock picking record and how if you blindly put your money in the leaders you would have crushed the so called experts.

2024-01-20,Just how big are the Magnificent Seven This is a big quote from MarketWatch. I ve seen the numbers before but this really gave me pause. These captains of the SS S P 500 are Google parent Alphabet Amazon Apple Facebook parent Meta Platforms Microsoft NVIDIA and Tesla. They ve been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me there s a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S P 500 s valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65 of the Index s market cap gain last year despite comprising just 1.4 of its components. But doesn t this go against the main reason behind investing in S P 500 index funds Wouldn t the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed Phil Van Dorn Well I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry traditionally you might be looking at expenses of 1 of assets under management per year and that can really pile up over time. But with an S P 500 Index Fund your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires Club a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30 of the S P 500 depending on which day you look at it. Jeremy Owens Right so that s seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S P 500 moving forward knowing how much these companies matter Phil Van Dorn One can say that there s a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1 of the S P 500 but make up close to a third of its value. However the S P 500 is self correcting. It rewards success.,reddit,0.9859,0.11,0.041,0.849,0.06369545310735703,0.07033129036426544,0.8659732341766357,positive,neutral

2024-01-21,NVIDIA 2023 Q4 earnings projections Meta and Microsoft each purchasing 150 000 GPUs. Those two companies were responsible for 300 000 units with the other 200 000 going to the rest Oracle Tencent Google and Amazon Tesla TickTok Baidu Alibaba. Q3 reported revenue was 18 bills. The reported 500k number seems to be true. Now the question is who will be ordering another 500k batch in Q4 so that at least the Q4 result won t pale in comparison and won t be a disappointment for investors META to the rescue As Zuckerberg stated which means they might order another 200k from Nvidia or he may find 2 x H100 equivalent to compute to avoid paying a premium over generally specialized Nvidia GPUs and buy more specialized and power to output optimized ASICs chips like Google s TPUs. I don t think other big tech giants will order more GPUs because running a general purpose GPU is very expensive Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU. Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family. Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren t willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run. And want to diversify to other chip makers like AMD Intel and specialized ARM makers. Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon Microsoft and Google cloud capacities . The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent. Their a moderate low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15 20 billion. A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion. Let s sidestep to AI marker TAM topic However this estimated revenue will be brought by those who rent AI processing capacities like AWS GCP and Azure cloud providers. And not ChatGPT clones. The market has not figured yet the TAM of services like ChatGPT. However I try to speculate on which have stagnated for the last 6 months. 100 million monthly active users 10$ per subscription produces 1 billion in revenue. A single user runs 2 000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot. 2000 0.04 80 $ to service 1 user per month. Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month. No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription. It doesn t seem sustainable. Last note the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4 5 years. So if AI expectations won t burst and chip efficiency improves 10 fold and other chip makers won t catch up don t expect big tech to re stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.,reddit,0.9899,0.111,0.03,0.859,0.14068785309791565,0.056981708854436874,0.8023304343223572,positive,neutral
2024-01-21,Mutual Fun for my 3yo Son So for my son s first birthday I thought it would be fun to invest $1K and see where it would be when he turned 21. I asked all of his relatives to pick any stock or whatever and then I bought fractional shares to spread out the $1K. I have a record of each initial stock purchase price . Others played it safe and picked mutual funds. Anyway the purity of the initial $1K is gone because I ve added more money as people have given additional monetary birthday gifts etc. So now I have an imbalanced mishmash. I ve been putting the new money in safe places specifically VOO SPY and BRKB. The total is still only about $2K but over the next 18 years I expect to continue to put modest amounts in and I am curious what people think.

2024-01-24,Is China set for finally bottom and an epic rally DISCLAIMER This post can disturb US readers What a f value evaporation we went through in the last years. China with the bad press from the US major media and subsequently Markets realigning with US policy left the stock market in the lows. You have companies like $BABA that IPOed at $68 per share on Sept. 14 2014 and last week this thing was touching that price. But let s compare BABA business and valuation quickly In Millions 2014 2023 Revenues 52 504 RMB or $8 463 868 687 RMB or $126 491 Profits 23 403 RMB or $3 720 156 906 RMB or $22 583 Share Price 119$ 70$ When China was friendly to the US eyes the share price of BABA peaked at $300 and I remember that still it was considered a value play compared to its peers China has disappointed the market with news and I beleive not a single news can disspoint investors further other than a very extreme US hollywood driven wet dream of China invading Taiwan Their economy is still doing better than ours in europe or the US but they aren t active participants of press releases conference meeting for the front page of Financial Times or election year where US population take it as a sport match. BYD took over TESLA. eCommerce in China and South Asia is BABA Tencent playground moving trillions They were the first to release 5G and subsequently US had to take them down with some drama story on Huawei China state intervened their high growth sectors and companies bcuz their CEOs thought that they could monetise on Chinese publicly funded resources and create an oligopoly equivalent to the US where Googles Amazons dominate the citizens privacy freedom and life. An order has been implemented where they will still exist but won t cross lines with their algorithms as happened on our side we are sorrounded by fake news extreme division teenagers suicide rate very high adults depressed and anxiety etc... That story is over I believe China is set to rally and this is the bottom .

2024-01-25,Where to read about small cap companies Tesla Microsoft Apple among many other top companies were once small on the stock market and pretty insignificant in the market. There were few people that were able to jump on early to invest. I understand that many small cap companies will be doomed to fail but what are some sources places where I can read about companies like that today I think back in the day people relied more on conventional media like newspapers and journals but these days such information news is a lot more scattered. What are some more consolidated sources where I can read about smaller companies on the stock market whereby I can determine for myself the growth potential of the company. EDIT I just want to clarify that my intention with this post is not to find the next small company that is going to boom. My goal here is to try and be able to find a reputable source that is better able to inform me on what smaller publicly traded companies are doing future plans. I may invest but I want to be able to be well informed on such companies. Back in the day the answer to this might have been WSJ or NYT but I am not confident that those are the best sources in the current day and age.,reddit,0.9478,0.11,0.04,0.85,0.06550707668066025,0.02171827107667923,0.9127746224403381,positive,neutral

2024-01-25,I m a professional news driven trader and this is everything I m watching and analysing from premarket 25 01 including analysis of Tesla and more. To support more analysis like this please join r Tradingedge as well as r Trading. ANALYSIS Yesterday we hit 4900 like a brick wall and got rejected a lot of algorithmic selling from that point brought us lower. Looking at today vs yesterday we can see that the call resistance still sits at 4900 it hasn t rolled up yet to 4950 or above. We want to see the roll up of call resistance for us to be more bullish. In fact after 4900 got rejected yesterday we can see that traders bought a fair bit of Puts 0DTE. On February expiration we can see calls on 5000 and 4950 got sold and puts got bought. So positioning bit worse but still bullish. Money flows are strong. If we look 0dte we can see big walls at 4880 as 0dte call resitance and 4845 as 0dte put resistance. These will act as sticky strikes but obviously they are just 0dte so they can be broken by strong volume from GDP data. QQQ positioning more or less as it was. Call resistance still at 430 which will act as a wall. IWM we are seeing some selling of calls as bond yields push higher. Note that positioning today will be subject to the GDP print. A big surprise in either direction will clearly impact the market as it will impact bond yields dollar and the chance of rate cuts. We showed yesterday that the probability of March rate cuts has been directly driving dollar price action and in turn the equity market. We can see from the chart below that the reduction in rate cuts being priced was what directly correlated to the equity sell off. Vix is pretty much sleeping at this point so this is a good thing to watch as the number of rate cuts being priced and equity markets are moving inversely. Furthermore Tesla will weigh on Nasdaq a bit today. The report wasn t great. Pointing to lower volume is not what investors want to be hearing but that is mostly because their team is working on launch of next gen vehicle or so they say. I do think that we have to remember that the stock was trading at 260 at the start of the year. It s already down 27 on that. I do think Tesla goes lower but I am not as pessimistic as other people on Reddit and social media. A quick look at China because China announced more supportive measures this time for the property sector. Call volumes on China are flying after the announcement of stimulus measures this week. We can see that below. I did look at the option profile for FXI and saw a fair bit of selling of puts at 21. Positioning is looking much better. Mainland investors aren t chasing this rally though but area actually selling it. Whilst we can see more of a squeeze here and I am long China so I want to see that I do think we need to see mainland investor sentiment shift before we see sustainable rally forwards. Along with the improved positioning on China we can see AUD risk reversal points up. Traders fully expecting 0.67 right now as stimulus in china helps Australian trade. DATA LEDE IFO Report for Germany Business climate was 85.2 lowest reading in a year and missed expectations. IFO expectations also came in light and at the lowest level in over a year. We can see the weakness visualised here This report reiterates the growing weakness in Germany. ECB Interest Rate decision. Expect the ECB to walk back some of thier dovishness. This hawkishness could push EUR higher. Jobless claims and US GDP growth Expectation for GDP is fora moderation to the more usual 2 vs last quarter s anomalous 4.9 Also watch the durable goods orders expected to be 1.1 . MARKETS SPX yesterday got rejected at 4900. Pulled back sharply due to algorithmic selling to 4866. Today in premarket has been moving slightly higher to 4873. NASDAQ At 17 520. Reached 17 670 yesterday before pull back to 17.450. Recovered slightly in premarket but mostly flat. DJI Rejected from above 38k yesterday. Fell back to 3780. More or less flat in premarket. Did move higher but has come down in last hour. HKG50 Slightly higher again trading at the high fo the day yesterday at 16 200. Led higher primarily by property stocks which jumped as Beijing is taking more measures to try to boost the real estate sector. Chinese EV didn t participate after Tesla earnings. China call volumes are exploding after the news on stimulus. Ger40 slightly lower Rejected just above 16900 fell back to 16 810. Slightly lower ahead of ECB meeting where Lagarde expected to be somewhat hawkish Bond yields slightly lwoer this morning ahead of GDP but mostly elevated Oil Was higher yesterday as US crude inventories showed a big decline much more than expected. That distorts supply demand imbalance in favour of higher prices. Also we saw Russian seabourne crude shipments drop to 7 week low. Still oil price flat ahead of GDP numbers. FOREX EURUSD Flat ahead of ECB meeting and GDP numbers from US got rejected at 1.09 GBPUSD Flat ahead of GDP numbers from US at 1.273 AUDUSD Flat below 0.66. Yesterday it pushed up then pared most of the gains as dollar recovered and China pulled back. Risk reversal on AUD is higher. Stimulus from China is boosting optimism. Traders expect 0.67 to hit. DXY at 103.2 103.8 is the key level to break on upside ahead of GDP. EARNINGS TSLA EARNINGS Headline numbers Revenue at 25.17B missed exp by 2.8 . 3 year CAGR slowed to 33 from 38 last quarter and 60 2 quarters ago. EPS of 71C missed by 2.8 .

Cars produced was 495k 15 sequential growth and 12 YOY growth Deliveries were 484.5k 11 sequential growth and 19 YOY growth. Not great but positive is that GPM ex credit beat estimates by 1.5 . That s tea auto revenue and leasing margins. Input costs continue to fall Costs fell YOY from 39k to 36k this quarter. Input cost disinflation helps them. Tesla starts advertising to build brand awareness. Still one experimentation phase. Seems to be working since 90 of 2023 customers were brand new to Tesla. Model Y was best selling car in 2203. Solar business contracts sharply due to higher costs making it more expensive which hurts demand. This is not Tesla s main driver so not problem. FSD Version 12 will be released to customers in weeks ahead Volume growth will be notably lower in 2024 than 2023 they said. that s because their team is working on launch of next gen vehicle at Texas Musk said. Tesla said that 2024 vehicle volume growth may be notably lower in 2023. Said cyber truck deliveries are to ramp up throughout the year. Will be over 125k this year. Said if rates fall quickly in 2024 then that will be good for margins if not then margins won t be good. Plans to start production of next gen vehicle platform in H2 of 2025. Said they are very far along in development. Commentary from earnings call Musk said many companies don t believe FSD is real Musk said Tesla is an AI and robotics company not car company expects hardware related profits to be accompanied by acceleration of Ai and software based profits. TESLA ALSO POINTED TO COMPETITION FROM CHINESE EV FIRMS saying they will demolish rivals without trade barriers. Note A Year ago analysts expected Tesla to make over $7 in profit per share in 2024. Now the earnings estimates are just $3.7 yet the stock is at the same price. This is a sign over the overvaluation of Tesla right now. SERVICENOW EPS of 3.11 beat by 11 Revenue of 2.44B was up 26 YOY beat by 1.6 Subscription revenues grew a lot at 27 and accounts for 97 of revenues.

2024-01-26,Long on TSLA equity waiting for another dip Thinking of holding a long position on Tesla if the price drops to 150. It s a bit of a gamble but their new model being released in 2025 will have better profit margins than the sway of declining margins in the EV industry and Musk potentially gaining 25 of voting rights whilst semi autocratic could help them catch up in AI or specifically robotics which seems to be slightly neglected in the AI race and VC funding. The bet on Tesla to be a robotics leader is the biggest gamble however they need to do something to justify their tech valuation because at the moment their primary source of profit stems from automobiles and as opposed to previous predictions they will not have a monopoly over this industry when the EV revolution is realized. If the price drops to 150 I ll probably take a position based on the premise that the valuation is more justified and that there is potential for exponential growth in robotics,reddit,0.972,0.133,0.021,0.846,0.25880664587020874,0.031395141035318375,0.7097982168197632,positive,neutral

2024-01-28,Any advice on what to invest in at 18 So far I have read a few books about investing whether that s in 401k Roth mutual funds stocks royalties etc. I know of them but not in detail. I currently work a main job making 19 hr I m also doing a few side hustles working a second part time job and running a business on the side. My plan is to put away 20 or more of my paycheck away into investments but I don t know what exactly. I want as many assets as I can get while still being able to survive. I want to hit the 10k month mark and then put more than 20 down but maybe even open a new business increasing my assets. Any advice for what to look into next Maybe even investing into real estate,reddit,0.6124,0.048,0.0,0.952,0.03958733379840851,0.024367805570364,0.9360448122024536,positive,neutral

2024-01-31,Lift Power Ltd Unlocking A Promising Junior Miner Li FT Power Ltd. is a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition exploration and development of lithium pegmatite projects located in Canada. A pegmatite is an igneous rock created underground when interlocking crystals form during the final stages of magma. According to The Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy Canada is the only Western nation with abundant cobalt graphite lithium and nickel all involved in producing electric vehicles. While Canada can provide the United States with many of the critical minerals it needs to execute its green transition the United States can in turn provide capital to develop Canada s capacity to mine and process essential minerals further. There are over 1000 semiconductor chips in the average EV. The preceding proves that you need lithium exposure. Doubtful A typical EV battery has about 8 kilograms of lithium 14 kilograms of cobalt and 20 kilograms of manganese. However this can often be much more dependent on the battery size a Tesla Model S battery for example contains around 62.6 kg of lithium. As a bonus most battery and critical metals producers usually have healthy doses of other minerals such as gold. If you want quality junior investment exposure read on. Li FT Power Ltd. is a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition exploration and development of lithium pegmatite projects located in Canada. A pegmatite is an igneous rock created underground when interlocking crystals form during the final stages of magma. As mentioned LIFT shares an excellent proxy for critical minerals in EV batteries etc. are great traders for those with that bent. It is not unusual for the shares to swing CDN0.50 a day. If you are a trader it ensures you keep a core position. Depending on where you get your investment news Baystreet.ca or Barchart LIFT is on the list of stocks to know own for 2024. Yesterday the Company announced more impressive results. The following is a shameless grab from the Jan 2024 PR. The Company reports assays from 8 drill holes completed at the Fi Main BIG West Nite Ki pegmatites within the Yellowknife Lithium Project located outside the city of Yellowknife Northwest Territories . Drilling intersected significant intervals of spodumene mineralization with the following highlights Highlights YLP 0148 23 m at 1.40 Li2O YLP 0182 11 m at 1.38 Li2O YLP 0145 10 m at 1.28 Li2O and 3 m at 1.26 Li2O YLP 0149 5 m at 1.04 Li2O and 1 m at 1.04 Li2O and 10 m at 0.78 Li2O including 5 m at 1.15 Li2O Should you want to view historical results go ahead and visit the LIFT site. Further there is an excellent summary at Katusa Research. They can say it way better than I do. And it is only a couple of days old. From Katusa Car companies are biting their nails due to shrinking lithium supply to demand Remember this deposit has a lithium containing rock that can be seen on the surface . Now it s drilling down 200 300 meters and determining how big this project is. We re hitting on 80 90 of our drill holes the CEO says. This means 80 90 of drill tests locate more lithium. By mid 2024 Li FT should know how much lithium they re holding. When you hear about car companies partnering up with mine now Ford pre purchased one third of the output of a lithium mine in 2022. GM invested over $650 million bucks into a lithium mine in 2020. Volkswagen seeks to create what former CEO Herbert Diess has called a full ecosystem of suppliers from lithium extraction to the assembly of batteries in Spain. Car companies are biting their nails due to the shrinking lithium supply to demand. As I said while the above highlights are good they are just the most recent among other historical essays. Check them out. Why LIFT Lithium intercepts are one thing. LIFT s most I would go out on a reasonable limb and say that if LIFT is already a big deal it is well on its way. A 52 week trade range of CDN4.00 to CDN11 shows the interest already. Management owns over 50 of the shares and bought with their money. One put in CDN15 million.

Li FT Power s CEO Francis MacDonald shows off this lithium rock he picked up in the NorthWest Territories Canada.. Owned by Li FT Power For most lithium companies around the world they dig dozens if not hundreds of meters into the earth s crust to find this rock. Not the one this man is holding. This specific rock not only contains some of the highest grade lithium around this rock could be picked up right off the ground. Yes like any old pebble In fact there s over 158 400m2 area of land that is bursting with this rock. So much so there are kilometers of it just sitting on top of the earth. It s so large Just look for yourself on Google Maps You can see this lithium deposit from this aerial view. See those white specks stretching over 2 kilometers That stuff can power a Tesla and it s there for the taking. This unique project in the Northwest Territories Canada is called The Yellowknife Lithium Project. Discovered in the 1970 s but hidden from the world until today Once owned by ExxonMobil in the 80s it s sat dormant and relatively untouched for the last 36 years. Until now. When a successful gold finder from the $47B Newmont Mining company Francis MacDonald stumbled on a major arbitrage in the lithium market. Due to his experience in gold mining he knew you needed 500 000 1.5 million meters of drilling to start a gold project. And the costs are enormous. For copper mining it s 200 000 1 million meters of required drilling. For lithium It s only 50 000 meters of drilling . That means less money time and effort to find out how much metal is in the ground. Not only that there are already over 536 active gold producing mines running right now. Active producing lithium mines A paltry 54. That s not enough. At the moment there are 1. Record breaking demand for electric vehicles ... and lithium ion batteries. Plus 2. A looming lithium shortage to hit as early as 2025 according to CNBC. Francis took his geology and mining knowledge and founded Li FT Power. The company is only two years old while potentially sitting on a fascinating lithium deposit in North America. Li FT Power trades publicly on the US OTCQX LIFFF Li FT s a company bursting with lithium potential Literally coming out of the ground. Li FT currently is drilling to discover how much lithium is here Why hasn t Yellowknife been drilled for lithium if it could be one of the greatest deposits in North America Extracting any resource from gold to copper to lithium takes Time to permit and develop the mine site Money to do so Companies like ExxonMobil and individuals barely touched Yellowknife for almost a century as lithium wasn t as profitable to get out of the ground. Only recently have EV sales picked up lithium prices soared and then stabilized and the demand for lithium ion batteries taken off. It s only now as we face geopolitical risks and coming lithium shortages does it finally makes sense to put more shovels into the ground. That s the opportunity Li FT Power and its founders see. Over 50 of the outstanding shares of Li FT Power are owned by the founders and early investors. Early Li FT investors poured in as much as $15 million dollars EACH into the company to acquire the Yellowknife Project and start defining how much lithium is in the ground. That money hasn t gone to pay out bonuses or waste. Francis the CEO is plowing most of the cash into fast tracking Yellowknife by drilling to determine HOW MUCH lithium is there. Remember this deposit has lithium containing rock that can be seen on the surface. Now it s drilling down 200 300 meters and determining how big this project really is. We re hitting on 80 90 of our drill holes the CEO says. Meaning 80 90 of drill tests locate more lithium. By mid 2024 Li FT should know how much lithium they re holding. When you hear about car companies partnering up with mines now Ford pre purchased one third of the output of a lithium mine in 2022 GM invested over $650 million bucks into a lithium mine in 2020 Volkswagen is seeking to create what former CEO Herbert Diess has called a full ecosystem of suppliers from lithium extraction to the assembly of batteries in Spain We ll need 78 new mines by 2035 to accommodate total demand But few mines are under development and existing mines are not scaling up lithium production. Also lithium mines take 10 years to bring online. So if the mine is not already under development it s too late. Which is why massive shortfalls are already being predicted. Under the best case scenario the lithium shortage in three years will be as much as the entire demand was in 2022. To avoid the impending crisis EV manufacturers are taking matters into their own hands. In a rare move they re getting involved in lithium mining itself. What s unfolding is an escalating no holds barred brawl for lithium supply. Consider Volvo which is talking with the biggest mining companies in the world about buying a stake in their operations. Not for a profit but just to have access to lithium. Volkswagen s CEO Scott Keogh echoes this sentiment We are not going to become a mining company. But certainly we will get significantly closer. Or Ford which pre purchased 33 of the lithium output of a new mine in Nevada last year. A few months after that GM invested $650 million in a lithium mine also in Nevada. GM Director of Purchasing Tanya Skilton predicts that the industry will be divided into winners and losers Companies with minerals for electrified dreams will succeed. The rest are toast. It s after feasibility this type of investor interest really picks up both with the stock AND the potential vendors who desperately need more high grade lithium. Why Once Li FT discovers how much lithium they can get and the way to extract it economically companies and investors start watering at the mouth. An example is Tesla was rumored to be in talks to buy Sigma Lithium the massive lithium project in South America for around $3 4 billion. That company kept updating their feasibility and reserve size to be bigger and bigger Tesla was interested to pounce. How big is the potential lithium motherlode inside Yellowknife NOTE Modelling a deposit has a lot of variables and risk. And that s the job of seasoned analysts to determine. Tesla was interested in buying Sigma Lithium as mentioned. Today Sigma is a $4 billion dollar lithium company in Brazil. Their entire business centers around their one lithium project Grota do Cirilo. The mine s already up running and producing as they started working on it in 2012. Sigma s Grota do Cirilo is estimated to hold between 85 and 100 million metric tonnes of lithium in their mine. What about Yellowknife According to Francis the CEO He and his team are more than halfway through drilling to determine the actual tonnage. Sigma is further along and now producing up to $450 million in free cash flow from their lithium output. Sigma s stock skyrocketed over 1 350 as lithium demand and prices soared Of course past returns are no guarantee of future returns. Taking a further look LIFT s Yellowknife lithium deposits are in yellow and Sigma s Groto do Cirolo deposits are in green both at the same scale on these maps. Let s look at another major lithium discovery Patriot Battery Metals... 2.5 years ago they were worth around $10M. Today they re a $1.25 billion dollar company but haven t pulled an ounce of lithium out of the ground yet. Patriot Battery Metals project is called Corvette. And it s currently heralded as one of the largest lithium mining deposits in the Americas. They show 109 million metric tonnes of lithium ore. The project is still years from producing lithium revenue worth over $1 billion they ve simply defined how much lithium they have in the ground. Li FT Power aims to have a resource estimate done in the next 8 months and will be able to share their final numbers. If 100 million metric tonnes proves correct Li FT Power could end up with a significant lithium deposit in the Americas. The top 4 lithium projects in the Americas are owned by billion dollar companies as of this writing One large owner Albemarle is worth over $16 billion. They own multiple projects globally. Take a look Yellowknife has the potential to surpass the size of these billion dollar sites including its neighbor Patriot Battery Metals. Meaning two of the largest deposits in North America are quietly tucked away in Canada. Yet at the moment Canada is a rounding error on the total lithium producers in the world. Australia leads the pack in lithium production by a wide margin followed by members of the Lithium Triangle Chile and Argentina. Then of course China. Canada is not even at 3 while Australia reigns at over 46 . It s not a shock if Canada begins making strides higher especially in the mining space. Canada is already a top 5 producer of uranium diamonds gold platinum titanium and other resource metals. Mining is in its DNA. In Canada thanks to the Ice Age ending only 25 000 years ago the lithium deposits are easier to get to and not as damaged. The glaciers also polished the landscape making beautiful pristine deposits at the surface in areas like Yellowknife. Not only that Many Canadian suppliers are not affiliated with China China is a major geopolitical concern in the lithium space. A big reason being they got to the lithium first. Their quest for more EVs before global adoption meant they snatched up mines all over the world. China itself produces only 17 of the world s raw lithium. But it has managed to wrap its tentacles around every corner of the lithium market. It even has the lithium refining market cornered 65 of the world s lithium chemicals are produced in China. For example Australia produces about half of the world s raw lithium but it s almost all owned by China A Chinese lithium company owns a large stake in Greenbushes the Australian lithium reserve that is the largest in the world The second largest lithium reserve in the world also in Australia is underwritten by Ganfeng Lithium... a Chinese company. Nearly 60 of the world s known reserves of lithium can be found inside a triangle that intersects the borders of three countries Chile Argentina and Bolivia. The Lithium Triangle holds most of the lithium reserves and China owns a large chunk of the Ganfeng Lithium paid $4 billion to become the second largest shareholder in SQM the largest lithium producer in Chile. And in 2021 Chinese companies bought three major lithium mines in Argentina in deals worth $1.3 billion. Most countries are trying to get out from the stranglehold of China s grasp on the lithium market. China s main gig is that they own over 60 of the lithium processing capacity. Bloomberg projects they own up to 80 . Which is quite alarming That s on top of owning the actual lithium in the ground inside multiple countries. The battle for lithium comes down to access to the lithium ion batteries. That s why the US is also seeking alternative lithium supplies. We need more lithium ion batteries to power electric vehicles. An electric car battery has between 30 and 60 kilos of lithium. It s estimated that by 2034 the US alone will need 500 000 metric tons of unrefined lithium a year for EV production. That s more than the global supply was in 2020. And by 2030 Albemarle the world s largest lithium producer is projecting that 3.7 M metric tonnes of lithium will be needed. That s a lot of lithium needed By mid century some experts project EVs will be nearly 100 of the market supply for vehicles. Boston Consulting Group predicts electric battery powered vehicles will surpass combustion engine vehicle sales as soon as 2028. EV demand has picked up in just the last two years Whether you believe gas powered cars are on their way out or not there s no denying EV sales are shooting upwards at the moment. Everywhere you turn in North America there s a Tesla driving by. And the numbers in China are breaking new records If the U.S. meets its 2030 target there will be more than 48 million EVs on the road in just seven years. But it s not just the US trading in gas for lithium powered electrics Europeans just started buying a ton more EVs in 2021. EV sales have tripled in just three years. China beat other countries to the lithium punch early because they suck up more supply of EVs than anyone. More EVs on the road more lithium required. To create one singular lithium ion battery to power a Tesla you must process 25 000 pounds of brine for the lithium More is needed. The International Energy Agency an organization that tracks world energy usage says Demand for LITHIUM is growing faster than demand for any other metal or mineral They estimate that the global demand for lithium will increase more than tenfold by 2030 and potentially 50 times greater by 2040. Check out where the demand graph is at the moment We re in the early stages of lithium demand Meaning experts predict a near 4X increase in lithium demand. 73 of that today comes from EVs. Another block is energy storage. Keith Phillips CEO of Piedmont Lithium projects we need 40X more lithium by the end of this decade. That may be overstating but either way the supply crunch is set to begin as early as 2025. And the gap will only widen as time passes. We need more lithium being produced. Well there are large players out there. The biggest in the world own projects in the China heavy Lithium Triangle. However getting the product out of the ground and scaling it is a problem. The problem Big time companies like Albemarle aren t hard rock lithium mining they use a technique called brining. Brining is a process where instead of chipping away at rock and pulling out the lithium Brining pumps ungodly amounts of water into lithium deposits extracts the solution then dries out the water to get the lithium salt remaining. Here s the issue The brining evaporating cycle takes 2 years to complete In Hard Rock lithium mining you can pull the product out and it s commercial ready 6 weeks later. Yellowknife has hard rock lithium sitting on the surface ready to be processed. Little to no water evaporating is required. You can t scale brining operations without more land and tonnes and tonnes of more water. In Chile brining has caused severe droughts. In Northern Chile an entire river was dried out due to water extraction and evaporation. Rivers and lakes have disappeared one local told the news. To meet soaring demand We need more hard rock lithium miners. And with many countries turning their backs on Chinese operations... Canada has another opportunity to shine in the mining space. The lithium Project that could be at the center of it all It s called Yellowknife as mentioned. A Project you can see from Google Maps for yourself it s that obvious Yellowknife s owned by Li FT Power a two year old lithium mining company. Francis MacDonald the CEO has put together an expert team with multiple geologists and environmental officers. A top tier team for a top tier lithium asset. Insiders own 50 of the outstanding shares Currently the company is valued around $198 million as of this writing. They hold $18 million just in cash. The stock trades for a mere $4 under the ticker symbol OTCMKTS LIFFF. The goal is to continue to develop the Yellowknife project to become one of the top deposits in not just the Americas but also the world. Insiders still own 50 of the stock and aren t selling. Shares only went public in May 2023. Lithium prices currently sit at multi year lows. As we see a supply crunch with demand skyrocketing there s no telling how long lithium prices will stay this low. This low lithium price will discourage new lithium miners to develop. Meaning if competitors don t start now they won t be extracting any new lithium before 2030. That could exacerbate the supply problem even further. By then it s too late even if lithium prices rebound. An investor is better to position themselves before lithium prices go up again. . Investing in Li FT Power at just $4 is an easy way to gain exposure to lithium but also enjoy watching the potential unfold. Their next major milestone for investors is finishing their drilling in early 2024 then a feasibility study by mid 2025. Consider Li FT Power as a potential value play in the lithium mining space As a bonus Li FT Power also owns four other projects in Canada. Cali acquired with Yellowknife near the Yukon border Rupert located near the James Bay region of Quebec Pontax located also near the James Bay region Moyenne accessed via helicopter also located in James Bay All 4 of these bonus assets are in pre production. Most funding is going towards Yellowknife.,reddit,0.9991,0.075,0.041,0.884,0.04715761914849281,0.040608663111925125,0.9122337698936462,positive,neutral

2024-02-09,09 02 Premarket Report Everything I m watching and analysing in premarket as SPX breaks 5k. ANALYSIS We broke 5000 in premarket which means that we are currently trading above the call resistance. Premarket trading isn t the best indicator of true price action due to the lack of volume. So when the market opens we will want to see SPX consolidate above the 5000 level. It will likely retest this level so we just need to see if it holds above. We can start to see some more call interest building at 5050 and 5100 now as we approach monthly OPex. We can see that here And with a different visualisation here We have shown before that the money flows into SPX reached new highs. Here is a different visualisation of this from Nomura which shows that asset managers are basically really really long on this market. Look at the Skew on the Mag 7. Very very strong not looking like any pullback right now on the big boys. Money flows in SPX remain strong we are seeing some signs of possible hedging by traders in QQQ. The gamma is very very high again today which tells us that again volatility should be slightly surprised although we will have the CPI revisions released which will be interesting if they show some hawkish surprises. Note the last revisions data did indeed lead to dollar strengthening and Yields rising. If we do get that kind of move higher we will likely see some pullback as traders hedge going into CPI print next week. See the institutional research section to read about Morgan Stnaley s prediction for the CPI next week. IWM lastly Trading above a key gamma level skew points higher on 1 month expiration and 1 year expiration. Traders expect bond yields to fall and IWM to break higher. Yes market positioning does still look bullish on this market but I do want to share with you an alternative analysis from Goldman Sachs here. Goldman note that we are now seeing extremely bullish options activity in the collective Mag 6 names. This is something that we have seen 5 other times in the post covid era . WE note that if you look at forward returns after this occurrence the 2 4 week forward return is negative . We can see that in this graph below. GAMMA LEVELS TO WATCH plot these on your charting platform so you can track the price action against them. SPX trading at 5013 These are the key gamma levels Gamma level at 5025 My quant says max of the day expected to be 5031 5000 remains tech all resistance Gamma level at 4975 below that My quant says expected min of the day if we go that low is 4965. That marks the lower bound of the expected trading range today and we can expect a bounce from here. QQQ Call resistance remains at 440 Myq quant says upper trading bounce of today will be 436.95 Gamma level at 436 too. 435 is where the 0dte Call resistance is Below spot key gamma level is at 430. Below this my quant says min of the day expected to be 429. That d mark the bottom of the trading range if we were to fall that far. DATA LEDE US CPI Revisions markets will be looking to inform their thesis for the timing of the first rate cut. This comes ahead of CPI next week. Last time the 2022 revisions showed that inflation progress wasn t so great which made yields jump and the dollar jump. Fed s Logan speaks later though INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH With CPI next week let s take a look at Morgan Stanley s CPI prediction They expect CPI decelerated to 0.26 MOM in January below consensus of 0.3 Said they think core services was sideways and good decelerated.

2024-02-25,Surge Battery Metals Inc. Unveils High Grade Lithium Resource in Nevada Marking a Milestone for the EV Industry USA $NILIF CAN $NILI Latest News Surge Battery Metals Inc. has unveiled its maiden Mineral Resource Estimate for the Nevada North Lithium Project highlighting a substantial lithium resource marking it as the highest grade lithium clay resource in the USA. The MRE reveals 4.67 million tonnes of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent at a grade of 2 839 parts per million Li based on a cutoff of 1 250 ppm Li and over 4 Mt of LCE at a grade of 3 167 ppm Li at a higher 2 000 ppm Li cutoff. This significant discovery emphasizes the project s potential for expansion and further development. The CEO Greg Reimer expressed enthusiasm about these results and plans for continued exploration and development to expand the resource and enhance the project s certainty through drilling and technical studies. The lithium resources are primarily contained in shallow extensive clay beds with seven lithium rich beds identified so far. The MRE is based on twenty drill holes with the lithium mineral resources hosted by multiple clay beds. The report outlines the resources pit constrained estimates and notes the potential for future changes in metrics such as recovery bulk density and operating cost based on further studies. The company has outlined next steps including metallurgical test work surface exploration programs expansion drilling and a Preliminary Economic Assessment expected by the end of 2024. These activities aim to further validate and expand the project s lithium resources. Now let s create a graph based on the drill results provided. We ll visualize the lithium concentration by drill results across different cutoff grades mentioned in the press release. The graph above illustrates the Lithium Carbonate Equivalent at different cutoff grades for the Nevada North Lithium Project as announced by Surge Battery Metals Inc. It clearly shows how the LCE metric tons vary across different lithium ppm cutoff levels providing a visual representation of the project s lithium concentration as per the recent drilling results. Surge Battery Metals Inc. is leading lithium exploration in Nevada focusing on sustainable practices and strategic exploration amidst a fluctuating market. Nevada North Lithium Project has shown high grade lithium potential with groundbreaking discoveries and significant mineralization increases highlighted by 2022 and 2023 drilling programs. Strategic Location NNLP benefits from its location in Nevada the center of America s lithium battery industry near major projects like the Thacker Pass lithium mine and Tesla s gigafactory. 2024 Outlook Surge Battery Metals is set for transformative growth with plans for extensive exploration and the support of a nearly CDN $7 million treasury. A partnership with NASDAQ listed American Lithium underscores industry confidence. Sustainable Exploration Commitment to environmentally friendly and community engaged exploration practices aiming to lead responsibly in the lithium sector. Expansion Initiatives Submission of an Exploration Plan of Operations to the BLM for project scope expansion aiming to further define the mineral resource area and explore new lithium deposit extensions. Market Resilience Despite recent dips in lithium prices Surge Battery Metals remains optimistic preparing to leverage the anticipated market rebound as the demand for clean energy resources grows. $NILIF $NILI,reddit,0.9955,0.126,0.005,0.869,0.2160237729549408,0.009185263887047768,0.7747909426689148,positive,neutral

I use Fidelity and look at the guidance that they have for the research. For the most part I am seeing that I should probably just sell 3M and Tesla but might want to hold on to Boeing as they have some potential large orders in negotiations. Tesla looks like it is going to stick until late 2025. When it comes to the guidance from the investment companies do you go off what they say with their research tools If not how do you determine when to give up on your stinkers Better to take a loss and hope to make it up with a stronger stock Do you utilize the investment companies to provide individualized guidance Is that worth it,reddit,0.9413,0.133,0.039,0.828,0.06576656550168991,0.02452010288834572,0.9097133874893188,positive,neutral
2024-02-28,Holographic VR AR Industry Development Dynamic Weekly Report for Week 7 of 2024 Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on Platform X that Tesla s video generation technology is the best in the world even surpassing OpenAI s Sora. A day earlier Musk hinted that Tesla had mastered OpenAI like video generation technology a year ago. One X user posted What is OpenAI s Sora having to do with Tesla s FSD v12 Musk responded Tesla has been able to generate real world videos with accurate physics for about a year. It s not particularly interesting because all the training data comes from cars so it looks like a Tesla video albeit a dynamically generated world. Musk later shared several self driving videos that Tesla created a year ago saying in response to a user s comment Where Tesla video generation surpasses OpenAI is that it predicts extremely accurate physical scenarios. This is crucial for autonomous driving. In the early hours of February 16 OpenAI released the latest Wensheng Video model Sora along with a number of videos generated by Sora. Compared to the current mainstream second version of the Wensheng Video industry the Sora can generate a one minute video at once. Sora s release has once again attracted the attention of the entire market. Some people believe that Sora s innovative model architecture has opened a new path for the development of large models others believe that the launch of Sora has greatly advanced the arrival of general AI and some market participants say that Sora s popularity is closely linked to OpenAI s superb marketing. Predictably the emergence of Sora will undoubtedly promote artificial intelligence to lead a new round of industry change. Apple Vision Pro More than 1 000 apps Apple says the Apple Vision Pro has more than 1 000 apps and more than 1.5 million iPad apps that are compatible with the Vision Pro and able to run on the device. When the Vision Pro was released Apple said the headset had more than 600 apps so the number of apps has increased by more than 400 in the weeks since the Vision Pro launch. Currently Vision Pro and visionOS are in their early stages and since the product is only available in the US many popular apps may not be updated for visionOS until they are available in the global market. Nvidia will use AI to design AI chips According to Business Insider companies are competing for Nvidia s limited GPU supply of GPU used to train and build AI products and the AI industry is booming. Now the chip giant is using its own AI systems to speed up chip production apparently to keep up with demand. Nvidia has developed an AI system called ChipNeMo designed to speed up production of its GPU. Design a GPU usually requires significant manpower. Nvidia says it typically takes nearly 1 000 people to build a chip and each person needs to understand how the different parts of the design process work together. Mark Gurman The Apple Vision Pro may need four generations to reach the ideal form Mark Gurman In the article he noted that some people on Apple s headphone development team believe that four consecutive generations of devices may be needed to achieve the ideal form of Apple s Vision Pro headset. Many Vision Pro users consider the headphones themselves too bulky for long term use making the miniaturization of the one generation product an important touchstone for improvement. If the Apple team can solve these problems in four generations Gurman believes the Vision Pro will eventually replace the iPad. Meta CTO The Meta Quest will restore the eye movement tracking function Recently Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth talked about eye tracking technology when streaming live on its social platform. The 2022 Quest Pro features eye tracking which the new headset Quest 3 eliminates.. Bosworth Mentioned that eye tracking is one of the things it continues to push forward and come back to. Similarly Zuckerberg recently said Meta will restore eye tracking but has not determine which future headset will use the technology.

2024-03-01,Once a Hot Stock Market Trend Has a Name Its Best Days Are Likely too late Once a Hot Stock Market Trend Has a Name Its Best Days Are Likely Past Journal Report March 1 2024 By Derek Horstmeyer Once a stock market trend has been identified and named think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains. To study the performance of named stock market trends my research assistants and I did a deep dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations. The final list of named trends we researched was Watch for retailers Walmart Amazon.com Target Costco Wholesale and Home Depot. FANG for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms Amazon Netflix and Google parent Alphabet. FAANG for Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix and Google. Granola for big European companies GSK Roche Nestl L Or al LVMH Mo t Hennessy Louis Vuitton Novartis Novo Nordisk ASML Holding AstraZeneca SAP and Sanofi. The Magnificent Seven for tech giants Nvidia Tesla Meta Apple Alphabet Amazon and Microsoft. MT SAAS for cloud computing players Microsoft Twilio Salesforce Adobe Amazon and Shopify. BAT for Chinese tech firms Baidu Alibaba Group and Tencent. Cloud for emerging cloud computing stocks notably PayPal Zoom Video Communications Vimeo Dropbox Alphabet Adobe and Salesforce Smaller named trends like Mamaa and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends and their inclusion wouldn t have changed results. From first mention Next we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero date and 24 months after the zero date. For each named trend we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So for instance for FAANG we applied a 20 weight to Meta s return a 20 weight to Apple s a 20 weight to Amazon s 20 to Netflix and 20 to Alphabet. Finally we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S P 500. The first interesting finding When we look at the average of all these eight named trends we see considerable price run up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero date we see the average named trend deliver 36 in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened you could earn 36 percentage points above the S P 500 for the two years before it was named. Worth the ride until... But even if you don t have this magical foresight it still doesn t hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns. Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12 month mark to the 24 month mark after a trend has been named the average named trend lags behind the S P 500 by about 2 percentage points. When we look at the individual named trends it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero date to the 24 month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends both earning more than 60 in excess return over the two year period once they were coined by the press. On the other end the MT SAAS trade did the worst dropping more than 95 in excess returns over the two year period after being named. All in all this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it provided you haven t been too late to the party and ride the initial momentum if it happens. But if you get in past the 12 month mark the returns might not be so magnificent.

2024-03-03,BYD Company BYD Company Stock My Thesis BYD is unknown undervalued and currently growing at a very aggressive rate and has a lot of future potential to do well. In 2023 Q4 BYD overtook Tesla in the number of EV sales meaning it became the number one EV player in the market. At the rate BYD is growing at they will be a dominant force in the market in the years to come when cars transition to electric. However there are many risks associated with a new upcoming car brand in the industry of automotives particularly as it is a Chinese company. Pros of BYD BYD as a whole is growing at a very aggressive rate from almost doubling its revenue from 2021 to 2022. As it looks to expand into new horizons there is more potential for growth as it taps into Europe Southeast Asia Mexico and Brazil where they have only begun rolling out their EVs in 2022 2023. Strong balance sheet Cash 51 471 Billion CNY Debt 21 829 Billion CNY Cash is double debt From 2020 2022 BYD has been free cash flow positive. BYD is undervalued compared to Tesla at time of writing BYD Ratios PS 0.92 PB 4.09 P E 18.64 EV EBITDA 12.55 Tesla Ratios PS 6.56 PB 10.14 P E 46.9 EV EBITDA 41.24 Vertical Integration allows BYD to keep EVs at an affordable price to help maximize its sales. Instead of purchasing parts components from external companies BYD makes most of its components by itself e.g. batteries IGBT transistors and electronic components. The only parts BYD reported that they don t make are the windows and tires. BYD is heavily supported by the Chinese government through subsidies to help lower costs for them which allows BYD cars to be sold at a very affordable cost for consumers particularly in the Asian markets. Challenges Risks BYD is relatively unknown in the automobile industry and tapping into developed markets like Germany Japan and America will be very difficult. There will be challenges in convincing consumers to transition from well known brands with much longer history such as Toyota and Volkswagen etc... This is particularly true with the skepticism surrounding EVs and Chinese companies in general. BYD experienced this issue when they tried to sell their electric bus fleets in North America back in 2015. However through successful marketing and branding strategies BYD managed to win consumers and now 50 of electric buses are from BYD. There is a big question whether BYD is able to market strategically and convince the public of its electric cars. Heavy tariffs placed on BYD in Europe America will severely cut BYD s margins where we are seeing 25 tariffs in the likes of America combined with the difficulty of marketing their EVs to the public. This is due to the unfair playing advantages BYD has had from Chinese government subsidies. There is also a question of what will happen in the future if the Chinese government reduces the subsidies it is giving to BYD. Currently most of BYD s revenue is from China so there are risks associated with how the Chinese economy does. But BYD is looking to diversify by expanding globally as mentioned previously. One of the biggest risks is the China Risk . We have seen crackdowns in large Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent due to their market dominance unfair competition and fraudulent practices. As a result we have seen Chinese stocks plummeting down and losing a lot of value in recent years. Whether BYD will be a target of this when they grow further in the future is a red flag for many investors. There has been a recent announcement by Biden that Chinese EVs will be banned in America due to safety issues and it is possible that European countries may follow in the footsteps of America and the bans could spread to the developed Western countries etc. This is certainly a big risk to BYD s opportunity to expand into the Western markets as they have just recently set up new bases in the likes of Germany and Australia. Future revenues will take a big hit and earnings potentials will be seriously limited if this is the case. The geopolitical tensions between the West and China is a major risk factor we have to account for. Summary In conclusion BYD presents an interesting investment opportunity. The company has demonstrated impressive growth overtaking Tesla in EV sales and expanding into new markets. Its strong balance sheet positive free cash flow and undervaluation compared to Tesla suggest potential for significant upside. Vertical integration and government subsidies have allowed BYD to keep prices competitive and penetrate markets effectively. While there are challenges such as tapping into developed markets and navigating tariffs BYD has shown resilience and adaptability in the past. The company s efforts to diversify its revenue streams and expand globally mitigate risks associated with its reliance on the Chinese market. Recent announcements of potential bans in Western countries could pose a significant threat to BYD s expansion plans. While the China Risk is a concern BYD s track record and strategic positioning make it a promising stock for investors looking to capitalize on the growing EV market and the transition to electric vehicles particularly in the developing countries. My Take Yes we have seen the large crackdown on big tech stocks in China. However BYD works closely with the government and is supported through subsidies incentives and government support so it is in BYD s interest to follow CCP s policies and regulations. China recognizes that they are facing a global warming crisis and are transitioning to clean up their country through switching to EVs so it is in the CCP s interest to work with BYD. The world is larger than America Europe and there is a huge market in the developing nations. I recognize that there are many risks in investing in BYD but for the valuation it is currently at I believe it is undervalued and there is significant potential in the years to come.,reddit,0.9956,0.128,0.066,0.806,0.3193126618862152,0.013432829640805721,0.6672545075416565,positive,neutral

2024-03-05,These are the stocks on my watchlist No positions in any stocks long term but Amazon Mag7 general broad market indices. To clarify since I ve been asked I usually make these watchlists premarket but can be delayed if I m trading the open. These aren t mean to be taken as gospel they re just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and are NOT predictions of stock price EOD. Some of the stocks I post are $500M market cap and are NOT good long term investments but are good candidates to day trade. News APGE Worth watching today. Reported phase 1 data for treatment of Lymphoma was positive. Up 50 at the open. NYCB Reported material weaknesses in how it tracks loan risks on 2 28. No new news but still keeping this on my radar.

2024-03-12,EXCLUSIVE Alaska Energy Metals CEO Says Nickel Price Slump Could Hurt Environment EV Makers Can t Really Look Themselves In The Face ZINGER KEY POINTS Prices for nickel are down around 30 because of oversupply from Indonesia. The automobile industry could play a key role in helping develop nickel deposits in North America. Editor s note This story has been updated to clarify the Alaska Energy Metals CEO s comments on automotive companies. Nickel prices are tanking and that s hurting companies exploration efforts according to Alaska Energy Metals AKEMF CEO Greg Beischer . It makes it harder to raise capital because the commodity is out of favor in investors eyes Beischer told Benzinga. With a low stock price he added if we sell shares that s expensive capital. It dilutes our shareholders. The world s nickel mines are divided into two types of deposits sulfide and laterite. Sulfide deposits offer easier extraction while laterite deposits require more energy and chemicals. Because of a lack of exploration in recent years high grade sulfide deposits are becoming depleted. Low grade sulfide deposits offer an alternative to the more polluting laterite deposits in Indonesia. Low Nickel Prices Drive Mines Out Of Business Prices for nickel a key material in stainless steel production and electric vehicle batteries are down around 30 over the past year because of oversupply from Indonesian nickel mines. Tempered growth forecasts for electric vehicles have also helped pressure prices. But with the tanking nickel price these low grade sulfide deposits are becoming uneconomical making it harder for developers to bring them into production Beischer said. There s going to be projects like ours that are discovered and advanced that are going to have difficulty getting financed while the nickel price is low he said. At a low nickel price it starts to drive some existing mines out of business. Alaska Energy Metals is developing its Nikolai nickel sulfide project on the southern flank of the Alaska Range about 124 miles southeast of Fairbanks. North American and European nickel users should reject nickel produced in a way that creates a net detriment to the environment even when end uses such as EVs are considered in the equation he said. They can t really look themselves in the face by purchasing metals that are being produced in a manner that s anything but environmentally friendly he said. The automobile industry could play a key role in helping develop nickel deposits in North America which has strong environmental and regulatory frameworks he said. They are going to have a much stronger lobby than the mining industry could ever have he said. That will be needed to help burnish the mining industry s image as the industry is still viewed by the messes it made in the old days instead of the modern methods employed among North American miners nowadays he said. Automakers such as General Motors Co. and Tesla Inc have been investing in mining companies or contracting with them to secure supplies of electric vehicle metals including nickel. Ford Motor Co. Last year said it would take a stake in a plant under construction in Indonesia that will supply nickel chemicals for electric vehicle batteries. Car companies and mining companies should collaborate and the government should save its money but the government should also have pro mining development policies to go with their electrification agenda Beischer said. The U.S. has ceded metal supply chains to other nations but at the same time isn t particularly friendly to mining companies even though a lot of minerals will need to be produced to support the nation s electrification ambitions he said. There seems to be a disconnect he said. The permitting agencies still move very slowly. The mining industry doesn t want to see environmental regulations rolled back in the U.S. he said. Rather it would like to see the timeline for environmental reviews sped up he added. Just make the industry feel welcome encourage mine development Beischer said. Have the permitting agencies move at a faster rate. We ve got to get this done. Alaska Energy Metals shares are currently up about 1.36 trading at 29 cents on last check.

2024-03-22,$ALLG Allego SuperCharging Europe Hollandse Glorie Company overview Allego NV provides and operates EV charging locations throughout Europe. They have all kinds of chargers ranging from slow charging to ultrafast but their focus is fast charging on parking lots. They operate 34.000 charging points throughout Europe. The stock is undervalued. In the US sentiment for EV related stocks is very bad. Most EV stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. This resulted in a big sell off of anything related EV. But this company is not on the US market. It s a European company and the European market is totally different. Sales In Europe EV sales are still growing helped by legislation. Although consumers are still reluctant to buy one big organisations are all switching to EVs. Most big companies or government organisations have strict CO2 reduction goals and switching to EVs is a quick win. The company started in The Netherlands which has been one of the front runners in EV adoption. Bigger countries such as France and Germany were slower to adopt EVs but are catching up rapidly . In these countries there s a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. Only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time so Allego is very quickly winning contracts all over Europe. Their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed Allego to grow FAST at the moment. There s not a lot of competition in Europe some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand alone locations next to the major roads . Financially Third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2 to 28.6 million compared to 22.3 million in the prior year period. Third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0 to 22.0 million compared to 14.4 million for the three months ended September 30 2022. Gross profit increased to 5.4 million compared to million in the prior year period gross margin during the quarter was 18.9 . Third quarter 2023 net loss was million compared to million in the prior year period Operational EBITDA was 2.6 million reflecting higher charging revenue and improved charging gross margin compared to the prior year period loss of million. Allego recently signed two power purchase agreements totaling 100 gigawatt hours of energy per year with Energy Solutions Group the largest independent green energy producer in the Benelux region with renewable energy sourced from a solar park that is expected to be operational in January 2024 and a wind farm that is expected to be completed in January 2025. In October Allego recorded over 1 million sessions per month across its network. All in all Allego is in pole position to becoming the biggest EV charging provider in Europe. They have a smart strategy in place and lack competition. They are on their way to stopping the cash burn in 2024 and turning profitable in 2025. Some macro economic developments are helping them grow such as strict European legislation. Other macro economic developments may be unpredictable such as energy prices or energy net congestion. The stock price has fallen because of negative sentiment surrounding electric vehicles and this provides an excellent buying opportunity Get yourself some of these shares in the $0.80 $0.85 price range On their 2023 full year results I think they will climb to $1 . $ALLG,reddit,0.9921,0.137,0.067,0.795,0.844702959060669,0.07399576902389526,0.08130128681659698,positive,positive

This resulted in a big sell off of anything related EV. But this company is not on the US market. It s a European company and the European market is totally different. In Europe EV sales are still growing helped by legislation. Although consumers are still reluctant to buy one big organisations are all switching to EVs. Most big companies or government organisations have strict CO2 reduction goals and switching to EVs is a quick win. These organisations have to install chargers on their parking lots and Allego has been providing these since 2013. These big organisations will negotiate pricing agreements on the energy prices so the margins will be thin. But the big advantage is the charging needs on these parking lots are predictable and continuous. This was their main focus during the starting years of the company and a smart strategy they were able to build revenue and gain expertise with predictable income in a time when private EV ownership was still low. In short Allego has a baseline steady stream of predictable revenue from partnerships with big organisations by providing charging solutions for their own fleet of cars. Their focus in the last 3 years has been to partner with big companies to build charging stations on their parking lots to offer charging solutions to the public. They landed some BIG contracts Burger Kings Europe . They are slowly shifting their strategy to offering public charging stations which make sense in 2024 when EV ownership is getting higher and still increasing in Europe. On these public charging stations the charging hours and predictability will be lower but margins will be higher. In short Allego has shifted very successfully to offering public charging locations on parking lots of businesses such as supermarkets restaurants and hotels. The company started in The Netherlands which has been one of the front runners in EV adoption. Bigger countries such as France and Germany were slower to adopt EVs but are catching up rapidly . In these countries there s a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. Only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time so Allego is very quickly winning contracts all over Europe. Their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed Allego to grow FAST at the moment. There s not a lot of competition in Europe some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand alone locations next to the major roads . In short Allego is extremely well positioned to deploy new charging locations throughout Europe at a rapid pace since there is hardly any real competitor in Europe that does what they do. Financially Allego is in a reasonabe position. Their 2023 revenue is up 28 from 2022 and is expected to grow another 30 in 2024. They are about to publish their full year results but I expect the total revenue to be around 185m in 2023 . Their gross margins are pretty good and their operational EBITDA will be around 35m . Their total debt is 320m which is obviously quite high and their interest payments are too high compared to their revenue. But in 2023 they made several big investments and they landed some big contracts in exchange for equity. Also their cash flow is improving so I expect them to continue into 2024 without increasing their debt. This will be a crucial turning point in their way towards profitability. In short Allego has strong revenues and margins with good growth numbers. Their debt is high and they should be careful not to increase it but they already made big investments in 2023 that should pay off in 2024. All in all Allego is in pole position to becoming the biggest EV charging provider in Europe. They have a smart strategy in place and lack competition. They are on their way to stopping the cash burn in 2024 and turning profitable in 2025. Some macro economic developments are helping them grow such as strict European legislation. Other macro economic developments may be unpredictable such as energy prices or energy net congestion. The stock price has fallen because of negative sentiment surrounding electric vehicles and this provides an excellent buying opportunity Get yourself some of these shares in the $0.80 $0.85 price range On their 2023 full year results I think they will climb to $1 .

2024-03-25,$ALLG EV charging station Shell BIG move The market Shell an energy force to be reckoned with in the United States has one of the largest station footprints in the nation.To meet the growing need for public EV charging stations however Yahoo Finance reported the company s announcement to shut down 1 000 gas pumps and replace them with public EV charging hubs. We are upgrading our retail network with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers in response to changing customer needs read the company s 2024 Energy Transition Strategy. This news tells us what Shell are thinking and of course that demand globally will be rising. Company overview Allego NV provides and operates EV charging locations throughout Europe. They have all kinds of chargers ranging from slow charging to ultrafast but their focus is fast charging on parking lots. They operate 34.000 charging points throughout Europe. The stock is undervalued. In the US sentiment for EV related stocks is very bad. Most EV stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. This resulted in a big sell off of anything related EV. But this company is not on the US market. It s a European company and the European market is totally different. Sales In Europe EV sales are still growing helped by legislation. Although consumers are still reluctant to buy one big organisations are all switching to EVs. Most big companies or government organisations have strict CO2 reduction goals and switching to EVs is a quick win. The company started in The Netherlands which has been one of the front runners in EV adoption. Bigger countries such as France and Germany were slower to adopt EVs but are catching up rapidly . In these countries there s a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. Only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time so Allego is very quickly winning contracts all over Europe. Their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed Allego to grow FAST at the moment. There s not a lot of competition in Europe some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand alone locations next to the major roads . Financially Third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2 to 28.6 million compared to 22.3 million in the prior year period. Third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0 to 22.0 million compared to 14.4 million for the three months ended September 30 2022. Gross profit increased to 5.4 million compared to million in the prior year period gross margin during the quarter was 18.9 . Third quarter 2023 net loss was million compared to million in the prior year period Operational EBITDA was 2.6 million reflecting higher charging revenue and improved charging gross margin compared to the prior year period loss of million. Allego recently signed two power purchase agreements totaling 100 gigawatt hours of energy per year with Energy Solutions Group the largest independent green energy producer in the Benelux region with renewable energy sourced from a solar park that is expected to be operational in January 2024 and a wind farm that is expected to be completed in January 2025. In October Allego recorded over 1 million sessions per month across its network. All in all Allego is in pole position to becoming the biggest EV charging provider in Europe. They have a smart strategy in place and lack competition. They are on their way to stopping the cash burn in 2024 and turning profitable in 2025. Some macro economic developments are helping them grow such as strict European legislation. Other macro economic developments may be unpredictable such as energy prices or energy net congestion. The stock price has fallen because of negative sentiment surrounding electric vehicles and this provides an excellent buying opportunity Get yourself some of these shares in the $0.80 $0.85 price range On their 2023 full year results I think they will climb to $1 .

2024-03-27,$ALLG Allego Makings of a multi day runner earnings April 2 Earnings Last Q Allego Reports Third Quarter 2023 Results Steady Growth in Line With Projections for Year Ford Allego team up for fast EV charging at dealers across Europe Allego Enters Into Partnership with Burger King France to Enable Its Restaurants to Provide Ultra Fast Charging Reinforcing Allego s Leading Position in France Company overview Allego NV provides and operates EV charging locations throughout Europe. They have all kinds of chargers ranging from slow charging to ultrafast but their focus is fast charging on parking lots. They operate 34.000 charging points throughout Europe. The stock is undervalued. In the US sentiment for EV related stocks is very bad. Most EV stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. This resulted in a big sell off of anything related EV. But this company is not on the US market. It s a European company and the European market is totally different. Sales In Europe EV sales are still growing helped by legislation. Although consumers are still reluctant to buy one big organisations are all switching to EVs. Most big companies or government organisations have strict CO2 reduction goals and switching to EVs is a quick win. The company started in The Netherlands which has been one of the front runners in EV adoption. Bigger countries such as France and Germany were slower to adopt EVs but are catching up rapidly . In these countries there s a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. Only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time so Allego is very quickly winning contracts all over Europe. Their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed Allego to grow FAST at the moment. There s not a lot of competition in Europe some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand alone locations next to the major roads . Financially Third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2 to 28.6 million compared to 22.3 million in the prior year period. Third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0 to 22.0 million compared to 14.4 million for the three months ended September 30 2022. Gross profit increased to 5.4 million compared to million in the prior year period gross margin during the quarter was 18.9 . Third quarter 2023 net loss was million compared to million in the prior year period Operational EBITDA was 2.6 million reflecting higher charging revenue and improved charging gross margin compared to the prior year period loss of million. Allego recently signed two power purchase agreements totaling 100 gigawatt hours of energy per year with Energy Solutions Group the largest independent green energy producer in the Benelux region with renewable energy sourced from a solar park that is expected to be operational in January 2024 and a wind farm that is expected to be completed in January 2025. In October Allego recorded over 1 million sessions per month across its network. All in all Allego is in pole position to becoming the biggest EV charging provider in Europe. They have a smart strategy in place and lack competition. They are on their way to stopping the cash burn in 2024 and turning profitable in 2025. Some macro economic developments are helping them grow such as strict European legislation. Other macro economic developments may be unpredictable such as energy prices or energy net congestion.

2024-03-29,Xiaomi started selling electric cars They sold 88898 electric vehicles in the first 24 hours. The OTC stock ticker is XIACY. Make sure it is ADR stock not Class B stock. Basically i am told this Chinese EV is better than Tesla in terms of both travel distance and price. It already went up 10 after the news. The OTC stock costs $10 per share. I did not buy it yet. Might buy when there is a dip cause eventually they are going to sell in Europe and they are gonna dominate. For those of you who are not familiar with Xiaomi its robot vacuum cleaner and cell phone are very popular and known for top qualities. Yes EV is a different product. The standard version of Xiaomi s SU7 has a starting range of 700 kilometers which is better than the long range version of Tesla s Model 3 Lei said. The starting price is about $4 000 cheaper than Tesla s Model 3 sedan which starts at 245 900 yuan in China.,reddit,0.9441,0.105,0.008,0.887,0.1779383420944214,0.019202381372451782,0.8028593063354492,positive,neutral

2024-03-31,Frustrated with the amount of scammers in the financial space Hello It feels like almost everyone in the financial sector is a scammer sometimes. I know this isn t strictly true but man the scammers are everywhere. I was doing research on Sam Bankman Fried in the past week and even when I searched for terms like financial scam or financial fraud or whatever the exact terms I used I got results back from known scammers like Warrior Trading who was going to warm me of frauds I clicked on a Youtube video from 60 minutes on Sam Bankman Fried and I said to myself 60 minutes won t scam me. And then Michael Lewis comes on and starts shilling for SBF. What the heck Didn t Michael Lewis write a book about toxic assets which were then sold to investors as safe and AAA and then leveraged to the hilt from various Wall St. banks and credit ratings agencies in a combination of folly stupidity and greed fraud The main question often was what percentage was stupidity and what percentage was scamming the public. That was The Big Short. Here Lewis takes the side of someone who embezzled billions freerolled the bezzle with an insane risky bet recommended lots of shitcoins to unsuspecting investors encouraged them to use even more risks with derivative bets on these shitcoins and then outright stole what remained from investors to prop up his failing crypto hedge fund Alameda Research which has lost billions in bad trades. CNBC and Bloomberg are always hyping various scams. Elon Musk posts he will make a flying car at Tesla a few years ago the stock jumps double digits on the news and CNBC hypes it up. Then invite Michael Saylor to pump his crypto scheme even though he was a scammer way back from the dot com bubble. His firm had major accounting issues and somehow he is still not only CEO of his stupid company but invited to pump it while he is dumping shares and has been selling consistently for the past six months or so. I remember when CNBC was endlessly hyping Nikola and their electric truck and then a few weeks later that was revealed to be a scam and the truck towed up a hill and then a fancy promo is shot making it look like it s running on EV power and CNBC never apologized at all Don t get me started on WallStBets and RDDT or DJT. It s scams all the way down,reddit,-0.995,0.077,0.165,0.758,0.03014892153441906,0.22385141253471375,0.7459996342658997,negative,neutral

2024-04-03,Is it easy to beat the market now Short question if you invest in the top tech companies is it easy to beat the marketing meaning the S P We ve all heard the mantra you ll never beat the market but is that really true any more or does the phrase need some sort of updating I ve been investing for 15 years now and I think I be beat the market or at least the overall S P500 every single year. There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains it s significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S P ETF. My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I ve always been higher for over a decade now. So hear me out I ve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple always invest in large cap stocks. With a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft Nvidia Facebook Amazon Tesla Apple Nvidia Amd and a few others I ve found this sector completely destroys the overall market. Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart it s very aggressive and very heavily in tech. The difference in the S P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I ve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways but I m still beating the NASDAQ too. The contrarian s argument is that given enough time my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I m up right now for over a decade that correction would have to be astronomical and I don t see how the whole world economy wouldn t fall if these tech picks crash down 50 at once. I m not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that. I m just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market and if so what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I m doing Is there a point where the market is all tech now It sure feels like the S P is so heavily weighted by tech now that maybe that s the real underlying answer to my question.,reddit,0.404,0.093,0.084,0.823,0.08972525596618652,0.21263287961483002,0.697641909122467,positive,neutral
2024-04-03,Fancy Names Intel vs Carlisle I ve always been proud of owning Intel in a DRIP since 1996. It s a name everyone knows so it s assumed that it s a great investment.

Hard to believe. It hits home today because Intel has once again disappointed the market and is down 15 at the open. Carlisle is up $12 share for some reason. I point this out because all too often we concentrate on NVDA TSLA and DIS but the real wealth creation is in companies that we hardly know. I had screen shots of the charts back to 1996 but they can t be attached. Take a look for yourself. Maybe worth looking at boring companies that quietly grow over decades.,reddit,0.8519,0.09,0.036,0.874,0.054620008915662766,0.5871098637580872,0.35827013850212097,positive,negative

2024-04-05,$NKLA Nikola Run Up to EC Trending Ticker During Q4 raised $230.3M ending the year with $464.7M of unrestricted cash highest unrestricted cash balance since Q4 2021 Nikola today announced it will report its first quarter ended March 31 2024 financial results and business updates on Tuesday May 7 2024. On that day Nikola s management will hold a conference call and webcast at 10 30 a.m. ET to review and discuss the company s business and outlook. Today Nikola stock jumped by as much as nearly 16 on news that it produced 43 of the Class 8 FCEVs and sold 40 of them to wholesalers destined for end customers in the first quarter. Those deliveries were on top of the 35 trucks shipped in the fourth quarter of 2023 in its first quarterly production period. Nikola surpassed estimates for deliveries of its hydrogen big rigs in the first quarter a sign it was making progress in its pivot to the technology from battery electric trucks after some missteps that battered its share price. Nikola in February set a target to deliver as many as 350 hydrogen powered fuel cell electric trucks in 2024 and said it had delivered 35 units in the fourth quarter. We are on track for a successful 2024 by continuing the momentum set in 2023 said Nikola CEO Steve Girsky. It s about more than just setting goals. It s about following through on our commitments. This includes not only the production and sale of our hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks but also the start of returns for our battery electric trucks to customers. Forbes article While its current sales volume is modest delivering just 154 hydrogen and battery trucks since last year Nikola appears to be far outselling Tesla in the electric truck market.Elon Musk said in late 2022 when the Tesla Semi presumably went into production that deliveries would ramp up throughout 2023 with a target of delivering 50 000 this year. However the company hasn t shared any delivery figures for it since then. The truck wasn t referenced in first quarter delivery figures released this week and Tesla also didn t include Semi figures in its quarterly financial filings last year. The model was listed as still being in pilot production in Tesla s annual report filed early this year with no details.Notably the Tesla Semi also isn t registered among the trucks qualifying for California s clean truck rebates the nation s most generous suggesting it s not being sold in the market where demand for electric commercial vehicles is highest. So far the only known users of the Tesla Semi are Frito Lay and Pepsi which have about 100 trucks hauling chips and soda in California.Tesla didn t respond to a request for details on how many Semis it s shipped so far and when it would register the truck for California incentives. My other favorite is Allego European EV postponed EC due to a filing but they just got Volvo as a customer $NKLA,reddit,0.9508,0.049,0.013,0.938,0.36982762813568115,0.02042512036859989,0.6097471714019775,positive,neutral

2024-04-06,Fisker Inc. My Bullish Thesis $FSRN Fisker has long been shunned in the EV industry known for the Fisker Karma which since has been become a meme at this point reminds me of how Lucid is trying to market its cars and is in the infancy stages of a car company. Fisker is poised to break the stagnant EV market they already have begun aggressive price cuts to the $500 million dollars of finished goods inventory that being 2023 Fisker Oceans. The company also has future plans coming through the pipeline to compete with the likes of Rivian being the Fisker Alaska competing with Tesla s roadster being the Fisker Ronin and a more affordable smaller sized EV for city living being the Fisker Pear. The company is being evaluated currently and being financially restructured by the likes of Deutsche Bank AG and PJT Partners which will help Fisker restructure its current debt which only sits at 1.5 Billion currently competitors like Rivian s debt is currently at 18.6 Billion Lucid s debt is 10.2 Billion Nio s debt is 10.1 Billion and even the likes of Xpeng being 4.7 billion Polestar 4.2 Billion and Mullen automotive for the meme their debt is 1.9 Billion and their cars look like Chevy express vans from 2005. Anyways the point here is that Fisker is very efficient at using capital given to them unlike their competitors . This is just one reason as to why I am so excited to hold this stock and will continue to in the near and long future. The Fisker Ocean priced at $47 000 even after delivery and taxes is much more affordable than a Tesla model Y currently Fisker is price cutting Fisker Oceans to as low as $24 999 and its just one reason as to why I will continue to hold the stock I own please check out my previous post in this sub and read the comments if you would like more DD like this currently I am waiting for my power to be turned on dealing with the fallout of Winter Storm Cora and it has been 5 days since my power went out. I will be more than happy to explain more of my bullish thesis on Fisker and why I am so adamant about this stock rising I believe a reverse split is in order regarding Fisker which will bring it back to the NYSE s minimum requirements as currently it is on the pink sheets OTC market. If you have the option or means to purchase this stock anytime soon I truly believe that this is the next Tesla . Please keep discussion in the comments nice and supporting my case I do not want unnecessary flame wars in the comments. Thank you for reading if you made it this far please drop some hearts in the comments any color $FSRN,reddit,0.9835,0.105,0.05,0.845,0.09903501719236374,0.02786348946392536,0.8731014728546143,positive,neutral

2024-04-06,Why I m Betting on KULR With my excitement on some of the KULR posts and the chat I keep getting private DMs about why I m into them. So here s my DD after reviewing the last few months of news. PROS 4 2 24 Secure $1M contract with H55 the technological spinoff of Solar Impulse . 3 27 24 Retired all outstanding Yorkville debt. 3 26 24 Secure a six figure deal with Lockheed Martin to develop PCM heat sinks for precision missile electronics. This comes on the heels of Lockheed s own $219m contact with the U.S. Army for missiles. 3 21 24 Received an additional purchase order from the U.S. Army increasing their total contract value to $1.81M. 3 19 24 Lands initial testing order with a leading U.S. automaker 3 14 24 Announces a strategic contract exceeding $865 000 with Nanorocks and aims to enhance Voyager s CubeSat applications. 3 12 24 Secured new special permits from US DoT 2 21 24 Announced groundbreaking developmental program that will play a pivotal role in battery tech to be deployed on space missions scheduled for 2024 and beyond. 1 17 24 Secures exclusive global rights to NASA s battery safety tech to service world s largest OEM users. When this was announced the article also highlighted these aspects of KULR s business servings A top global automaker for next generation EV battery safety and testing solutions One of the world s largest private space exploration companies for enhanced battery safety solutions A top 5 American electric truck manufacturer to design and develop safer next gen batteries A top 5 global manufacturer in the electric vertical take off and landing sector for safe battery testing solutions Testing lithium ion cells in battery packs designed for the Artemis Space Program And many other customers across all battery chemistries including silicon anode solid state nickel manganese cobalt and lithium iron phosphate . unconfirmed speculation a user on KULR rummaged through KULR s Twitter page and the only U.S. automaker they claimed to find was Tesla. If Tesla proves true then it would not be a stretch to believe Space X is included the private sector s mentioned above. my personal speculation with their participation in the Artemis program is that other Artemis awardees like Intuitive Machines Lunar Outpost Venturi Astrolab 3tc will have to use the NASA KULR tech when such tech would be required. CONS 4 1 24 KULR filed a notice of late filing for the yearly report but is expected to report within the grace period. Amended KULR will release their 4th quarter and year end earnings call on 4 12 24. 2 16 24 Receives Non Compliance Notice from NYSE American for a 30 day trading average .2 share. Amended 3 8 24 KULR receives acceptance of compliance plan by NYSE. 1 9 24 Reduces work force by 15 in effort to break even in 2nd quarter 2024. personally I don t like the layoff restructuring for the people perspective but from the corporate perspective i begrudgingly understand. Keep in mind all this news above is for the current quarter and for the most part will not reflect on the previous quarter year financials that are due out 4 12. All of these promising developments in the public and private sectors touching on DOD DOT aerospace EV etc with highly regarded companies is why I m betting on high futures here. So no more need to inbox me on why I think their future looks good on a long hold. This is my opinion alone and like any other stock do your own DD. Take the bets you can afford. To the other question I get it is not too late to buy in as I see this skyrocketing past $1 and more this year with their developing professional relationships.

2024-04-08,$FSRN Fisker Full Sending Tomorrow Fisker is making notable strides in the electric vehicle sector differentiating itself with unique strategies and competitive pricing reminiscent of its journey from the days of the Fisker Karma. The company is setting a robust trajectory similar to emerging players like Lucid and Rivian aiming to disrupt the market with aggressive price reductions especially on its 2023 Fisker Ocean models signaling an ambitious inventory strategy. Noteworthy is Fisker s financial restructuring under the advisory of Deutsche Bank AG and PJT Partners. This move is pivotal mirroring PJT Partners successful financial strategizing with Carvana which notably rebounded in stock value following their intervention. Moreover Fisker s financial health is comparatively robust with its debt significantly lower than competitors demonstrating efficient capital utilization. This is underscored by a recent investment surge from Vanguard Group Inc. which acquired a substantial share in Fisker signaling strong market confidence. The Fisker Ocean stands out for its affordability further accentuated by recent price cuts presenting a viable alternative to higher priced competitors like Tesla. Fisker s strategic initiatives including potential reverse splits to meet NYSE standards signal a determined path toward growth reminiscent of Carvana s resurgence post PJT Partners engagement. As an investor and observer Fisker s trajectory bolstered by strategic partnerships and financial prudence presents a compelling case for its future in the EV market. Let s continue this discussion constructively and share insights in the comments below. TLDR Fisker is advancing in the EV market with aggressive pricing and unique strategies such as price cuts to US CANADA EU Inventory hinting at a bright future akin to its peers like Lucid and Rivian. With strategic financial restructuring advised by Deutsche Bank AG and PJT Partners and a significant investment from Vanguard Group Inc. Fisker shows strong financial health and market confidence. The affordability and strategic pricing of the Fisker Ocean alongside initiatives like potential reverse splits underscore Fisker s growth potential drawing parallels to Carvana s recovery guided by PJT Partners.

I expect this to run again my target 2$ 3$ especially with Volvo as a partner and the many partners to come in the near term. The market Shell an energy force to be reckoned with in the United States has one of the largest station footprints in the nation.To meet the growing need for public EV charging stations however Yahoo Finance reported the company s announcement to shut down 1 000 gas pumps and replace them with public EV charging hubs. We are upgrading our retail network with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers in response to changing customer needs read the company s 2024 Energy Transition Strategy. This news tells us what Shell are thinking and of course that demand globally will be rising. Company overview Allego NV provides and operates EV charging locations throughout Europe. They have all kinds of chargers ranging from slow charging to ultrafast but their focus is fast charging on parking lots. They operate 34.000 charging points throughout Europe. The stock is undervalued. In the US sentiment for EV related stocks is very bad. Most EV stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. This resulted in a big sell off of anything related EV. But this company is not on the US market. It s a European company and the European market is totally different. Sales In Europe EV sales are still growing helped by legislation. Although consumers are still reluctant to buy one big organisations are all switching to EVs. Most big companies or government organisations have strict CO2 reduction goals and switching to EVs is a quick win. The company started in The Netherlands which has been one of the front runners in EV adoption. Bigger countries such as France and Germany were slower to adopt EVs but are catching up rapidly . In these countries there s a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. Only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time so Allego is very quickly winning contracts all over Europe. Their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed Allego to grow FAST at the moment. There s not a lot of competition in Europe some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand alone locations next to the major roads . Financially Third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2 to 28.6 million compared to 22.3 million in the prior year period. Third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0 to 22.0 million compared to 14.4 million for the three months ended September 30 2022. Gross profit increased to 5.4 million compared to million in the prior year period gross margin during the quarter was 18.9 . Third quarter 2023 net loss was million compared to million in the prior year period Operational EBITDA was 2.6 million reflecting higher charging revenue and improved charging gross margin compared to the prior year period loss of million. Allego recently signed two power purchase agreements totaling 100 gigawatt hours of energy per year with Energy Solutions Group the largest independent green energy producer in the Benelux region with renewable energy sourced from a solar park that is expected to be operational in January 2024 and a wind farm that is expected to be completed in January 2025. In October Allego recorded over 1 million sessions per month across its network. All in all Allego is in pole position to becoming the biggest EV charging provider in Europe. They have a smart strategy in place and lack competition. They are on their way to stopping the cash burn in 2024 and turning profitable in 2025. Some macro economic developments are helping them grow such as strict European legislation. $ALLG,reddit,0.99,0.111,0.062,0.827,0.18470461666584015,0.06754358857870102,0.7477518320083618,positive,neutral

If your HYSA and your retirement accounts are taken care of and doing well. What stocks would you buy with a brokerage account that has $2 500 in it I m considering Tesla Boeing and Tilray Edit The above stocks are examples of the types of stocks I m interested in.

2024-04-14,10 years ago we discussed how we select stocks. Here s the 2024 version. Hi r investing roughly 10 years ago there was a great discussion about I discussed my method Trending Value and that led to me sharing my results with many of you via a program I had written. Well that program broke and remained dormant for years... until now. So what is Trending Value It s a method published by James O Shaughnessey in his What Works on Wall Street book. During decades of backtesting it generated over 21 annual returns with equal standard deviation to the total market. It generated a lot of discussion and lead to In my mind this method resonates the truest... far truer than those who advocate watching the check out lines at your grocery store to see which products are being purchased. The method summarizing is the following When you run a screen for stocks with good P E or P B what do you look for You find a stock with a P E multiple of 12. Is this good Is this bad Neither and both without a frame of reference. O Shaughnessey s method rates 6 key financial metrics for every stock against the whole market to come up with a cumulative VALUE BASED score. Those metrics are P E P B P FCF P S EV EBITDA and Shareholder Yield which is dividend yield stock buyback yield . All 6 metrics are ranked 0 100 where 100 is the best ratio in the stock universe and 0 is the worst. The top 10 of stocks will typically have scores in the 420 range. They are undervalued relative to the rest of the market. However just because a stock is undervalued DOES NOT mean that it s a good buy. It could be facing legal action failing drug trials having a CEO that just went to jail or other event that can t be reflected in these numbers. That s where momentum comes into play. We take the top decile of stocks and reorder them by 6 month price momentum. Invest equally in the top 25 hold for a year liquidate repeat. The companies you buy are undervalued and the market is rallying behind them. Back testing while not a prediction of future results yielded a 21.2 average ROI with this method. Of course there s no screener that does this nor is there a way to even view Shareholder Yield in one location. When I started this 10 years back Yes MatLab. Wrong tool for the job. Thankfully ChatGPT has turned even amateur hobbyist coders into useful contributors and a python version has been born. I ll post the results of today s run below. Feel free to ask for a specific stock and I ll post the results of that ticker. Keep in mind it is filtered to Market Cap $200M and the name of the method is Trending VALUE your growth stocks are going to be viewed very poorly. Edit You ll occasionally see a value like 10000 for P E or another field. That means the value was either missing or negative. This is to artificially just kill that field for that ticker.,reddit,0.986,0.115,0.049,0.835,0.0631202831864357,0.04794849827885628,0.888931155204773,positive,neutral

Some of the best below. had a market cap of $498.8B. For FYE 2023 operating cashflows were $13 256m and capital expenditures were $8 899m. This leaves $4 357m of surplus cashflow. If all were paid as a dividend in 116 years your capital would be returned. Returning To Petrol Volkswagen EV Sales Plunge 25 In Europe People need to hear that there has never been a better time to short Tesla. Delivery disaster. Price cuts. FSD pricing slashed. Energy deployments halved. Inventory piling up Stock priced at 60X P E on declining earnings. Auto companies with stable earnings and paying a dividend trade at 5 10X P E. A reasonable 20 PE at $2.5 EPE gets us to $50. Tesla has some old inventory at their Orland Park IL service center some dating back to January. No wonder why Tesla is announcing layoffs. JPMORGAN .. the sweeping layoffs announced yesterday amounting to a reduction in crewed production capacity should now leave no doubt that the decline in deliveries has been a function of lower demand and not supply. .. has far reaching implications for the hypergrowth narrative still embedded in Tesla s share price suggesting material downside risk for the stock. .. we estimate revenue may decline 13 y y in the coming quarter. Reiterate Underweight $115 target $144 now appears inevitable. It either holds there or $102 is tested next. The EV market is in trouble The latest sign is Tesla s layoffs Oh noes 6 000 new vehicle insurance registrations in China last week So sad.. Weekly insured sales data from shows that only sold 6 000 vehicles last week. This is down 52 YoY the same level of volumes as small local EV makers like Aito. Quarter to date Tesla s local sales are 7 907 vehicles down 59 YoY from 19 473 in 2023. Oddly no one on the Tesla BOD has resigned. Of course they are ultimately responsible for the losses at tesla. They are an illegal BOD according to the rules of the and has been deemed as much by Delaware Courts. They must be removed Tesla is blackberry the upstart independent that had the lead and blew it. Cybertruck owners .. 1 do NOT wash your car in sunlight and 2 do NOT tell Tesla SCs that you drove it through a car wash even if you turned on Car Wash Mode. They will void your warranty. Tesla announces new sub $20 000 Tesla Model A 1 year old $60 000 Tesla I m a skeptic of management style at this point says as Tesla delays Cybertruck deliveries. Ever since he left Tesla and bought Twitter basically nobody has been running the ship. How bad is Over the last 5 years she has now returned 7 in she trails the by 88 and by 107 respectively.

2024-04-18,dynaCERT on the Brink of Launching Carbon Credits dynaCERT a global leader in carbon emission reduction technology is on the verge of getting its Verra VCS certification. This certification is a big deal because it will allow $DYA to participate in global carbon credit trading and it underscores the company s commitment to clean technology. dynaCERT recognizes the potential of carbon credits as a strategic asset. By issuing carbon credits to end users $DYA will be able to encourage businesses to adopt its emission reduction technologies by offering real incentives. How Carbon Credits Work Carbon credits are generated by projects that have avoided or removed greenhouse gas emissions. Basically each credit represents one less tonne of carbon dioxide or another greenhouse gas equivalent in the atmosphere. A prime example illustrating the economic benefits of carbon credits is Tesla who has strategically leveraged these credits as part of its business model. Recently $TSLA announced record high sales from carbon credits sales at $1.79B. dynaCERT Carbon Credit Update Looking back at dynaCERT $DYA secured Verra VCS Methodology approval in 2021 and received a final Assessment Report from Earhood in November 2023 confirming its compliance with Verra s standards. Currently $DYA is in the final stages of obtaining VCS certification and once the certification is received the company plans to action some of its exciting plans. $DYA plans to use its proprietary HydraLytica Telematics platform to facilitate the conversion of CO2 emissions. HydraLytica was basically created to monitor fuel consumption to calculate GHG emissions savings. And the best part is that the company plans to share some of the tangible benefits of carbon credits with its end users. In addition the recent adoption of stricter CO2 emission targets for trucks and buses in the EU perfectly aligns with dynaCERT s goals further validating the company s mission. The European Parliament has passed new regulations aimed at enforcing more rigorous CO2 reduction targets for heavy duty vehicles. These targets set ambitious goals for significant emission reductions by 2030 and mandate that urban buses achieve zero emissions by 2035. Stayed tuned for updates on dynaCERT s journey towards Verra VCS certification and its impact on the global carbon credit market.

2024-04-19,TSLA top or bottom 2 Again I spent an hour counting TSLA comments on my feed on Twitter. I got around 70 which is more than 35 yesterday. There were some bulls today. And a Gorgon Gecko reference. And a hodl meme that looked like a scene from Braveheart. Highlights below. TSLT bullish struggling to guess the price action before earnings. But I suspect that until we see posts like these we are far from the bottom We believe Tesla is among the leaders in autonomy Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs just released a report to quantify the massive revenue opportunity around Tesla s FSD robotaxi projecting Tesla could eventually derive tens of billions of dollars in revenue from FSD subs or up front purchases. once you go FSD you never go back Kinda worth reading. Adam Jonas thinks Tesla may be exiting the car business yet maintains his $310 price target... TSLZ bearish A DOG WITH FLEAS SPORT Another day another downgrade.

Investors want to hear Why FY 24 volume growth won t be negative as many analysts including top ranked Adam Jonas predict. Why 1Q auto gross margins are likely bottoming and can improve going forward Timing of the $25K Compact since it helps bridge the gap between the two growth waves to justify TSLA s 60x P E There is no vehicle launching on 8 8 Musk getting a $55B compensation package fixes this .right Nearing the January 2023 gap. Since Tesla announced a 10 global workforce reduction on April 15th more challenges have arisen. According to reports a key Tesla supplier disclosed a 30 decrease in supply to the company. Tesla s Shanghai factory the supplier s biggest customer has consistently placed stable orders in the past year. However Tesla s sudden decrease in order volume has significantly affected the supplier indicating an implementation of substantial production cuts. Tesla s China wholesale volume fell 4 YoY to 220.9k units in Q1 2024. Cathie Wood and Ark Invest bought 66 504 more shares of Tesla today I ve been using FSD the last 10 days. It is not FSD in the least. It got confused at a red light with 3 lanes. It couldn t figure out where to go. It has trouble merging on the highway. It tries to change lanes when it shouldn t. Not ready. The Model 2 is a crucial piece of our thesis. If they stopped that that is investment thesis changing David Baron a portfolio manager at Baron Capital Inc. and son of Wall Street veteran Ron Baron said in an interview. Baron who oversees the $1.4 billion Baron Focused Growth Fund said he will be very surprised if Tesla s Model 2 is taken off the table and said growth will accelerate with the new car. The entire Tesla thesis now rests on FSD become autonomous. Elon made sure of that for as far as we can see with clarity . biggest long is pretty pissed off. He thinks Elon is overpaid that s an understatement. Hopefully he dumps his whole stake and sinks this stock is screwed even if the Model 2 launches as planned it would barely offset the collapse in sales of the aging Model 3 Y. But but muh cash has $29bn in cash but their working capital was $7.2bn in 2023. Imagine if sales decline.

Yet another Cybertruck owner joins the Musked Club Ceiling mounted gear selector falls off completely so Tesla service offers Musked owner sticky tape Other Tesla owners had to apply duct tape to doors to get them to shut properly. Get why is imploding DAN IVES TODAY ON TESLA If they don t pursue the Model 2 and go straight to robotaxis it s like Apple saying they are stopping at the iPhone 15 and to now please wait until the iPhone 25 comes out. Robotaxis can t hit scale till 2030 at the earliest. If they don t pursue the M2 vehicle being a Tesla investor will be like standing on the edge of a cliff and looking down below. Baffled Wall Street analysts simply don t accept that Elon Musk has canceled development of the $25 000 Model 2. They are insisting he produce it.

2024-04-22,We are at the declining cool down phase of Tech We have had a crazy run since October of last year and it seems now we are cooling down for the foreseeable future in major tech stocks. Summary UBS downgrades rating on Big Six tech companies to neutral from overweight. Grouping includes Alphabet Amazon Apple Meta Platforms Microsoft and Nvidia. The group has dropped 8 from its April peak having surged 117 from Jan. 2023 lows. Nvidia fell 10 as AI stocks retreated. Earnings per share growth expected to slow to 16 from 42 . COVID 19 pandemic caused an asynchronous earnings cycle. Deceleration in large cap tech and acceleration in mid cap tech may lead to a reversal in stock leadership. Non tech companies expected to see earnings shift from a 3 fall in Q1 to a 19 fall in Q1 2025. Shift may be disruptive in the short term but UBS reiterates S P 500 target of 5 400 for end of year citing positive fundamentals and a robust economy.

2024-04-23,Are EVs a bad investment right now The EV industry previously recognized as an area of growth and technological advancement now appears to be under considerable pressure. Recent developments reveal a general downturn across the sector with Tesla one of many players implementing significant job cuts. The company has announced a reduction of over 14 000 jobs worldwide particularly impacting its major operations in the U.S. and China. Elon attributes these layoffs to a drop in sales and increasing competition in the EV market. This decision is reflective of broader challenges facing the industry not just Tesla. A recent analysis indicates a significant reduction in job postings among leading EV manufacturers over the past three months. This trend could be an early indicator of the challenges that lie ahead for the sector suggesting a possible reevaluation of growth strategies among these companies.

2024-04-25,$ALLG Nearing Earnings Deadline What happend Not much. Allego delayed their Earnings over missing paperwork. When this happened volume dropped. Allego has be hovering above 1$ comfortably for weeks. Allego just closed a BIG deal with Ford and is expanding rapidly Very volatile stock due to high institutional ownership. Low volume daily. Apollo group backed Expecting some news good growth and solid financial improvement. Prior to the delay volume was crazy and it looked like it was going to exceed 2$ easy. Company overview Allego NV provides and operates EV charging locations throughout Europe. They have all kinds of chargers ranging from slow charging to ultrafast but their focus is fast charging on parking lots. They operate 34.000 charging points throughout Europe. The stock is undervalued. In the US sentiment for EV related stocks is very bad. Most EV stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. This resulted in a big sell off of anything related EV. But this company is not on the US market. It s a European company and the European market is totally different. Sales In Europe EV sales are still growing helped by legislation. Although consumers are still reluctant to buy one big organisations are all switching to EVs. Most big companies or government organisations have strict CO2 reduction goals and switching to EVs is a quick win. The company started in The Netherlands which has been one of the front runners in EV adoption. Bigger countries such as France and Germany were slower to adopt EVs but are catching up rapidly . In these countries there s a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. Only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time so Allego is very quickly winning contracts all over Europe. Their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed Allego to grow FAST at the moment. There s not a lot of competition in Europe some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand alone locations next to the major roads . Financially Third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2 to 28.6 million compared to 22.3 million in the prior year period. Third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0 to 22.0 million compared to 14.4 million for the three months ended September 30 2022. Gross profit increased to 5.4 million compared to million in the prior year period gross margin during the quarter was 18.9 . Third quarter 2023 net loss was million compared to million in the prior year period Operational EBITDA was 2.6 million reflecting higher charging revenue and improved charging gross margin compared to the prior year period loss of million. Allego recently signed two power purchase agreements totaling 100 gigawatt hours of energy per year with Energy Solutions Group the largest independent green energy producer in the Benelux region with renewable energy sourced from a solar park that is expected to be operational in January 2024 and a wind farm that is expected to be completed in January 2025. In October Allego recorded over 1 million sessions per month across its network. $ALLG,reddit,0.9876,0.131,0.063,0.805,0.4340052902698517,0.1274280697107315,0.438566654920578,positive,neutral

2024-05-06,A friendly reminder about buying stocks that could save you thousands. I have a very basic retail account through Webull and only hold 3 stocks but mostly tesla . I use a simple system where each trading day I hop on look at the price then buy a fractional share between $5 $20 based on the price that day. Today I went to do the same as any other day but was shocked to look at the filled order realizing I had accidently bought 8 SHARES of stock on margin and not $8 worth... 1 I made the trade within a few minutes of waking up which was a massive mistake because if I had been more alert I would of likely noticed that it hadn t changed from shares to dollar amount when I had tapped on it to change it. 2 I rushed through the process quickly as it is something I do nearly every trading day. Any stock purchase nomatter how large or small should always be looked over to ensure the details are correct because once the order is submitted it cannot be undone. 3 this is not a viable solution for me because I like to have very fine control over my portfolio but for the majority of people scheduling daily buys instead of doing it manually would be the easiest way to eliminate mistakes like this happening. I had done this in the past and may consider going back to it. 4 for any large purchases I m thinking that they should only ever be made using a proper PC and not ever from mobile. Too much can go wrong on a touch screen when your life savings is potentially at stake. 5 know your trading platform and look through options to see if you can do things like turn off the ability to have margin option buying etc if it is not something you reguraly use. If margin buying had been disabled on my account then it would not of let the purchase go through. Thankfully I own about 30 shares where purchasing 8 on margin isn t a big deal and my MEP is still in the 70 . It may actually end up benefiting me and I am considering maintaining the MEP to around 80 in the future. But I got insanely lucky as only a few days before I purchased $20 of stock and not $8 like I was trying to today. Had I accidently purchased 20 I would of risked having my shares liquidated to cover the costs then also have to pay taxes on gains and it would of basically wiped my portfolio completely out. So use my close call as a friendly reminder to check everything over and make sure something like this DOSN T happen to you.

2024-05-07,More Tesla employees laid off as bloodbath enters its fourth week Tesla s brutal round of layoffs entered its fourth week with more employees posting on LinkedIn and elsewhere about receiving notice that their time at the company has come to an end. The most recent layoffs which were first reported by Electrek and Business Insider appear to be hitting different segments of the company including software services and engineering. Employees said they received layoff notices over the weekend and on Monday. It s unclear how many employees have been affected. Business Insider reported at least seven employees posted about being laid off on Sunday. The layoffs first started last month when Tesla began laying off what was said to be at the time 10 percent of the company s global workforce of 140 000 people. The layoffs included Tesla s head of EV charging Rebecca Tinucci as well as her entire 500 person team. Tesla s head of the new vehicles program Daniel Ho was also let go. On X Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company needed to be reorganized every five years. And in an email to employees he said the company needed to be absolutely hard core about the cuts and that staffers working under executives who don t obviously pass the excellent necessary and trustworthy test would be out of a job. According to Bloomberg Musk privately expressed a desire to lay off at least 20 percent of the company because its quarterly vehicle deliveries fell by that much. Tesla is going through one of its toughest financial situations in years with sales dropping and profits down 55 percent year over year. The company is experiencing increased competition both in the US and in China while also dealing with waning demand for EVs globally. And Musk has been downplaying Tesla s vehicle business in an effort to position the company as a leader in autonomous vehicles promising to unveil a fully autonomous robotaxi later this year.

2024-05-08,TSLA Robotaxi in Mainland China instead of the United States Tesla is betting on Robotaxi this year. Instead of launching in the United States probably Tesla is pushing for a soft launch in Mainland China ... Bullish or bearish EDIT Subsequent to the initial post Reuters published an article indicating that US prosecutors are examining whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers about its electric vehicles self driving capabilities. Seems like Robotaxi by Tesla is still very remote for the US market ... US seeks answers from Tesla in Autopilot recall probe U.S. auto safety investigators are seeking detailed answers and documents from Tesla in a probe into the automaker s December recall of more than 2 million vehicles to install new Autopilot safeguards. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said last month it was investigating after receiving reports of 20 crashes involving vehicles that had the Autopilot software updates installed under Tesla s recall. The agency s letter said it had identified several concerns regarding the recall. Tesla said in December its largest ever recall covering 2.03 million U.S. vehicles or nearly all of its vehicles on U.S. roads was to better ensure drivers pay attention when using its advanced driver assistance system. The NHTSA recall investigation covers models Y X S 3 and Cybertruck vehicles in the U.S. equipped with Autopilot produced between the 2012 and 2024 model years. Tesla which did not immediately respond to a request for comment has said repeatedly that Autopilot does not make vehicles self driving and is intended for use with a fully attentive driver who is prepared to take over and has hands on the steering wheel. NHTSA said it had sent Tesla an information request letter which was made public on Tuesday seeking details of the recall and documents by July 1. NHTSA wants comparative data from Tesla on the performance of vehicles after receiving the recall including the number of hands on wheel warnings issued. The agency said it had concerns after those 20 crashes as well as results from preliminary NHTSA tests of updated vehicles following Tesla s five part recall remedy. One issue under investigation is Tesla s recall allows drivers to set how they activate Autopilot by either allowing a single pull or double pull of the drive stalk. NHTSA s letter said the single pull activation of Autopilot is not the default setting on vehicles that received the remedy in the field and testing showed it was possible to make this change while driving. Tesla has also made additional updates to reduce crashes including high speed captive turn lane collisions that are not part of the recall. NHTSA said it will assess the timing and driving factors behind these updates their impacts on subject vehicle field performance and Tesla s basis for not including them . Last month NHTSA said it found evidence that Tesla s weak driver engagement system was not appropriate for Autopilot s permissive operating capabilities and that this results in a critical safety gap. NHTSA said during its Autopilot safety probe launched in August 2021 that it had identified at least 13 Tesla crashes involving at least one death and many more involving serious injuries in which foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role. NHTSA noted Tesla s December recall allows a driver to readily reverse the software update. Elon Musk proposed to launch robotaxis in China during April visit state media report says Elon Musk proposed testing Tesla s advanced driver assistance package in China by deploying it in robotaxis during his recent visit to the country the state backed China Daily newspaper reported on Wednesday citing sources. Chinese officials told the Tesla CEO that China welcomes Tesla to do some robotaxi tests in the country and hopes it can set a good example the newspaper quoted the sources as saying. However Chinese authorities did not immediately approve its widespread use of Full Self Driving functions the newspaper added. Before the full rollout of its FSD functions Tesla still needs to get approval to collect and transfer data that Tesla s cars need to train its driver assistance features. The newspaper added that this issue wasn t discussed in detail during Musk s visit. A person briefed on the matter told Reuters that Tesla is seeking to apply to launch the robotaxi tests in Shanghai where the company s largest factory globally is located. Tesla and the Shanghai city government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The China Daily report comes shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a whirlwind weekend trip to Beijing late last month where he met Chinese Premier Li Qiang. Musk on the trip intended to discuss the rollout of FSD and whether Tesla could secure government approvals to transfer data overseas that could prove pivotal in its development of autonomous vehicles Reuters previously reported. FSD is the most autonomous version of Autopilot software and was rolled out in 2020. Its features include self parking auto lane changes and traffic navigation. Among the wins during Musk s trip which was first reported by Reuters was a key endorsement from a top Chinese auto association that said Tesla s Model 3 and Y cars were compliant with data security regulations. That would enable local governments to allow Tesla cars into parts of China they were previously barred from Chinese media reported citing a statement from Tesla. Tesla has also reached an agreement with Baidu to use the Chinese tech giant s mapping license for data collection on China s public roads according to two people who at the time described that as a step toward FSD rollout in China. The China Daily newspaper however citing a source close to Baidu said that the deal only meant that the accuracy of Baidu s maps provided to Tesla would be improved and that it had no direct relation with FSD. Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk has abandoned a longstanding goal for Tesla to make affordable electric cars for the masses and is looking to focus on autonomous driving software robotaxis and its humanoid robot Optimus. Last month the company mentioned a purpose built robotaxi product that it planned to build with a revolutionary manufacturing process without offering a timeline for its release. China has been at the forefront in the development of self driving cars and companies such as Baidu and Toyota backed Pony.ai have launched robotaxi services in limited test zones in several cities. In Tesla Autopilot probe US prosecutors focus on securities wire fraud U.S. prosecutors are examining whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers about its electric vehicles self driving capabilities three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Tesla s Autopilot and Full Self Driving systems assist with steering braking and lane changes but are not fully autonomous. While Tesla has warned drivers to stay ready to take over driving the Justice Department is examining other statements by Tesla and Chief Executive Elon Musk suggesting its cars can drive themselves. U.S. regulators have separately investigated hundreds of crashes including fatal ones that have occurred in Teslas with Autopilot engaged resulting in a mass recall by the automaker. Reuters exclusively reported the U.S. criminal investigation into Tesla in October 2022 and is now the first to report the specific criminal liability federal prosecutors are examining. Investigators are exploring whether Tesla committed wire fraud which involves deception in interstate communications by misleading consumers about its driver assistance systems the sources said. They are also examining whether Tesla committed securities fraud by deceiving investors two of the sources said. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating Tesla s representations about driver assistance systems to investors one of the people said. The SEC declined to comment. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Last October it disclosed in a filing that the Justice Department had asked the company for information about Autopilot and Full Self Driving. The Justice Department declined to comment. The probe which is not evidence of wrongdoing could result in criminal charges civil sanctions or no action. Prosecutors are far from deciding how to proceed one of the sources said in part because they are sifting through voluminous documents Tesla provided in response to subpoenas. Reuters could not determine the specific statements prosecutors are reviewing as potentially illegal. Musk has aggressively touted the prowess of Tesla s driver assistance technology for nearly a decade. Tesla videos demonstrating the technology that remain archived on its website say The person in the driver s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself. A Tesla engineer testified in 2022 in a lawsuit over a fatal crash involving Autopilot that one of the videos posted in October 2016 intended to show the technology s potential and did not accurately portray its capabilities at the time. Musk nevertheless posted the video on social media writing Tesla drives itself thru urban streets to highway streets then finds a parking spot. In a conference call with reporters in 2016 Musk described Autopilot as probably better than a human driver. During an October 2022 call Musk addressed a forthcoming FSD upgrade he said would allow customers to travel to your work your friend s house to the grocery store without you touching the wheel. Musk is increasingly focused on self driving technology as Tesla s car sales and profit slump. Tesla recently slashed costs through mass layoffs and shelved plans for a long awaited $25 000 model that had been expected to drive sales growth. Going balls to the wall for autonomy is a blindingly obvious move the billionaire executive posted on his social media platform X in mid April. Tesla shares down more than 28 so far this year surged in late April when Musk visited China and made progress toward approvals to sell FSD there. Musk has repeatedly promised self driving Teslas for about a decade. Mere failure to realize a long term aspirational goal is not fraud Tesla lawyers said in a 2022 court filing. LEGAL CHALLENGES Prosecutors scrutinizing Tesla s autonomous car claims are proceeding with caution recognizing the legal hurdles they face the people familiar with the inquiry said. They will need to demonstrate that Tesla s claims crossed a line from legal salesmanship to material and knowingly false statements that unlawfully harmed consumers or investors three legal experts uninvolved in the probe told Reuters. U.S. courts previously have ruled that puffery or corporate optimism regarding product claims do not amount to fraud. In 2008 a federal appeals court ruled that statements of corporate optimism alone do not demonstrate that a company official intentionally misled investors. Justice Department officials will likely seek internal Tesla communications as evidence that Musk or others knew they were making false statements said Daniel Richman a Columbia Law School professor and former federal prosecutor. That is a challenge Richman said but the safety risk involved in overselling self driving systems also speaks to the seriousness with which prosecutors a judge and jury would take the statements. FATAL CRASHES Tesla s claims about Autopilot and FSD have also drawn scrutiny in regulatory investigations and lawsuits. Safety regulators and courts have raised concerns in recent months that corporate messaging about the technology including the brand names Autopilot and Full Self Driving have imbued customers with a false sense of security. In April the Washington State Patrol arrested a man on suspicion of vehicular homicide after his Tesla with Autopilot engaged struck and killed a motorcyclist while the driver looked at his phone police records show. In a probable cause statement a trooper cited the driver s admitted inattention to driving while on autopilot mode ... putting trust in the machine to drive for him. In Washington state a driver remains responsible for the safe and legal operation of that vehicle regardless of its technological capabilities a state patrol spokesperson told Reuters. The same month the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into whether a Tesla recall of more than 2 million vehicles in December adequately addressed safety issues with Autopilot. NHTSA declined to comment. The recall followed a long running probe opened by regulators after cars with Autopilot engaged repeatedly crashed into vehicles at first responder emergency scenes. Regulators subsequently examined hundreds of crashes where Autopilot was engaged and identified 14 deaths and 54 injuries. Tesla disputed NHTSA s findings but agreed to the recall which employed over the air software updates intended to alert inattentive drivers. The NHTSA investigation found a critical safety gap between drivers expectations of Tesla s technology and the system s true capabilities according to agency records. This gap led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes.,reddit,0.9929,0.093,0.064,0.843,0.055186349898576736,0.2475675791501999,0.6972460746765137,positive,neutral

But there is a nugget in the Sec filings. Net loss from 305 Million to 98 Million. Call me crazy but Allego is running toward profit in a matter of months For the year ended December 31 2023 the Registrant expects subject to potential adjustments as a result of the completion of the annual audit to report a net loss of approximately 98.2 million compared to a net loss of approximately 305.3 million for the year ended December 31 2022. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to improved operational performance and a substantial decrease of share based payment expenses following the listing in 2022. Ford Allego team up for fast EV charging at dealers across Europe Allego Enters Into Partnership with Burger King France to Enable Its Restaurants to Provide Ultra Fast Charging Reinforcing Allego s Leading Position in France Company overview Allego NV provides and operates EV charging locations throughout Europe. They have all kinds of chargers ranging from slow charging to ultrafast but their focus is fast charging on parking lots. They operate 34.000 charging points throughout Europe. The stock is undervalued. In the US sentiment for EV related stocks is very bad. Most EV stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. This resulted in a big sell off of anything related EV. But this company is not on the US market. It s a European company and the European market is totally different. Sales In Europe EV sales are still growing helped by legislation. Although consumers are still reluctant to buy one big organisations are all switching to EVs. Most big companies or government organisations have strict CO2 reduction goals and switching to EVs is a quick win. The company started in The Netherlands which has been one of the front runners in EV adoption. Bigger countries such as France and Germany were slower to adopt EVs but are catching up rapidly . In these countries there s a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. Only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time so Allego is very quickly winning contracts all over Europe. Their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed Allego to grow FAST at the moment. There s not a lot of competition in Europe some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand alone locations next to the major roads . Financially Third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2 to 28.6 million compared to 22.3 million in the prior year period. Third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0 to 22.0 million compared to 14.4 million for the three months ended September 30 2022. Gross profit increased to 5.4 million compared to million in the prior year period gross margin during the quarter was 18.9 . Third quarter 2023 net loss was million compared to million in the prior year period Operational EBITDA was 2.6 million reflecting higher charging revenue and improved charging gross margin compared to the prior year period loss of million. Allego recently signed two power purchase agreements totaling 100 gigawatt hours of energy per year with Energy Solutions Group the largest independent green energy producer in the Benelux region with renewable energy sourced from a solar park that is expected to be operational in January 2024 and a wind farm that is expected to be completed in January 2025.

2024-05-09,NIO s Strategic Charge in the Global EV Market Investing in NIO despite its current operational losses and significant debt levels can be considered a forward looking strategy particularly for those who are bullish on the future of electric vehicles and renewable technologies. NIO s debt is largely a reflection of its aggressive investment in research and development infrastructure and expanding production capabilities. These investments are critical for gaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving EV market. By financing growth and innovation NIO is positioning itself to capture a significant share of the global EV market which is expected to grow substantially. NIO is not just focusing on the Chinese market but is also eyeing expansion into Europe and potentially other international markets giving it more growth opportunities. The automotive industry is undergoing a significant transformation moving away from fossil fuels to electric and hybrid vehicles. This shift is expected to continue due to the decreasing cost of batteries improved EV infrastructure and increasing societal awareness about climate change. However the journey to other countries such as America does not come without challenges especially with the giant EV manufacturer Tesla running the show. Tesla has a strong brand presence in the U.S. recognized for pioneering the electric car industry and backed by high profile CEO Elon Musk. Tesla s brand is associated with innovation quality and sustainability aspects that resonate well with American consumers. NIO while a recognized brand in China and some parts of Europe would need marketing efforts to establish similar recognition in the U.S. For NIO to compete effectively it will need to differentiate its vehicles through unique features possibly focusing on its innovative Battery as a Service model advanced autonomous driving capabilities and superior interior luxury which are some of NIO s strong suits. Tesla s extensive Supercharger network provides a significant competitive edge in the U.S. where infrastructure is a critical factor for EV adoption. NIO would need to either build its own charging infrastructure form alliances with existing networks or innovate around this challenge perhaps by emphasizing its battery swap technology which provides a full battery charge in a matter of minutes as opposed to longer charging times at a typical EV station. Navigating the U.S. regulatory environment can be challenging particularly for a foreign company amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over trade and technology transfer. NIO will need to manage these aspects carefully ensuring compliance with U.S. regulations and possibly facing higher tariffs or trade barriers that could affect pricing and competitiveness.

2024-05-09,Tesla announced firing of all its Supercharger team slowing charging stations installements. The smallcaps to be benefited by this big news are few. Tesla lead the first quarter installements with 75 market share but Elon Musk fired all the Supercharger team and halted the further expansion. A huge gap is created while the competitors are fast growing but mostly indebted mid caps with losses so they will need funds aka dilution to cover any demand. Also due to restrictions like BABAA Act the imports can t be used. In the field of smallcaps the only debt free with cash in hand and 2024 expected profitability is Pioneer Power PPSI. In contrast with the other stocks this one trades at a P S far below 1 and a very low PEG. Its stock price is near its lows for two reasons first because its Q4 2023 were less good than expected and secontly because investors are in wait see mode until the Q1 2024 results which according to the analysts will be good in terms of revenues more than $10M and EPS of $0.05. Other similar stocks can t be mentioned here as their revenues are those of a microcap but their valuations exeed the $300M of a smallcap because the charging industry is so promising and already fast growing.,reddit,0.9542,0.146,0.079,0.774,0.08151515573263168,0.3977763056755066,0.5207085013389587,positive,neutral

2024-05-10,Elon Musk backtracks on Supercharger network halt says more chargers coming Last week Tesla s CEO fired nearly the entire 500 member Supercharger team. Tesla s partners are demanding answers with competitors waiting in the wings. Leave it to Tesla CEO Elon Musk to add more chaos to a situation that he ostensibly created in the first place. In a tweet on X early Friday morning Musk addressed concerns many have had over his recent move to shrink down Tesla s Supercharger team. Just to reiterate Tesla will spend well over $500M expanding our Supercharger network to create thousands of NEW chargers this year Musk wrote. That s just on new sites and expansions not counting operations costs which are much higher. Shortly thereafter Musk also started a Supercharger Community on X where members can discuss and share stories on the topic. Whether Musk s proclamation that Tesla is still heavily investing in the Supercharger is accurate or not is another story but the industry investors and EV owners are seeking clarity and demanding answers. Last week Musk and Tesla laid off nearly the entire Supercharger organization which was responsible for the build out of its best in class charging network. In the aftermath of the initial layoffs Musk addressed the Supercharger news on X stating that the network will grow at a slower pace for new locations. Automakers like GM Ford Kia Polestar Stellantis Honda and others had signed up to access the Supercharger network and incorporate Tesla s NACS plug inlet in their future vehicles under the promise that the Supercharger network would continue to grow at a steady pace. Tesla was likely getting an earful from its NACS partners questioning what they were getting exactly after signing deals to access the Supercharger network. In addition contractors and others working with Tesla on existing Supercharger projects were getting their emails bounced back with no feedback on what to do next. Tesla also apparently backed out of leases at four upcoming Supercharger sites in New York per EV blog Electrek. Charging network provider EVgo told Yahoo Finance that it was actively engaged in the development of the NACS network and was adding more locations to take advantage of Tesla s move to backtrack its expansion. EVgo competitor Blink Charging is also poised to move on the opportunity claiming potential Supercharger customers contacted Blink about future orders in the wake of Tesla s move. Even oil and gas stalwarts like BP are moving in on Tesla. With its BP Pulse charging network the company said it is aggressively looking to acquire real estate to scale our network which is a heightened focus following the recent Tesla announcement.

2024-05-10,Chinese EV maker Zeekr s shares open 24 above IPO price Chinese EV maker Zeekr s shares open 24 above IPO price SUMMARY First major Chinese listing in the U.S. since 2021 Chinese EV makers looking to boost exports Shares of EV makers have been hit hard of late Shares of Zeekr Intelligent Technology opened nearly 24 above their initial public offering price on Friday giving the China based electric vehicle maker a valuation of $6.8 billion. The debut would mark the first major U.S. listing by a Chinese company since 2021 amid fierce competition in China between electric vehicle makers that have hurt their profits and as many push to expand into other markets. The capital markets in New York are very favorable for new energy vehicles. Zeekr is a global brand and choosing to list in New York further demonstrates its global capabilities said CEO Conghui An who is also the president of Zeekr s parent company Geely Holding Group. Zeekr is the premium brand of the Chinese automaker which also owns Sweden s Volvo Cars and the UK s Lotus. It was formed in 2021 to tap into growing Chinese demand for premium models and has delivered nearly 200 000 cars so far according to its IPO filing mostly in China. Zeekr is one of a number of Chinese automakers including BYD SAIC and Great Wall Motor that are targeting Europe rolling out electric models as they seek to compete with legacy European automakers on their turf. Chinese EV sales in Europe have soared in recent years. An said Geely aspires to become the Volkswagen Group of this era of new energy vehicles comparing the company to Europe s top automaker. Within Geely Zeekr s mission is to address the luxury EV market segment according to An. The stock debut comes as U.S. President Joe Biden gears up to announce new tariffs targeting China EVs Reuters reported. The measures could also include other strategic sectors such as semiconductors and solar equipment. Zeekr s stock opened at $26 compared with its IPO price of $21. Shares of EV companies in the United States have lost substantial value in recent months including Tesla the leading U.S. EV maker which has dropped 30 this year. Rivian Automotive has lost 85 since its IPO in November 2021 while Lucid Group is left with a fourth of what it fetched when it signed a deal with a blank check firm earlier that year. Zeekr however upsized its IPO indicating strong demand from investors. It sold 21 million American depositary shares to raise $441 million. It had earlier planned to sell 17.5 million ADSs at a price between $18 and $21 apiece. Since the start of the year the company s deliveries have overtaken its nearest competitors. Zeekr delivered 49 148 vehicles in the first four months ended April 30 while Xpeng delivered 31 214 units and Nio delivered 45 673 cars during the same period according to regulatory filings and press releases. The share flotation comes during rising tension between the world s two biggest economies over trade intellectual property Taiwan and China s stance on the Russia Ukraine war. The IPO gives Zeekr a fully diluted valuation which includes securities such as options and restricted stock units of $5.5 billion at the high end of its targeted range but still lower than the $13 billion it fetched after a funding round last year. The discount to last year s valuation could help draw in investors said Dan Coatsworth investment analyst at AJ Bell. They re able to buy into a growing business at a fraction of last year s valuation. Everyone loves a perceived bargain. The number of Chinese companies that have pursued stock market flotations in the United States in the past few years has dropped after Chinese ride hailing giant Didi Global was forced to delist its shares following a backlash from Chinese regulators. Beijing has since softened its stance and released a set of rules last year to revive such listings after the U.S. accounting watchdog and China resolved a longstanding audit dispute in December 2022.,reddit,0.9839,0.092,0.033,0.875,0.048386815935373306,0.8972485065460205,0.0543646402657032,positive,negative
2024-05-10,These are the stocks on my watchlist Hi I am an ex prop trader that trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here or none of them on any given day. I might trade stocks that don t appear on here I hold no positions in any stocks long term but Amazon Mag7 general broad market indices. . If you re on old reddit click show images at the top to see all the charts quickly. I usually make these watchlists premarket but can be delayed if I m trading the open. These aren t mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy sell. Many stocks I post are $500M market cap. Most are NOT good long term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like Thoughts on will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. News worth mentioning We might have a geomagnetic storm that will affect electronics such as GPS mobile phone networks power grids etc. Fed also commented that inflation data has been disappointing and that it is too early to think about cutting rates we might have 0 rate cuts this year. US will impose tariffs on China EVs likely early next week. Worth watching NIO BYD TSLA etc. SG Reports .23 vs .21 expected EPS revenue is 157.9M vs 152M exp. Overall met expectations. However they raised their guidance. AMD Possibly affected due to news about the rate cut trading the most cleanly of all the semis for this news.

2024-05-14,Elon Musk laid off the Tesla Supercharger team now he s rehiring them Two weeks ago Tesla CEO Elon Musk enacted widespread layoffs throughout the company including the 500 strong team responsible for the brand s Supercharger. Now Tesla is looking to hire some of them back Bloomberg reports as Musk promises to spend $500 million expanding the network. The Supercharger network is inarguably Tesla s crown jewel. The company recognized early on that even though its owners slow charged at home each night knowing they had the ability to rapidly recharge on the road was critical in making an electric vehicle an acceptable alternative to existing vehicles. Since then it has built out more than 2 000 charging stations in the US alone with more than 25 000 plugs. More than that the chargers invariably work something that is often not true for other charging networks. So successful is the Supercharger network that over the course of last year virtually every other automaker that sells or plans to sell EVs in the US has announced it will drop the CCS1 connector for the J3400 standard originally developed by Tesla. But those announcements were about more than just switching plugs. Each time the OEM also revealed it had negotiated access for its customers to the Supercharger network. That made Musk s dismissal of the entire team responsible so hard to fathom. While the Supercharger network accounts for only about 5 percent of Tesla s revenues that percent is poised to grow as more OEMs gain access. And although the charging experience for Tesla EVs at Superchargers is usually flawless that s because it s optimized for a single make of car with just five different models there s no guarantee that will prove true when cars from other brands try to charge. The layoffs also appeared to put Tesla s plan to build a more powerful charger that would benefit cars using 800 V or 900 V architectures including Audi Porsche Lucid and others on hold. Worse yet dozens of Supercharger sites that were in the works have stalled out according to multiple reports. But last week Musk announced that Tesla would spend more than $500 million building out more chargers just days after saying the focus would instead be on uptime at existing locations. And to do that Tesla will need to rehire a whole bunch of people. That started with Max de Zegher who was an executive under the previous head of Supercharging Rebecca Tinucci. This is not the first time Musk has had to back track an impetuous business decision. In 2019 he decided to close all of Tesla s retail locations to pay for a cheaper version of the Model 3 sedan. Within two weeks that decision had been reversed in no small part due to the legal consequences of breaking so many leases.

2024-05-15,Tesla s China rival Nio launches a new brand car cheaper than the Model Y Chinese electric car company Nio revealed Wednesday that the first car for its new lower priced brand Onvo will be about $4 000 cheaper than Tesla s comparable Model Y. Deliveries for Onvo s first car the L60 SUV are set to begin in September the company said. Pre sales began after Wednesday s launch event. Nio CEO William Li said he expects Onvo to begin selling its cars overseas at some point but didn t specify when according to an interview with CNBC s Eunice Yoon. Since launching about 10 years ago Nio has focused on the premium segment of cars priced around 300 000 yuan or higher. The company has since expanded to Europe but its monthly deliveries in China have generally remained modest versus the competition. Onvo s L60 starts at 219 900 yuan versus the Model Y s 249 900 yuan. Elon Musk s electric SUV has been one of the best selling pure battery powered electric cars in China. Fierce competition in China s electric car market has invited new entrants and prompted many companies to cut prices. Smartphone company Xiaomi in late March entered the electric car market with its SU7 sedan to rival Tesla s Model 3 with a price that was also about $4 000 cheaper. The Model 3 has since cut its price by about $2 000 to 231 900 yuan according to Tesla s China website. Xiaomi said Wednesday it had delivered 10 000 SU7 vehicles. BYD which sold more cars than Elon Musk s automaker last year when including hybrids mostly sells cars in the range of 100 000 yuan or below. BYD has started to expand into higher price segments in the last few years. Nio CEO Li confirmed to CNBC the L60 is using lower priced batteries from BYD. Global competition from Chinese EV makers has also prompted stiff new tariffs from the Biden administration on imports of the vehicles to the U.S. Chinese EVs will be subject to a 100 tariff the administration announced earlier this week. When asked about the new levies Li called them completely unreasonable noting the impact on consumers and climate goals. That s according to a CNBC translation of the Mandarin. A new standard family car to rival Tesla Onvo aims to set a new standard for the family car Alan Ai president of the Nio sub brand said at Wednesday s launch event in Mandarin translated by CNBC. The brand s name stands for On Voyage while its Chinese name Le Dao is meant to evoke a family having a happy time together. Ai made many comparisons to the Model Y and other cars during his presentation. He claimed the L60 s interior was more spacious than that of Tesla s Model Y and Toyota s Rav4. He also showed videos that claimed Onvo s new car had better shock absorption and cut tighter figure eights than those of competitors. Onvo s advertised driving range on a single charge is at least as far as or even further that of the Model Y depending on the version. As a sub brand Onvo vehicles can access many of Nio s battery swap and charging stations Ai said. He also showed videos of Onvo models using driver assist technology to navigate through country roads and city streets. Tesla s driver assist software Full Self Driving isn t available in China yet but is widely expected to be nearing Beijing s approval for rollout.

2024-05-16,Baidu s robotaxi unit expects to turn profitable next year Baidu s robotaxi unit expects to turn profitable next year KEY POINTS Chinese tech company Baidu said Wednesday its Apollo Go robotaxi arm expects to turn profitable next year. Baidu is one of the major players in China s nascent robotaxi market and received permission from a Beijing city district to begin charging fares in November 2021. Apollo Go operated about 839 000 rides in the last three months of 2023 according to Baidu s latest earnings report. The company is due to release quarterly results Thursday. Chinese tech company Baidu said Wednesday its Apollo Go robotaxi arm expects to turn profitable next year. The projection comes as Elon Musk has emphasized his plans to build up Tesla s robotaxi efforts amid a decline in revenue. Baidu is one of the major players in China s nascent robotaxi market and received permission from a Beijing city district to begin charging fares in November 2021. While most of the cars still have a human staff worker inside for safety the same Beijing district officially let Baidu and start up Pony.ai charge fares for robotaxi rides with no staff in the vehicle in September 2023. Apollo Go operated about 839 000 rides in the last three months of 2023 according to Baidu s latest earnings report. The company is due to release quarterly results Thursday. About 45 of the orders in the fourth quarter in Wuhan were fully driverless up from 40 the prior quarter the company said. In addition to growing usage and reducing labor costs per ride Baidu is making the cars cheaper. Baidu on Wednesday announced Apollo s 6th generation robotaxi will cost around 200 000 yuan or less than half that of the prior generation the company said. This year Baidu plans to deploy 1 000 of those 6th generation robotaxis in the city of Wuhan where the company already operates a number of vehicles without any human staff inside. With decreasing costs and increasing orders Apollo Go s unit economics is nearing break even expected to achieve balance in the fourth quarter of 2024 and turn profitable by 2025 Baidu said in a press release. Rival robotaxi operator Pony.ai is preparing for a listing outside mainland China according to the China Securities Regulatory Commission website in late April. Others in the auto industry remain more skeptical about fully driverless cars which require broad regulatory approval in order to operate. Xpeng Vice Chairman Brian Gu told reporters last month he didn t expect robotaxis to be a real business for at least five years.,reddit,0.9572,0.056,0.011,0.933,0.6260927319526672,0.053323984146118164,0.3205832540988922,positive,positive

2024-05-19,As Tesla layoffs continue here are 600 jobs the company cut in California As part of Tesla s massive restructuring the electric vehicle maker notified the California Employment Development Department this week that it s cutting approximately 600 more employees at its manufacturing facilities and engineering offices between Fremont and Palo Alto. The latest round of layoffs eliminated roles across the board from entry level positions to directors and hit an array of departments impacting factory workers software developers and robotics engineers. The cuts were reported in a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification or WARN Act filing that CNBC obtained through a public records request. Facing both weakening demand for Tesla electric vehicles and increased competition the company has been slashing its headcount since at least January. CEO Elon Musk told employees in a memo in April that the company would cut more than 10 of its global workforce which totaled 140 473 employees at the end of 2023. Previous filings revealed that Tesla would cut more than 6 300 jobs across California Austin Texas and Buffalo New York. Musk said on Tesla s quarterly earnings call on April 23 that the company had built up a 25 to 30 inefficiency over the past several years implying the layoffs underway could impact tens of thousands more employees than the 10 number would suggest. According to the WARN filing the 378 job cuts in Fremont home to Tesla s first U.S. manufacturing plant included people involved in staffing and running vehicle assembly. There were 65 cuts at the company s Kato Rd. battery development center. Tesla didn t respond to a request for comment. Among the highest level roles eliminated in Fremont were two environmental health and safety directors and a user experience design director. In Palo Alto home to the company s engineering headquarters 233 more employees including two directors of technical programs lost their jobs. Tesla has also terminated a majority of employees involved in designing and improving apps made for customers and employees according to two former employees directly familiar with the matter. The WARN filing shows that to be the case with many cut from the team at Tesla s Hanover Street location in Palo Alto. Tesla faces reduced demand for cars it makes in Fremont including its older Model S and X vehicles and Model 3 sedan. Total deliveries dropped in the first quarter from a year earlier and Tesla reported its steepest year over year revenue decline since 2012. An onslaught of competition especially in China has continued to pressure Tesla s sales in the second quarter. Xiaomi and Nio have each launched new EV models which undercut the price of Tesla s most popular vehicles. Tesla s stock price has tumbled about 30 so far this year while the S P 500 is up 11 . Musk has been trying to convince investors not to focus on vehicle sales and instead to back Tesla s potential to finally deliver self driving software a robotaxi and a sentient humanoid robot. Musk and Tesla have long promised customers self driving software that would turn their existing EVs into robotaxis but the company s systems still require constant human supervision. Other recent job cuts at Tesla included the team responsible for building out the Supercharger or electric vehicle fast charging network in the U.S. Tesla disclosed plans in its annual filing for 2023 to grow and optimize its charging infrastructure to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. Tesla said in the filing that it needed to expand its network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer demands after other auto companies announced plans to adopt the North American Charging Standard. Since cutting most of its Supercharger team Tesla has reportedly started to rehire at least some members a move reminiscent of the job cuts Musk made at Twitter after he bought the company and later rebranded it as X. Musk told CNBC s David Faber last year that he wanted to rehire some of those he let go.

2024-05-21,Luminar is an interesting stock to pay attention too If you look at their technology they are way ahead in the solid state LIDAR. They are down significantly but with Volvo using them leads me to believe that their parent company will use them as well. It recently leaked Tesla bought 20M worth of sensors. The fear is Tesla is just using it for a comparison test or to reverse engineer as much as it can without breaking patents. With Volvo alone and what I assume with be Geely using them as well with the stock this low it seems like it should be ready to pop once Volvo proves it in their new SUV and then it cascades to the rest of their lineup for self driving. The dream will be that Tesla finally admits LIDAR is necessary for their ambitions and they arnt buying them for just stats but buying them because a solid state laser may make their ambitions possible. They well then buy them in mass. Regardless they have enough patents and technology to be attractive to buy. So this stock will either just stay as it has been or it will pop up big . Or it ll go to lower prices and get bought by a major auto maker which will bring it back to this low price.,reddit,0.8452,0.121,0.078,0.801,0.11191055923700333,0.028206991031765938,0.8598824143409729,positive,neutral
2024-05-21,which Stocks and Markets are the safest for the next 10 years and Which ones have potential Giving current world circumstances weather changes and disasters that have affected developing and already developed countries like Qatar and Arabia and of course wars. investing in Gold and World Currency is not that great for garaunteed annual profit to benefit a little or a lot within 10 20 years and retire early anymore. Stock in S P 500 is considered a safe option still in my opinion. But companies like Apple and Tesla Microsoft are they likely to keep rising considering we as a civilization have hit the top of the pyramid in terms of advancing technology Nothing is really new anymore so you re bascially profiting from inflation from the need of people of these monopolic companies and markets basically you re profiting from the Hype of these companies. but China is slowly stealing the market away from the states and european markets and we can clearly see that in creating Electric Cars BYD for example it s damn succesful and growing to be even more succseful. So is there a risk of them stealing other markets as well therefore making companies like Apple and Microsoft risky to invest in long term now. whoever invested in those companies in the past 5 years benefited greatly but now i see it s hit the top. or did it not and it will still rise and is still safe So my question is which markets are safest to invest in long term Maybe lithium related stocks as the rise for creating Lithium run cars is the next hype now and second question what is a Meme type hype rising stock that could or could not grant great profit shortly or long term which are the real ones with explanation please so we can all discuss and come down to a conclusion.,reddit,0.8919,0.14,0.098,0.762,0.09810692816972733,0.026354465633630753,0.8755385875701904,positive,neutral

2024-05-24,Why do people feel the need to disclose they hold Mag 7 stocks I m talking about posts where a person makes a bull case for a Mag 7 stock and then ends it with something like Full disclosure I own shares of META and NVDA . Or I knew insert Mag 7 stock was a screaming buy at $x and bought some there. Fact is if you have a 401k that invests in an S P index fund or if you DCA into VOO or whatever other S P fund you re into then Mag 7 is already your primary holding. And I would guess one or both of those scenarios cover 95 of the people who post here. Look at VOO. 28 is Mag 7 I own Mag 7 comments sound as bizarre as I breathe air or I drink water . We all do. Nothing special about it. The exception is if you own a ridiculous amount like people who have $1M of NVDA now that they first started buying in 2011. Also if anyone feels bad they didn t buy META at $100 or NVDA at the end of 2023 they shouldn t because they actually did buy there if they were actively contributing to their 401k or Roth. $x,reddit,-0.5659,0.042,0.058,0.9,0.02592988684773445,0.0697980672121048,0.9042720198631287,negative,neutral

I remember talking to my friends and coworkers about how Elon was going to take over the planet with EVs and improve everyone s lives. I was proud to be a Tesla shareholder. That was all I talked about for months. I read all the press releases earnings reports and niche forums to extract information about the company s future. I even flew to some of their events lol. Nowadays it feels like most people care less about what the companies they invest in stand for. 1. Do you guys still feel proud to be shareholders of XYZ 2.

2024-05-27,OUST If you had to only buy 1 stock for 2024 this is it. I have made many posts about OUST and I have made good money on all of them. I will try and make a mega post here for why you should be BUYING shares of OUST and holding till 2030 or later. 1. OUST just JOINED the RUSSELL 3000 look on page 4 here 2. OUST gives 0 fucks about PR they almost never drop it GOOD or BAD. 3. OUST is everywhere in all fields from cave exploring to driving a tractor tank YES a FUCKING TANK We are proud to announce our strategic expansion into the military markets of Norway and Sweden. HOW LONG BEFORE WE ARE IN THE U.S. MILITARY All links below have VIDEOS you should watch. WE SEE YOU. You take the bus or train WE GOT YOU. How LIDAR and AI interact with a human. I would watch a whole move done like this. I found this crazy to think about but he is not wrong watch the video. Would you rather have cameras watching you and recording your looks or a computer image that tracks everything and everyone and not race based. Oh you ski or snowboard WE GOT YOU. Oh you like trees and forest stuff WE GOT YOU. Oh you recycle WE GOT YOU. Oh you got boats WE GOT YOU. Oh you want to go caving in the ice in a volcano or just under ground WE GOT YOU. Oh you got a farm WE GOT YOU. Oh you got a warehouse WE GOT YOU. Oh you drive trucks WE GOT YOU. If you made it this far I left the biggest and best for last you ever leave your house and get on any ROAD IF SO WE GOT YOU. If you don t know whats coming you will get left behind like trash. Most or the world will start buying OUST in about 3 5 years when it is well over 100 a share and I will be on to my next move years ahead of the random people who know nothing of how LIDAR is going to change our lives forever. 4. The CEO is awesome at what he does he also keeps buying shares he also doesn t pay himself like an asshole so when he buys share it means a lot more then lets say Elon Musk buying some TSLA. 5. Now that OUST is in the RUSSELL 3000 every month lots of BIG MM funds will be buying OUST by BUYING the RUSSELL 3000 and ETFs. Now on to a little rant.

2024-05-31,Top proxy advisor ISS recommends against Elon Musk s $56 billion Tesla pay package Top proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday recommended Tesla shareholders vote against the re approval of CEO Elon Musk s $56 billion pay package and withhold their support from the re election of News Corp. scion James Murdoch to the automaker s board. Tesla s shareholder meeting is on June 13. The report a copy of which was obtained by CNBC comes after the other influential proxy advisor service Glass Lewis also recommended shareholders vote against Musk s pay package. Tesla s board is seeking shareholder approval to reinstate Musk s pay after a Delaware court voided the package earlier this year. ISS said cautionary shareholder support was merited for Tesla s plans to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas although the proxy advisor also warned that there are concerns over how Tesla s board decided to reincorporate and over the unknown nature of Texas s business law framework. The proxy advisor recommended support for some shareholder proposals that Tesla management opposes including one that would declassify Tesla s board. A classified or staggered board is considered by some advisors to be an effective defense against a takeover bid. At a mega cap company like Tesla what is perhaps even more relevant to shareholders is that a staggered board can hinder shareholders from holding directors accountable for poor responsiveness ISS said of its support for the declassification proposal. Pay package push Tesla has been courting shareholder support in both time tested and novel ways. The company engaged communications firm FGS Global and proxy solicitor Innisfree M A to win votes and has bolstered apparent grassroots support from its large network of social media influencers. The company also launched a website VoteTesla.com and has offered shareholders the chance to win a tour of Tesla s Gigafactory facility in Austin. Tesla seeks shareholder approval for Musk s payday and concurrently to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas. The company has characterized the Delaware chancery court ruling that overturned Musk s stock package as unfriendly to shareholders noting the value that Musk has created for investors. Over the last several years it has become clear that Delaware is no longer the right jurisdiction for us Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in a letter to shareholders earlier this week. Tesla has adopted tactics other companies have used in contested shareholder meetings whipping votes and launching a concerted public relations effort to win support. While Tesla is not facing any sort of meaningful organized opposition to its efforts to reincorporate or re approve Elon s pay package some shareholders have come out against it. Billionaire Leo KoGuan has repeatedly said he will vote against the package. KoGuan says he owns around 0.75 of Tesla shares worth around $4.9 billion. Proxy advisor pull ISS and its smaller peer Glass Lewis are an important factor in how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Their recommendations are closely watched in contested situations but are not definitive calls. Still they have developed a reputation for being important bellwethers and seek to advocate for shareholders. They ve also been the direct target of Musk s ire. Earlier this year on an earnings call he compared ISS to the terrorist organization ISIL also known as ISIS. Musk also said they effectively control the stock market on X in 2023 saying they had outsize influence over so called passive or institutional shareholders. Institutional shareholders like BlackRock and Vanguard however do not always vote with ISS recommendations. While voting decisions are generally not disclosed until well after a shareholder meeting those institutional shareholders have due diligence teams that help them decide how to cast the millions of shares they manage on behalf of their investors. ISS in its report said its prior concerns over the pay package which dates back to 2018 had not been mitigated and that it remains excessive noting that the board has effectively only offered shareholders an all or nothing option in this vote. The proxy advisor alluded to Musk s myriad other business ventures such as social media platform X his AI startup xAI and SpaceX as another reason why Tesla shareholders should not support the pay package. The grant in many ways failed to achieve the board s other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders as opposed to other business endeavors and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders ISS said.

2024-06-02,How and what are the best way to financially analyze growth companies Hey folks I have a question how to analyze a growth company. For example. How should we approach fundamentally with companies that are literally creating the market Or rapidly expanding the market . In mature companies it s easy for us to value invest. But growth investing.. I tried finding some things online but no luck yet. I am assuming that the investor really needs to know the market in which the growth is happening to truly evaluate the potential of the company. For example. If someone works in the energy industry and understand the high energy demand of data centers and also understands how nuclear can provide such demand then I guess that would be it. But for an outsider how should one go about it,reddit,0.9515,0.175,0.042,0.783,0.06217200309038162,0.020892711356282234,0.9169352650642395,positive,neutral

Perhaps counterintuitively I ve found it more useful to read listen to tech business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends than solely financial analysts and stock pickers. Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals but are backward looking. However valuation is forward looking thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages so we must consider both. Math In 2023 I also started practicing math daily in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I d done any meaningful math. I m not sure how much but it feels like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging but personally rewarding whether it has helped or not. Conviction A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long term. However someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths. Conviction investing works for me because even when building products I ve always been strong with product vision strategy and always building for the future so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots but I m happy I did. A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once in a generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial. This is another reminder that success is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise you must seize them. Patience As a result of my convictions I m much more patient in my investing these days and don t react to the day to day. I wouldn t be surprised if I don t make another trade for the rest of 2024. UPDATE A commenter asked about benchmarks which I failed to include since I don t pay attention to them so I had to look it up I opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S P return is 28 . My cumulative return for that same period is around 215 . The annual rate of return is 77.9 as mentioned in the original post.

2024-06-04,Elon Musk ordered Nvidia to ship AI chips reserved for Tesla to X and xAI Elon Musk claims he can grow Tesla into a leader in AI robotics an ambition that he s said will require a lot of pricey processors from Nvidia to build up its infrastructure. On Tesla s first quarter earnings call in April Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s Nvidia s flagship artificial intelligence chip from 35 000 to 85 000 by the end of this year. He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year in combined training and inference AI. But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla s procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X formerly known as Twitter. By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla Musk pushed back the automaker s receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units or GPUs by months likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead an Nvidia memo from December said. In exchange original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla. A more recent Nvidia email from late April said Musk s comment on the first quarter Tesla call conflicts with bookings and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts. The email referenced news about Tesla s ongoing drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an H100 project at Tesla s Texas Gigafactory. The new information from the emails read by CNBC highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention resources and hefty amounts of capital. A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Critics have said Musk is only a part time CEO of Tesla the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Musk is also the CEO of aerospace company SpaceX the founder of brain computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co. He also owns X which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022 when it was still called Twitter. He launched his AI startup xAI in 2023. X and xAI are tightly intertwined. In a post on X in November Musk wrote X Corp investors will own 25 of xAI. Additionally xAI uses some capacity in X data centers to run some of its training and inference for the large language models behind its chatbot called Grok CNBC has learned. Musk has pitched Grok originally named Truth GPT as a politically incorrect chatbot with a rebellious streak and a would be competitor to OpenAI s ChatGPT and other generative AI services. While Musk juggles his many ventures Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. The company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S. according to the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey which attributed some of the slippage to Musk s antics and political rants. Tesla s stock price is down 29 this year. Rather than discuss EV sales or the massive restructuring underway at Tesla Musk has been encouraging investors to focus on future products that he s been promising for years but has yet to deliver. That includes AI software to turn existing cars into self driving vehicles dedicated robotaxis that can make money for their owners and a driverless transportation network. If somebody doesn t believe Tesla s going to solve autonomy I think they should not be an investor in the company Musk said on the April earnings call. We will and we are. To get there he s said Tesla requires plenty of Nvidia s GPUs which are specialized for AI training and workloads. Those chips are in limited supply due to soaring demand from Google Amazon Meta Microsoft OpenAI and others. Consuming every GPU that s out there Nvidia now the third most valuable company in the world with a $2.8 trillion market cap has said it s hard to keep up with demand. Between the cloud service providers and the companies developing AI models customers are consuming every GPU that s out there Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in May after the chipmaker reported its third straight quarter of more than 200 revenue growth. Huang also said on an earnings call in February that Nvidia does its best to allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily adding why allocate something when the data center s not ready In naming customers that are already using Nvidia s next generation Blackwell platform Huang mentioned xAI on the May call alongside six of the biggest tech companies on the planet as well as Tesla. Musk likes to tout his infrastructure spending at both companies. At Tesla Musk has promised to build a $500 million Dojo supercomputer in Buffalo New York and a super dense water cooled supercomputer cluster at the company s factory in Austin Texas. The technology would potentially help Tesla develop the computer vision and LLMs needed for robots and autonomous vehicles. At xAI which is racing to compete with OpenAI Anthropic Google and others in developing generative AI products Musk is also seeking to build the world s largest GPU cluster in North Dakota with some capacity online in June according to an internal Nvidia email from February. The memo described a Musk mandate to make all 100 000 chips available to xAI by the end of 2024. It noted that the LLM behind xAI s Grok was relying on Amazon and Oracle cloud infrastructure with X providing additional data center capacity. The Information previously reported some details of xAI s data center ambitions. On May 26 xAI said it closed a $6 billion financing round led by many of the same investors who funded Musk s Twitter takeover. The company was incorporated in March 2023 but Tesla didn t disclose its formation at the time and it was four months later before Musk publicly introduced the startup. Conflicts of interest While Musk has said for years that Tesla is a leader in AI he wrote in a post on X in January that he d want more control over the company before pushing further in that direction. I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI robotics without having 25 voting control. Enough to be influential but not so much that I can t be overturned he said in the post. Tesla s latest proxy filing indicates Musk has 20.5 of the company s outstanding shares a figure that includes options awarded to Musk as part of his unprecedented 2018 CEO pay package. A Delaware court has ordered that compensation to be rescinded. Post trial proceedings are ongoing and subject to appeal. If he is unable to reach his desired ownership mark Musk said in the January post he would prefer to build products outside of Tesla. He s already doing that at xAI. Musk s comments at the time rankled some longstanding bulls including the company s largest retail shareholder Leo Koguan and Gerber Kawasaki s Ross Gerber who characterized his demand as blackmail. Joel Fleming a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group said that by letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent. When you have someone like Mr. Musk who is a fiduciary to multiple companies the law recognizes this creates conflict Fleming said. If you owe fiduciary duties to two or more companies that are competing over the same things you may end up channeling corporate opportunity away from one company to another. Fleming who frequently represents public company investors in shareholder disputes said that in such situations other executives would be in the best position to make decisions while those who are conflicted should abstain. That has not historically been the path that Mr. Musk has chosen for himself Fleming said. Musk hasn t been shy about intermingling corporate resources among his companies. For example following his buyout of Twitter Musk enlisted dozens of Autopilot software engineers and other technical and administrative employees from Tesla to help him make sweeping changes at the company. Some employees even work for two Musk companies at once. At xAI Musk has also attracted employees away from Tesla including machine learning scientist Ethan Knight and at least four other former Tesla employees who had been involved in Autopilot and big data projects there before joining the startup. A former Tesla supply chain analyst who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters told CNBC that Musk has always considered his companies as an extension of his persona and believed he can do whatever he wants with them. That includes Tesla s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity where he was chairman and a top shareholder. However the person said redirecting a large shipment of chips from Tesla to X is extreme given the scarcity of Nvidia s technology. The decision means the automaker willingly gave up precious time that could have been used to build out its supercomputer cluster in Texas or New York and advance the models behind its self driving software and robotics.

2024-06-05,Musk Tesla Insider trading question I am not promoting Tesla in any way. Reddit wouldn t give me any other flair options besides NSFW. Sorry. Thanks to anyone who replies. I saw that Musk is apparently under fire for offloading $7.5B of stock during a time when he knew that the company wouldn t meet its targets. He also assured investors that it would be a great end to the year despite knowing the opposite and selling stock. I m somewhat ignorant of the legal specifics and I m more curious about that than the actual Musk situation. I know insider trading is illegal but if you re a CEO or other exec and you know your stock is about to take a hit are you legally required to maintain your position and take the same proportional losses as any other investor Also to avoid getting caught why don t CEOs allow themselves to take very minor losses and then sell I m not advocating that I m just genuinely curious. It seems like a sketchy choice to sell so much stock without incurring losses when losses are incurred by others so shortly after. If a CEO rides a loss for just a little bit and then sells before everyone else is that still insider trading Edit On a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rank this situation People seem to have mixed opinions.,reddit,-0.3166,0.085,0.09,0.825,0.040671881288290024,0.24711757898330688,0.7122105360031128,negative,neutral

2024-06-06,Why Are People Voting Yes on The Musk Compensation Plan After getting smoked in the Delaware court for basically being in bed with his board and failing to properly disclose the feasibility of compensation goals Musk and Tesla are looking to push the pay $50 billion package through again. From my understanding the goals were as follows $20 billion in revenue and achieve a 100 billion dollar market cap. Tesla easily achieved both and it knew it was going to prior to the compensation package . 300 million stock options for these targets seems unreasonable. However that s technically fine if it was negotiated fairly. It is undeniable that the board of Tesla is under Musk s control. Taking a broader look at Tesla It is down 30 YTD. Musk has laid off roughly 10 of its workforce. FSD is still not close to completion. Sales are down YOY. The supercharger team has been largely laid off. Musk has started a company that competes directly with Tesla. So my question is why does anyone want to vote yes on giving 10 of their company to this guy who seems to not even care about Tesla Another question why would anyone invest in a company run like this,reddit,0.7559,0.072,0.033,0.895,0.00889620278030634,0.9503026008605957,0.040801260620355606,positive,negative

2024-06-06,Penny stocks with potential for huge gains Add to watchlist Yo Here are some notes on companies that I have had my eye on recently. I try to post these weekly as I am always researching new picks so please feel free to share ay tickers you want me to check out If it s a good company it will likely end up in a future post . Hope this provides value to someone NTG Clarity Networks Inc. $NYWKF $NCI.V Market Cap 32M Company Overview NTG Clarity Networks Inc. delivers telecom engineering IT networking and software solutions globally. Based in Canada with operations in Egypt Saudi Arabia and Oman they focus on simplifying telecom digital transformations. Why I like the stock NTG Clarity has shown impressive financial growth. For the trailing twelve months ending March 31 2024 they reported $27.7 million in revenue marking a substantial increase from previous years. With a gross profit of $9.2 million it s clear they re managing costs effectively and running an efficient operation. The company s products are designed to make life easier for telecom operators. Their flagship product NTGapps is a digital toolbox that simplifies telecom digital transformation with customizable application templates. It s a solid example of their innovative approach to solving industry challenges. One thing that stands out about NTG Clarity is their geographical reach. With offices in Canada Egypt Saudi Arabia and Oman they re not just a local player. This global presence helps them tap into different markets and spread risk. The company s recent performance has been impressive. They reported record setting quarterly financials with $2.37 million in profit and $11.75 million in revenue for Q1 2024. Their order backlog is around $40 million indicating strong future revenue potential. The demand for their outsourced professional services is a big growth driver. Finally their leadership team is focused on growth and profitability. With a revenue target of $50 million for 2024 and a bottom line profit margin target of 10 they re setting ambitious but achievable goals. Canaf Investments Inc. $CAF.V Company Overview Market Cap 10M Canaf Investments Inc. processes anthracite coal into calcined anthracite which is a substitute for coke mainly for steel and ferromanganese manufacturers. They operate in Canada and South Africa focusing on coal processing and real estate investments. Their subsidiary Southern Coal Ltd. handles the coal processing in South Africa while Canaf Estate Holdings Ltd. manages their real estate investments in Johannesburg. Why I like the stock Canaf s financials look solid. They posted a net profit of CAN$2.9 million for the year ending October 2023 with an operating margin of 12.2 . Their shareholder equity stands at CAN$9 million and they have no long term debt. This strong financial position gives them a good foundation for growth. Their coal processing business is well established. Southern Coal has a proven track record of supplying calcined anthracite to the ferroalloy industries in South Africa. The consistent demand for their product in the steel and ferromanganese sectors is a big plus. Canaf is diversifying its portfolio. Besides coal processing they re growing their real estate investment division. This diversification strategy helps mitigate risks associated with being solely dependent on the coal industry. The company s strategic vision is focused on responsible and sustainable growth. They aim to use their positive free cash flow to expand their anthracite beneficiation business grow their property investment portfolio and invest in new sustainable sectors. This forward thinking approach is encouraging for long term investors. Their historical data supports their growth narrative. Since 2016 Canaf has seen a steady increase in revenue and shareholder equity with debt levels remaining minimal. This trend underscores their capability to manage growth sustainably and profitably. American Salars Lithium Inc. $USLI.CN Market Cap 8M Company Overview American Salars Lithium Inc. is focused on acquiring and exploring lithium properties across North and South America with projects in Argentina the USA and Canada. The company rebranded from Blanton Resources Corp. in December 2023 to better reflect its focus on lithium exploration. Why I like the stock American Salars flagship project the Candela II Lithium Brine Project in Argentina stands out with an inferred resource of 457 000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent. Given the steady demand for lithium in various industries this significant resource base offers a strong foundation for future development. Plus its location near major lithium players like Ganfeng and Allkem is strategically advantageous potentially simplifying logistics and collaboration . The Blackrock South Lithium Brine Project in Nevada is another asset worth noting. It s strategically placed near the Tesla Gigafactory and other key lithium operations. This proximity could be beneficial for future developments and partnerships making it a noteworthy asset in their portfolio. On the financial side the company raised $844 999 in April 2024 and $580 000 in May 2024 through private placements. These funds are allocated for exploration and development primarily at Candela II showing strong commitment to advancing their projects . New CEO Robert Nick Horsley brings over 19 years of experience in finance and M A. Alongside him the newly appointed CFO Daryn Gordon adds significant mining sector expertise . Additionally with only 20.145 million shares outstanding American Salars has a lean capital structure. $NYWKF $NCI $CAF $USLI,reddit,0.9994,0.205,0.02,0.775,0.6862494945526123,0.01026222389191389,0.3034883141517639,positive,positive

2024-06-08,Investanswers TSLA 8k per share prediction Firstly I m not sure if this is the right sub to talk about Tesla stock if it is what do you guys think of the above prediction. I watched a video made by this Tesla bull investanswers and his stock price prediction for Tesla is 8k per share. He was modelling all the future business that Tesla will get into. For example Energy storage humanoid robots FSD robotaxis etc. I only ask this question over here in this sub because I wanna hear the community s thoughts. As it stands Tesla has a total shares outstanding of 3.189 Billion. Something along those lines. And if the stock price were to hit 8k per share the market cap would be around 25 trillion.

2024-06-09,Why is there such risk aversion 98 VOO 2 high risk outperforms with minimal risk or volatility I don t know if it s the bubbles I m in or what social media feeds me but it seems like everyone is either a high stakes crypto AI gambler or someone who only advocates dumping everything into a basic market index and leaving it forever. I haven t used the particular tracker before but I picked the default date ranges and just picked a couple of high risk plays for a two percent allocation . I think there s no denying these were highly volatile and highly valued. But even if they went to zero it would have a minimal impact on the portfolio. But the returns were several percent better than VOO SPDR. And a 98 VOO 2 high risk also outperforms BrkB while being significantly more diversified. I think anyone who s trying to play it safe would be ecstatic to beat the market by 3 by only risking 2 of their allocation. .,reddit,0.933,0.136,0.087,0.777,0.10907044261693954,0.03628930076956749,0.8546403050422668,positive,neutral
2024-06-09,Bear Case Why I believe Alphabet will do everything right and still lose Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue. With the Attention is all you need paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla s lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch. But even if all that happens it won t make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification more than half of Alphabet s revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want plus summaries and links and review aggregates all on voice command why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift. Much of Alphabet s valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo. Ultimately Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive but without a massive moat in a crucial industry it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META MSFT and NVDA.,reddit,-0.8632,0.062,0.094,0.844,0.038106948137283325,0.6658926606178284,0.2960003912448883,negative,negative

So was wondering about this and tried to find some information and have a question specific to results. This is from the official voting page From what I have read so far it appears the result will be declared in the Annual shareholder meeting on 13 jun. Is that correct interpretation If this is not correct do you know when will shareholders get to know about the result Will there also be a call web conference that one can attend to know the results as they are declared Edit This is from investor dot com Musk posted to X Saturday that around 90 of retail shareholders who have voted thus far support awarding him his pay package and reincorporating Tesla in Texas. Tesla has been incorporated in Delaware since 2003. . I checked Elon s feed on twitter but don t see where he mentioned it maybe it s in the comments. Retail or individual investors currently own around 40 of Tesla shares. Institutional investors hold a much larger share of Tesla stock than they did in 2018. Vanguard voted against the Musk pay package in 2018 while BlackRock and many others supported it. The Tesla chief was writing on Saturday in response to news that Norway s sovereign wealth fund which manages around $1.7 trillion in assets has voted against Musk s 2018 pay deal. This is the latest institutional investor that has decided not to support measure ahead of Thursday s meeting. Norges Bank Investment Management owns nearly 1 of TSLA shares In 2018 the Tesla board won approval for Musk s 2018 pay package with 73 of the vote. $TSLA,reddit,0.9739,0.093,0.03,0.877,0.04056254029273987,0.038262881338596344,0.9211745858192444,positive,neutral

2024-06-11,BioLargo Manufactures First Cellinity Battery Cells a Safer Alternative to Lithium ion News Link WESTMINSTER CA ACCESSWIRE June 11 2024 BioLargo Inc. a company that creates and commercializes sustainable technologies to solve tough environmental and cleantech challenges announced that it had succeeded in manufacturing its first Cellinity Liquid Sodium prototype battery cells. Visit to learn more. Cellinity is BioLargo s next generation battery platform designed to provide safe environmentally conscious large format long duration battery energy storage for applications including grid scale storage renewable energy storage charging stations for electric vehicles and a variety of other commercial and industrial applications. Cellinity is not a lithium ion battery rather it uses a unique chemistry involving molten salt electrolytes that imparts substantial benefits over lithium ion chemistry. These newly manufactured Cellinity prototype cells will now be tested and validated for the energy storage and transfer performance claims that were generated in the technology s early stage research and development by its original inventors Far greater safety no runaway fires no risk of explosion Extremely long lasting no performance decrease over thousands of cycles No self discharging no out gassing and no parasitic load for cooling High energy density more energy per unit of weight than lithium batteries All materials can be sourced within North America without the need for rare earth elements. Successfully manufacturing our first battery cells is a pivotal moment in the journey of our battery technology said Dennis P. Calvert President and CEO of BioLargo. The testing and validation of these cells will allow us make claims about the capacity charge discharge rate and other performance characteristics that we believe differentiate our batteries in the marketplace. After testing and validation we will manufacture full scale prototype Cellinity battery modules in 25 and 45 kilowatt hour capacities for further testing and validation. He continued In parallel to our ongoing development of the Cellinity battery we re exploring various financing options that ensure we get paid for and are in control of the engineering and construction of manufacturing facilities. Although initial discussions have taken place we have no agreements in place. We believe a licensing and partnership model to be a better alternative to self financed and self operated manufacturing facilities competing with the likes of Tesla and well suited for community based manufacturing partners focused on underserved communities that are in special need of reliable renewable energy. Our target projects will add value to communities develop workforces stimulate economic development promote grid stability and enable the development and expansion of micro grids around the world. We will fundamentally enable and enhance the adoption of renewable energy. Mr. Calvert finished by saying The world needs a reliable safe and eco friendly alternative to lithium batteries and we believe our Cellinity battery will meet these needs.,reddit,0.9947,0.151,0.028,0.82,0.2661391794681549,0.008737052790820599,0.7251237630844116,positive,neutral

2024-06-12,Fear that I ve already missed out I have a bad tendency to see a company or industry and think heh... I wish I bought in a few years ago. Then rather than buying in with that realization I talk myself out of it. How much more can it really go up I don t know... Examples Netflix and UNH in 2015ish. LLY when it was $200. I ve since watch both explode and its like damn why did I talk myself out of those positions when I knew I still liked those companies Those are the most obvious misses I ve made. I m curious how you determine when you ve missed your opportunity. I m not worried about stocks that I was never interested in. I don t care if I missed Tesla because it was something I never felt I understood enough to want. I dodged a bullet with the marijuana crazy because I didn t think most companies were a safe long term bet. But there were stocks that I wanted to buy but didn t have the liquidity to pick up then when I got the liquidity I m like is now the best time to buy Its already doubled since I was ready to enter. I m currently don t have much liquidity so I m not buying. But by the end of the year I should have $20 30k freed up. And if some of the stocks I m currently interested in go up I might get it in my head that I missed the opportunity already and just put the money somewhere safer. Besides the argument that over an x number of years almost all stocks go up... what other methodology do you use to determine whether you should still buy a stock and when to admit that you ve missed out.,reddit,0.9685,0.131,0.074,0.794,0.05847523733973503,0.08224519342184067,0.8592795133590698,positive,neutral

Robotics Industrial Automation Robotics in manufacturing and logistics use GPUs to handle complex tasks including real time image recognition object manipulation and path planning. Service Robots From healthcare to hospitality service robots rely on GPU powered AI to interact with humans and perform tasks autonomously. 4. Race Towards AGI Major Tech Companies Companies like Google OpenAI and Microsoft are in a race to develop AGI. This requires building and training extremely large neural networks which demand substantial computational resources provided by GPUs. Market Advantage The first company to achieve AGI could gain a significant market advantage driving intense competition and further increasing the demand for high performance GPUs. Implications for NVIDIA Market Position Leadership in GPU Technology NVIDIA is a leader in the GPU market known for its continuous innovation and high performance products. This positions NVIDIA well to meet the growing demand across various sectors. R D Investment NVIDIA s investment in research and development ensures it stays ahead of competitors and continues to deliver cutting edge GPU solutions. Potential for Growth Revenue Increase The diverse and expanding applications of GPUs suggest sustained and potentially increasing revenue streams for NVIDIA. Strategic Partnerships Collaborations with tech giants automotive companies and research institutions can further boost NVIDIA s market presence and revenue. Considerations and Risks 1. Supply Chain Constraints Manufacturing Capacity Meeting the high demand may strain NVIDIA s manufacturing capacity potentially leading to supply shortages and increased prices. Component Shortages Global semiconductor shortages can impact the production of GPUs affecting supply and pricing. 2. Competitive Landscape Rival Technologies Competitors like AMD and Intel are also advancing their GPU technologies which could impact NVIDIA s market share. New Entrants Emerging companies in the AI and semiconductor space might introduce innovative products increasing competition. 3. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations AI Regulations As governments develop regulations around AI and autonomous systems compliance could affect development timelines and costs. Ethical Implications The race towards AGI raises ethical concerns including safety job displacement and privacy issues which could lead to public and regulatory scrutiny. Investment Perspective Given the diverse applications and high demand for GPUs particularly NVIDIA s products the company is well positioned for significant growth. However potential investors should consider the risks associated with supply chain constraints competition and regulatory changes. A balanced investment strategy possibly including a diversified portfolio of tech stocks can help mitigate these risks while capitalizing on the growth potential in the GPU market.,reddit,0.9924,0.127,0.049,0.824,0.802025556564331,0.021307814866304398,0.17666666209697723,positive,positive

2024-06-13,Tesla pops 6 in premarket after Elon Musk says he is set for victory in $56 billion pay vote Shares of Tesla popped in premarket trading after Elon Musk said shareholders are set to approve his controversial $56 billion pay package and a resolution to move the electric carmaker s incorporation to Texas. At 08 12 a.m. ET on Thursday Tesla shares were 6.39 higher in premarket trading. Tesla shareholders have been voting on two resolutions and can have their say up to the company s annual meeting on Thursday. The first measure under consideration is whether to green light a $56 billion pay package that shareholders originally approved in 2018 before being voided by a Delaware judge in January. The second resolution is whether Tesla should transfer its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. That proposal was put forward after Musk asked his followers on social media platform X earlier this year whether Tesla should carry out such a move to a resounding yes. Musk now said that both of these resolutions are currently passing by wide margins without disclosing specifics or his sourcing. CNBC has reached out to Tesla for comment. The initial pay package had aggressive targets for Tesla s financial performance and market value and while the company has turned into one of the world s largest electric automakers a lot has changed since 2018. Tesla is facing slowing growth and increased competition especially from Chinese players. In that time Musk also bought Twitter now called X and has ramped up focus on other projects including in his brain computer interface firm Neuralink and artificial intelligence company xAI. Critics of the pay deal argue that Musk is distracted by his other endeavors and that the package the largest in U.S. corporate history is excessive. More recently they say that Tesla s financial performance has not been up to scratch. Some notable shareholders have said they planned to vote against the deal and top proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis also recommended this step. The California State Teachers Retirement System a massive pension fund likewise objected to the package claiming the sum was too high. Norway s sovereign wealth fund has similarly come out in opposition. Shareholders in favor of the compensation argue that Musk is integral to Tesla s future success and that the billionaire will take his efforts elsewhere if he is not reimbursed adequately. They claim that the pay package has incentivized Musk. Billionaire investor and long time Tesla shareholder Ron Baron said he is voting in favor of the pay package suggesting that Musk is key to the EV maker s future. At Baron Capital our answer is clear loud and unequivocal Tesla is better with Elon. Tesla is Elon he said this month.

2024-06-13,ARK previous predictions for TSLA In light of ARK s recent price predictions for TSLA I thought I would post this as a reference to some of their prior predictions for TSLA. In 2021 ARK posted the above article. They predicted that TSLA would hit $1 400 in 2024. Adjusted for splits that would be $466. Actual value today $184. They continue to predict that by 2025 the stock would hit $3 000. Adjusted for splits that is $1 000. Their worst case scenario for 2025 is $1 500 or $500 adjusted for splits. TSLA would need to almost 3x in the next 6 months to hit their bear case and approx 6x to hit their prediction.,reddit,-0.4019,0.02,0.034,0.947,0.050966598093509674,0.03659362345933914,0.91243976354599,negative,neutral

2024-06-13,VOO and chill but can you really not make smart moves Hello 21 year old here I understand some things have been proven over time like ETFs boglehead philosophy etc. time in the market over timing the market but what about words like be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy When you are young let s say early 20s this is the time to take risks isn t it Every right risk you take now compounds like crazy every mistake You are young you can still recover and learn. I m not saying dump 100 like wallstreetbets gambling but I m talking about investing in stuff you believe in despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued For example I am a software hardware engineering student and I was a gamer as a child. I knew a lot about companies like Intel AMD Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not AMD would blow intel out of the way QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge but if it s enough for me to believe in working for these companies isn t it enough to invest let s say 10 20 Instead of dumping all into HYSA T bills and VTI VOO VXUS etc and using 5 for individual picks If shit goes down market goes down I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes I had 10k savings from my first internship I could have bought these shares I believed so much in but I didn t it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don t think I should work for the tech industry right If tech fails I fail because thats what I m going into and if I can risk my career for a job in such a volatile market then why can t I risk 30 50 of my portfolio in the same tier companies Can someone experienced help me out with these thoughts To me at this age it seems like VOO will get you the american dream comfortably but VOO and good picks will make you rich and if the market really fails dotcom and whatnot you have to keep faith in the market and keep earning some company will rise and if you are in the scene you will know about it right Could people in tech working for cisco or nokia really not see the future of aapl and msft back in the early 2000s Was it really that blinding,reddit,-0.9205,0.102,0.122,0.776,0.0480850450694561,0.05053647607564926,0.9013784527778625,negative,neutral

2024-06-14,Musk says robots could make Tesla $25 trillion company more than half value of S P 500 The entire value of the S P 500 currently stands at $45.5 trillion according to FactSet. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on Thursday that his company s Optimus humanoid robots could eventually make the automaker worth more than half of that. Musk who characterized himself as pathologically optimistic at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting in Austin Texas said Tesla is embarking on not just a new chapter in its life but is about to write an entirely new book. Optimus appears to be one of the main characters. Tesla first revealed its plans to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event trotting out a dancer in a unitard that looked like a sleek androgynous robot. In January Tesla showed off Optimus robots folding laundry in a demo video that was immediately criticized by robotics engineers for being deceptive. The robots were not autonomous but were rather being operated with humans at the controls. At the shareholder event on Thursday Musk didn t divulge exactly what Optimus can do today. He suggested the robots some day will perform like R2 D2 and C 3PO in Star Wars. They could cook or clean for you do factory work or even teach your children Musk suggested. As for shareholder value Musk said Optimus could be the catalyst for lifting Tesla s market cap to $25 trillion someday. Speaking to a crowd consisting mostly of fawning fanboys in an auditorium at the Gigafactory Musk promised Tesla would move into limited production of Optimus in 2025 and test out humanoid robots in its own factories next year. The company he predicted will have over 1 000 or a few thousand Optimus robots working at Tesla in 2025. This is all far out stuff even for Musk who is notorious for making ambitious promises to investors and customers that don t pan out from developing software that can turn an existing Tesla into a self driving vehicle with an upload to EV battery swapping stations. Getting to a $25 trillion market cap would mean that Tesla would be worth about eight times Apple s value today. The iPhone maker is currently the world s biggest company by market cap just ahead of Microsoft. At Thursday s close Tesla was valued at about $580 billion making it the 10th most valuable company in the S P 500. Musk didn t provide a timeframe for reaching $25 trillion. He did say that autonomous vehicles could get the company to a market cap of $5 trillion to $7 trillion. Musk said he agreed with numbers from long time Tesla bull Cathie Wood the CEO of ARK Invest. This week ARK put a $2 600 price target on Tesla s stock by 2029 betting on a commercial robotaxi business that the company has yet to enter. Wood s price target equals a market cap for Tesla of over $8 trillion. Musk s comments at the annual meeting followed the shareholder vote to reinstate the CEO s $56 billion pay plan five months after a Delaware court ordered the company to rescind the package. The crowd cheered when the proposal was read aloud and when preliminary results were announced. Taking the stage following the readout of the shareholder votes Musk said I just want to start off by saying hot d I love you guys. Tesla shares have dropped 27 this year as the company reckons with a sales decline that s tied in part to an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China. The company has also implemented steep layoffs. Musk has encouraged investors to look past the current state of the business and more toward a future of autonomous driving robots and artificial intelligence. Among his boldest claims on Thursday was Musk s declaration that Tesla had advanced so far in developing silicon that it s surpassed Nvidia when it comes to inference or the process that trained machine learning models use to draw conclusions from new data. Nvidia shares have soared almost nine fold since the end of 2022 driven by demand for its AI chips. The company is now worth about $3.2 trillion. One concern swirling around Musk is his focus on Tesla given all of his other commitments. He owns and runs social media company X is CEO of SpaceX and founded The Boring Co. and Neuralink. He launched another startup xAI in March last year and the company recently raised $6 billion in venture funding. Musk was asked by a shareholder at the meeting how important he is personally to the future of Tesla. I m a helpful accelerant to that future he said emphasizing his role in innovation. He said that when it comes to humanoid robots other companies including tech startups are going after the market. Competitors include Boston Dynamics Agility Neura and Apptronik. What really matters is can we be much faster than everyone else and our product be done a few years before theirs and be better Musk said.

Europe imposed a massive tarriff on Chinese made EV s. Good for Telsa. USA tariff on Chinese cars 100 no competition from china here. Expansion in India is certain just a matter of when.

2024-06-18,NVDA after stock split won t be like TSLA Whether NVDA is overvalued or not is up for debate I have been hearing on Youtube that NVDA will drop after stock split just like TSLA did. Let s look into some figures for comparison regarding NVDA the current market capitalization as of June 2024 is around $3T. This valuation makes NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world by market cap even higher than the peak valuation of over $1 trillion for TSLA. In October 2021 TSLA PE ratio was quite high reflecting its growth expectations and market enthusiasm. The PE ratio was around 250.96 at the end of September 20211 and it likely remained in a similar range throughout October. The forward PE ratio which is based on projected earnings was also elevated indicative of the optimism about the company s future performance. As for NVIDIA as of today the current PE ratio is approximately 77.182. The forward PE ratio which considers expected future earnings is around 46.823 . These values suggest that investors are expecting strong growth from NVIDIA as well.,reddit,0.9812,0.154,0.01,0.836,0.641484797000885,0.2796090245246887,0.07890623062849045,positive,positive

2024-06-19,Selling NVDA with $1m gains I ve decided I m going to sell a portion of my Nvidia stock once I hit $1million profit. As of close today I need an additional 22 increase to hit this threshold so it will likely happen before the end of the month or by the end of summer if things slow down correct. A little back story I bought my first shares in Feb 2017 for $2.77 and again in October for $4.86. I ve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because I thought GPUs would be needed for self driving cars. Little did I know the Ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help Nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world. My total cost basis is $34k and I m sitting right around $850k. Gains are around 2600 which is insane. I still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I m a bit torn on actually selling any of it. If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned well I wouldn t be sitting on the gains I have today. My gut is telling me to only sell 1 3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into. I m also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0 which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true FATfire setup. As with any compounding interest once the snowball gets to this point smaller 2 5 moves really move the needle . Anyways just want to share this with someone since I can t really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship. It s anyone s real guess what will happen with Nvidia in the future so I can t imagine anyone can persuade me one way or another on this trade. I ve experienced similar gains on Tesla but failed to sell at the top and now only have a portion of my gains on that stock so I know when a bubble feels like a bubble and this is definitely in that territory now.,reddit,0.986,0.116,0.028,0.856,0.07663481682538986,0.041344862431287766,0.8820203542709351,positive,neutral

2024-06-20,3 Penny stocks that are going to a dollar SOON $ Stocksy s weekly DD Hey guys. I appreciate all the comments on the previous posts some of the tickers suggested were actually pretty solid. KULR has been the most suggested ticker for me to check out for awhile and here it is. As always please feel free to suggest any companies you want me to check out KULR Technology Group Inc. $KULR Market Cap 66M Company Overview KULR Technology Group develops and commercializes thermal management technologies for electronics batteries and other components. Their products serve markets such as electric vehicles energy storage battery recycling transportation cloud computing and 5G communication devices. Company Highlights KULR had a solid 2023 with a 146 revenue increase to $9.8 million and a customer base that grew from 36 to 53. This growth shows rising demand for their tech. Looking at Q1 2024 revenue was steady at $1.75 million. What stands out though is the 769 jump in contract services revenue to $1.13 million indicating a strong demand for their specialized services. They more than doubled their revenue generating customers which is a promising sign. They did see gross margins drop to 29 but they managed to cut SG A expenses significantly and almost halved their R D expenses. One of the most compelling aspects of KULR is their partnerships.

KULR has also launched an online marketplace for their SafeCASE and SafeSLEEVE products approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation and accepted by UPS for battery transport. They ve delivered power cell batteries for AI enabled drone missions in Ukraine and customized battery solutions for the U.S. Army to enhance tactical operations.

Gross profit also saw a solid increase to $11.9 million up from $2.5 million the previous year showing their effective cost management. In Q1 2024 the company continued to perform well. They reported $8.4 million in revenue an improvement from $7.2 million in Q1 2023. What is important though is that their gross margin saw a juicy increase reaching $2.6 million compared to just $746 000 in the same quarter last year. This shows they are scaling operations efficiently while managing costs. Their cellular concrete products are particularly impressive for their high strength to weight ratio resistance to hydrocarbons and durability against freeze thaw cycles. These features make them ideal for applications like road construction and utility insulation. For example the resistance to hydrocarbons ensures stability even when exposed to oil or gas spills which is crucial for long term infrastructure projects. The company operates through three subsidiaries CEMATRIX Inc MixOnSite USA Inc and Pacific International Grout Company. This structure allows them to manage and scale operations efficiently across North America. Additionally they have received approvals from multiple transportation authorities which shows their credibility. Some positive client testimonials display their effectiveness in reducing project costs and timelines. For example one client reported saving over 5 000 man hours and accelerating their schedule by seven weeks due to Cematrix s efficient product application. American Salars Lithium Inc. $ASALF $USLI.CN Market Cap 7M Company Overview American Salars Lithium Inc. focuses on exploring and developing high value battery metals projects catering to the growing electric vehicle market. Company Highlights American Salars stood out to me due to its resource rich projects and strategic acquisitions. Their Candela II Lithium Brine Project in Argentina holds an inferred resource of 457 000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent positioning them well to meet the rising lithium demand from the EV sector over the next few years. The recent acquisition of the Pocitos 1 Lithium Salar Project along with Pocitos 2 adds an inferred resource of 760 000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent. The proximity to essential infrastructure enhances the project s value. Moreover completing the environmental and social baseline report for Pocitos 1 and 2 is a significant step towards securing production permits adding credibility to the project. Their Blackrock South Lithium Brine Project in Nevada is another asset worth noting. Its location near the Tesla Gigafactory could open doors for future partnerships and logistical advantages. Financially the company raised $844 999 in April 2024 and $580 000 in May 2024 through private placements. These funds are allocated for advancing exploration at Candela II demonstrating their commitment to developing this project. New leadership has brought in experienced professionals. CEO Robert Nick Horsley with over 19 years in finance and M A and CFO Daryn Gordon a mining sector expert bring valuable expertise to the company. A nice bonus is that the company maintains a lean capital structure with just 23 million shares outstanding suggesting potential for significant upside. In terms of technology their work at the University of Melbourne using Ekosolve DLE technology is impressive. They managed a 94.9 extraction efficiency and produced lithium carbonate with 99.8 purity. This breakthrough could really boost their production capabilities and set them apart. If you are reading this your a real one so suggest a ticker and if it is actually good I will post my thoughts on it in a future post. ty $KULR $CTXXF $CVX $ASALF $USLI,reddit,0.9994,0.171,0.019,0.81,0.5060800313949585,0.021592695266008377,0.4723272919654846,positive,positive

2024-06-22,Tesla internal data shows company has slashed at least 14 of workforce this year Tesla s hefty downsizing since 2023 has reduced its global head count to just over 121 000 people including temporary workers internal records suggest indicating that the automaker has slashed more than 14 of its workforce so far this year. The latest figure is not from precise payroll data but from the number of people who are on Tesla s everybody email distribution list as of June 17 a tally viewed by CNBC. Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent an email to everybody that day. He told employees Over the next few weeks Tesla will be doing a comprehensive review to provide stock options grants for exceptional performance. He added that options grants will also be awarded to anyone who does something outstanding for the company. Tesla s plan to reinstitute options grants after previously pausing performance based equity awards was reported first by Reuters. Tesla s layoffs announcement landed in April when Musk sent out a companywide email telling employees that the automaker would be cutting more than 10 of its staff. Layoffs at that point were already underway. Bloomberg reported that Musk was aiming for a 20 staff cut. Musk indicated that the number could be even bigger. On the company s first quarter earnings call later in April he said Tesla had reached an inefficiency level of 25 to 30 after a long period of prosperity that began in 2019. We ve made some corrections along the way Musk said on the call. But it is time to reorganize the company for the next phase of growth. In a filing for the fourth quarter Tesla said its employee head count worldwide at the end of December was 140 473 a number that represents salaried and hourly staffers. The everybody email list includes temporary workers. At around 121 000 that suggests Tesla has reduced overall headcount by at least 14 since the end of 2023. Tesla didn t immediately respond to a request for comment. In at least one instance Musk s head count reductions went too far. Tesla dismantled its Supercharging team which consisted of hundreds of employees including its leader Rebecca Tinucci. The company later hired some of those people back according to posts on LinkedIn. The broader cuts coincide with a slippage in sales at Tesla as the company reckons with an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China as well as brand deterioration that a recent survey attributed partly to Musk s antics and political rants. For the first quarter Tesla reported a 9 drop in annual revenue the biggest decline since 2012. Across the auto industry EV sales growth slowed this year after two years of rapid expansion. The slide was particularly acute for Tesla whose Model Y was the top selling car worldwide in 2023. A Tesla employee who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive internal issues told CNBC that some factory workers are fearful more layoffs could follow in July depending on second quarter results. A production and deliveries report for the second quarter is expected from Tesla during the first week of July. Musk has promised investors the company will soon publish a new Master Plan which would be his fourth and that Tesla will reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi on Aug. 8. Tesla shares were little changed on Friday at $181.71. The stock is down 27 this year while the Nasdaq is up 18 .

For the week of June 17 23 Tesla s insurance registrations in China totaled 17 400 vehicles up 49 percent from 11 700 in the previous week. According to local reports vehicle registrations in China tend to be slow at the beginning of the month and pick up at the end.

2024-06-25,At what point do you cut your losses I m new to investing. Been doing it about two months and overall have better returns than just leaving the money in a high yield savings account. One of the first trades I did was buying TSLA at about 170. It ended up dropping to 165 or so and I sold to prevent losses. It dropped to the 140s but obviously now it is in the 180s. I accepted a loss when holding for not even that much longer would have made decent profit. After I learned a lesson about patience there I ve been trying to hold but a few choices I ve made don t show signs of rebounding . I m still undecided if I d like to cut my losses and try to invest in something that will give more returns in the meantime or if I hope that the solar sector has a strong rebound in the long term and just continue to hold. In your experience when do you cut your losses Do you have any examples of sells that saved you money or sells that you regret,reddit,0.0258,0.11,0.118,0.772,0.13744106888771057,0.19722619652748108,0.6653327345848083,neutral,neutral

2024-06-27,Rivian The technology merger with VW has awakened the Black Swan pattern. Expectations for both companies are very high and could be a significant step against competitors from the Far East. Will this be enough to keep the German automotive industry competitive The weekly chart currently presents a noteworthy situation. There is a so called Black Swan pattern which in technical analysis stands for a trend reversal. The target determination of this harmonic pattern typically occurs in two retracements. The smaller Fibonacci is the so called conservative retracement. The longer term Fibonacci is called the aggressive retracement. For the technical analyst the cluster zones marked in the yellow boxes are of particular interest as possible price targets. In this context the open gap and the MACD are also noteworthy structurally represented as a head and shoulders formation on the chart. How do you view the merger and do you see a realistic chance for VW to assert itself against BYD and Tesla with this collaboration The chart at least offers a perspective on a fruitful collaboration.,reddit,0.886,0.076,0.009,0.915,0.10861320793628693,0.0209853183478117,0.8704014420509338,positive,neutral
2024-06-27,RIVN To Buy or Not to Buy A Comprehensive Analysis There s been a lot of discussion about Rivian lately with opinions split between supporters and skeptics. Some are even comparing RIVN to Tesla with analyst Gary Black suggesting RIVN today is like TSLA in 2019. Let s break down the pros and cons of RIVN as we know them Positive Factors The main factor is Volkswagen s recent $5B investment which has significantly extended the liquidity runway. Additional key considerations 1. Strong balance sheet with $7.9B cash investments as of Q1 2024 2. New factory in progress tax incentives for existing facility 3. Positive sentiment around trucks and vans with super loyal fanbase 4. R D in Serbia reducing costs 5. Shifting to base platform add ons model 6. New R2 model has more reservations than total yearly production 7. Potential for expanded partnerships. 8. Expected gross profit by year end could boost stock to $20 25 range Thanks to u bluecap for additional insights from previous discussion. Challenges Declining cash balance and high cash burn rate during production ramp up since FY 2022 is a main risk. Competition from established automakers and Chinese EV manufacturers is important to consider as the market becomes increasingly competitive. Valuation Analyst Perspectives Current P S ratio of 1.8x below 3 year average of 3.0x Average 12 month price target from 23 analysts $14.52 Technical Analysis Weekly chart indicates a possible trend reversal Possible interim price targets in identified cluster zones MACD indicates a potential long term reversal Conclusion Rivian s profile has improved significantly addressing previous concerns. The Volkswagen investment is a game changer for risk mitigation. However cash burn remains a concern with negative free cash flow of $1.5B in Q1 2024. The new investment extends the runway to 8 9 quarters reducing immediate financial pressure. I will closely monitor Rivian s performance and how it handles challenges especially from Chinese rivals. What are your thoughts on RIVN Are you buying holding or staying away,reddit,0.9871,0.14,0.039,0.821,0.7520962953567505,0.041820719838142395,0.20608298480510712,positive,positive
2024-06-27,Safe starting plan to get into Futures As well as what to do with my ROTH Hello all I am very confused on how to proceed from the position I am in and so would really really appreciate some advice. I am 19 years old. Firstly for some background I started trading maybe back in 2022 I put in about $2500 in a WeBull trading account and invested in a bunch of big names like AAPL TSLA LMT etc. And I invested some money into some complete no name stocks that I saw on TikTok. By what I would imagine to be completely luck these stocks actually did quite well and they have been in the green for some time now. But yes I know not to take advice from TikTok lol. Fast forward to now I havent touched the account since then and opening it I have made a return of about 16 with about $400 in total open P L. Which I feel like is good maybe I don t know. Anyways the reason I m making this post is because I m interested in short term profits I have always wanted to get into options but to be honest it just seemed very tricky and like gambling and so it s always been a I ll learn how to get into it later but a few days ago I heard about something called futures trading and it seems much more simple and I would like to get into it. I have a very superficial understanding of how it works and so I was just hoping to ask a couple questions about it 1. Should I trade futures through a prop firm Especially if I am just starting out don t have a trading strategy Or would I be better off starting with micros my own money 2. On that note how do I go about developing a trade strategy Do I just watch a YT video on different strategies available and pick one My friend told me all strategies will work if I just use discretion but tbh that just made me more confused lol 3. What should I use to trade futures I have heard that Ninjatrader is good. And the next topic comes to my Roth IRA through Fidelity. over the course of a few months back in 2022 I put $200 in it monthly and eventually stopped mainly because I was confused what ETFs I should put my money in. People have told me VOO SPY but then some others said $FXAIX $VOO. Which if any is true Should I invest in all 3 Also is $200 a month enough Should I aim to max for $6500 contributed annually Does it really matter I realize this post is all over the place and I apologize but it s all the more reason I would appreciate some answers and so that I know where to go moving forward. Thank you very much $FXAIX $VOO,reddit,0.9962,0.139,0.026,0.835,0.04655739665031433,0.0376424603164196,0.9158000946044922,positive,neutral

2024-07-01,Tesla s Q2 deliveries expected to fall but could the key figure be energy storage Tesla announced global vehicle deliveries for the second quarter on Tuesday with total deliveries expected to fall short of current expectations. However with demand for electric vehicles slowing in 2024 and the artificial intelligence boom dominating the market perhaps Tesla s second quarter energy storage numbers should also be cause for concern. The company deployed a record 4 053 megawatt hours of energy storage capacity in the first quarter. Tesla now offers solar panels and solar rooftops as well as power walls for energy storage. On the commercial side Tesla also offers a Super Battery Pack. Tesla s energy business may be uniquely positioned to benefit from the accelerating investment in the U.S. power grid driven by the AI boom as Generative Artificial Intelligence increases energy demand. Tesla Energy is valued at $36 per share or about $130 billion. Tesla Energy s revenue will reach about $7 billion this year up 20 from 2023. Tesla Energy s profit margins will surpass the company s auto margins in 2024. So I think Tesla s energy business should be focused on as well don t you think,reddit,0.9954,0.261,0.026,0.713,0.3999488353729248,0.13703176379203796,0.4630194306373596,positive,neutral

2024-07-02,TSLA Between two major growth waves means low growth or actually no growth 2024Q2 Production 410 831 Delivery 443 956 but beating WS estimates at 438 019 Indeed the delivery number had been declining for two consecutive quarters yet it has beaten the market consensus resulting to another 5 pump in the pre market. That being said no growth is still acceptable LOL typical TSLA PS Historical P E goes above 100x today good show. Tesla Vehicle Production Deliveries and Date for Financial Results Webcast for Second Quarter 2024 In the second quarter we produced approximately 411 000 vehicles and delivered approximately 444 000 vehicles. We deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products in Q2 the highest quarterly deployment yet. Tesla will post its financial results for the second quarter of 2024 after market close on Tuesday July 23 2024. At that time Tesla will issue a brief advisory containing a link to the Q2 2024 update which will be available on Tesla s Investor Relations website. Tesla management will hold a live question and answer webcast that day at 4 30 p.m. Central Time to discuss the Company s financial and business results and outlook. Tesla reports 443 956 deliveries in second quarter a 4.8 decrease from last year Tesla shares jumped on Tuesday after the company posted second quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers that beat analyst expectations. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439 000 in the three months ending June 30 according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter fell 4.8 from 466 140 a year earlier but rose 14.8 from the first quarter. The stock rose more than 9 Tuesday in midday trading. Before the report Tesla shares were down 16 in 2024. Tesla s quarterly deliveries fall less than expected shares rally Tesla on Tuesday reported a smaller than expected 5 drop in vehicle deliveries in the second quarter as the electric carmaker s price cuts and incentives helped mitigate cooling demand. Shares of the world s most valuable automaker rallied more than 10 on Tuesday hitting the highest level in nearly six months. The higher than expected deliveries data greatly assuages concerns regarding softening EV demand CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson said. The stock continues to ride a wave of positive momentum following its annual meeting in mid June in which shareholders re approved Musk s 2018 compensation plan he said referring to CEO Elon Musk. Everything below this line was written before the release of P D numbers TSLA is going to release its 2024Q2 P D numbers in the next couple of hours WS analysts think that total delivery could reach 438 019 . In my opinion 438K is still far too high based on continuous checking shared by a lot of non WS analysts which is supported by the data regularly released in Mainland China Europe and the United States. The educated estimates should be ranging from 415K to 420K implying at least 9 YoY decline. Recall in January 2024 s investor call that Mr. CEO was saying TSLA is between two major growth waves while no further guidance was provided does it mean low growth or actually no growth More information will be followed post the release of 2024Q2 numbers ... Tesla deliveries set to fall for second straight quarter Tesla s June quarter deliveries likely fell 6 the first time the top EV maker is set to post two straight quarters of decline as it deals with stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models. The company is expected to deliver 438 019 vehicles for the April to June period according to an average estimate based on forecasts from 12 analysts polled by LSEG seven of whom slashed their expectations in the past three months. The EV maker is expected to announce the results on Tuesday. Tesla has hit a speed bump after years of rapid growth that helped make it the world s most valuable automaker. It warned in January that deliveries growth in 2024 would be notably lower as a boost from months long price cuts wanes. Tesla s June China made EV sales down 24.2 y y Tesla s June sales of China made electric vehicles fell 24.2 from a year earlier to 71 007 data from the China Passenger Car Association showed on Tuesday. Deliveries of the U.S. automaker s China made Model 3 and Model Y vehicles fell 2.2 from May levels.

2024-07-02,Diversify once you hit a gain threshold Hey everyone I m 25M and have been putting all my spare money after expenses into the stock market. I only had to pay half of my college so that was really helpful but I ve been working a lot of jobs and internships since 16 which helped too. So I started investing 7 years ago and have seen an annualized return of 16.1 . I bought Nvidia Apple Tesla Microsoft and others in the first couple years and have seen incredible returns from them. My question is if you would recommend I diversify any of my gains. For example I put 1k into Nvidia and now it s around 10k. But now my stock portfolio is not that diversified because of some large gains between a few stocks I have are holding all the weight. Is there a threshold in the gain where you start taking out and diversifying For example if I make 500 return on a given stock anything over I would invest in something else. Just want to hear your thoughts because I m still young and haven t been around too long in the market. I want to use this money for retirement and I m a pretty stable investor .

2024-07-02,Tesla reports 443 956 deliveries in second quarter a 4.8 decrease from last year Tesla just posted its second quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024. Here are the key numbers Total deliveries Q2 2024 443 956 vehicles Total production Q2 2024 410 831 vehicles Tesla s numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439 000 in the three months ending June 30 according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8 from 466 140 a year earlier. Troy Teslike an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans predicted deliveries of 423 000 for the quarter. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories Model 3 and Model Y vehicles and all other vehicles but doesn t report numbers for individual models or specific regions. Tesla s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan. In April Tesla reported a drop of 8.5 in first quarter deliveries to 386 810 the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13 decline in year over year revenue for the quarter primarily due to lower average selling price. Sluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla s factory in Germany as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts Tesla said. But the sales drop also correlated with Tesla s aging lineup of vehicles increased competition from other EV makers especially in China and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk s antics and political rants. Tesla shares are down 16 in 2024 even after rallying 6 on Monday. Tesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales. In China Tesla is currently offering a zero interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China representing 22.5 of total sales. Colin Langan an analyst at Wells Fargo issued a report on Monday saying the firm sees declining delivery growth driven by lower demand diminished return on price cuts. He recommends selling Tesla shares. Wells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla not including environmental credits to fall given the likelihood of more price cuts lower volumes as the year continues. Investor focus will now shift to Tesla s second quarter earnings report later this month and a separate marketing event planned for August when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or CyberCab.

2024-07-02,When will Tesla no longer be considered just a car company When will Tesla be not considered just a car company I m fairly uneducated in the stock world and I m hoping someone can shed some light on this. I m really hoping for genuine discussion. I m not trying to start anything toxic. I commonly see online that people say Tesla is just a car company despite their energy division and in the future potential AI income. My question is at what point is Tesla actually not just a car company anymore I have a few ideas 1. When they sell more of X product compared to cars. 2. When their revenue with X product is higher than car revenue 3. Will they always just be known as a car company because that s how they started out Is there any substance to Tesla even being considered not just a car company anymore Am I totally off base here I m asking this today because their Q2 2024 deliveries came out at 444k cars delivered AND 9.4Gwh of energy deployed. If you converted the energy storage deployment to cars it ends up comparable to 56k additional cars. Math is below $300 kWh 9.4 GWh $2.82 Billion. At an ASP of $50k $2.82B $50K 56 400 Cars This seems relatively substantial.,reddit,0.7832,0.052,0.017,0.931,0.04840102046728134,0.04314955323934555,0.9084494113922119,positive,neutral

2024-07-03,Tesla Set for a New Bull Run as Deliveries Turn Around and Energy Storage Powers the AI Era Whenever investors are disappointed with Tesla Elon Musk surprises short sellers with a big move. On Tuesday Tesla posted stronger than expected Q2 deliveries hinting at a turning point for weak demand with an upside in Q3 deliveries. Additionally energy storage deployments doubled quarter over quarter potentially helping to meet the vast electricity demand that comes with AI. These factors are enough to bring in a substantial influx of Tesla bulls. Thanks to these developments Tesla surged over 10 on Tuesday with its market value reaching $737.5 billion maintaining a six day rally and breaking another resistance level which is always a bullish sign. From April s low Tesla shares are now up 67 . Q2 Deliveries Slightly Exceed Expectations Amid Record June Deliveries from Chinese EV Makers Zero Interest Car Purchases Expected to Drive Crazy Q3 Demand According to Tesla s delivery data released on Tuesday the company delivered 440 000 new vehicles in Q2 down 4.8 year over year but up 15 quarter over quarter and better than the market s expectation of 439 300 vehicles. The total production in Q2 was about 411 000 cars resulting in a delivery production gap of 33 000 cars compared to 46 000 cars in the previous quarter . Tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of German factories and the Red Sea conflict which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short term supply struggles to meet demand which is obviously more exciting than excess supply. Considering that Chinese EV makers such as NIO ZEEKR and Leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in June this implies a significant recovery in demand for Tesla. The company also launched a major campaign on Monday introducing five year zero interest financing for Model 3 Y and other preferential policies. Specifically users who place an order before and including July 31 can avail themselves of a no down payment deal with an initial down payment of 79 900 yuan the daily installment for the Model 3 RWD and Long Range AWD will be as low as 85 yuan and 107 yuan respectively while the Model Y RWD and Long Range will be as low as 95 yuan and 118 yuan per day. Users who make a down payment of 45 900 yuan can opt for a five year low interest plan . The Chinese market accounts for about 22.5 of Tesla s revenue and if this measure is implemented in other countries in the future it would indeed be a massive move. This also adds a new narrative for Tesla s Q3 growth. Energy Storage Deployment Doubles Benefitting from AI Era Both NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have pointed out that the future development of artificial intelligence is closely related to energy and storage. While Tesla s AI business has yet to show tangible benefits its energy storage business is poised to become a pillar of AI in the future. Tesla reported that it deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products in Q2 setting a new record for quarterly deployment more than double the 4 GWh in Q1 and the company s energy storage deployments in the first half of the year almost matched the total for last year. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas praised As Gen AI acceleration spurs a multigenerational increase in energy demand electricity generation and data center investment we believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy which we value at $36 per Tesla share as the business is uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the U.S. electric grid accelerated by the AI boom.,reddit,0.9949,0.131,0.054,0.815,0.8813982009887695,0.06211560219526291,0.05648617446422577,positive,positive

2024-07-05,These are the stocks on my watchlist Hi I am an ex prop trader who trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all the stocks on here or none of them on any given day. I might trade stocks that do not appear on here I hold no positions in any stocks long term but Amazon Mag7 general broad market indices. . If you are on old reddit click show images at the top to see all the charts quickly. I usually make these watchlists premarket but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy sell. Many stocks I post are $500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones.

2024-07-08,How to surpass the fear of selling Long story short I have some unrealised gains on stocks that I bought time ago . I was multiple times on the verge of selling to realise gains that I could invest in another opportunity with better potential. However every time one of these opportunities came up I ended up always retracting and not doing so because I didn t want to give up to the long term perspective I committed when I started in this. Sadly with opportunities I mean Meta falling like crazy 1.5 years ago for the overreaction to the decrease in user registrations Nvidia at 200 or Netflix also dropping to 180 in mid 2022. Recently I was about to do the same to buy a chunk of TSLA. But fear always gets me. I know everything is about risk tolerance. Maybe I am not made for this who knows. However I would be happy to know your opinion about this. I really want to take the chance if I believe that is the right choice. Any state of mind that helps you clicking in the sell button I m just tired of missing opportunities just for being afraid.

2024-07-09,MSFT and AAPL are overvalued and overbought Wallstreet is expecting too much from AI. I got to try Microsoft s copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features nothing ground breaking. This wasn t a major leap in technology like going from fax s to email. Tech companies releasing new upgrades and new products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient yes. Is it applicable for most people i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1 2 actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20 000 employees of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis Maybe 90 wont. If that s accurate a company will only pay for the 10 that need a user license. If chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it. Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40 one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k each as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20 $30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU s are expensive Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins. MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac yeah it drives nice but its overpriced. AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn t worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn t the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren t spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900 for a phone. I wouldn t be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio. That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow we are too early. This is going to take some time. I agree with Ken Griffin on this the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for they re mediocre at best. There s too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company s bottom line. The real winners are semi s data storage and anything surrounding it. There is one area that will benefit astronomically from AI but that will come a bit later.,reddit,0.9975,0.133,0.023,0.845,0.05467873439192772,0.10436947643756866,0.8409517407417297,positive,neutral

2024-07-11,RIVN What are your thoughts I ve been paying attention to Rivian and I m holding for the long term. Historical performance has been poor they IPO d way over valued to raise funds but what they re doing is expensive. It s no news that they re hemorrhaging money citing a loss of $40 000 per vehicle sold . But in the last 3 months they ve had some very promising announcements. During the recent investor day webinar they talked about how Gen 1 was all about proof of concept but now they re moving onto Gen 2 which is about manufacturing efficiency. They detailed how they reduced components steps and fasteners to decrease production and assembly costs. It all sounds very good. In addition they just entered a deal with VW for $5 Billion and all Rivian is supplying to VW is software. It s a stepped plan $1B up front and additional investments based on performance. If they reduce manufacturing costs as they predict and lower sale price as they promised I m thinking this stock could be ripe for big growth. They re the only company competing directly with Tesla and on the consumer side it s going well. I doubt we ll ever see a RIVN selling at comparable prices to TSLA but I could see them over $100 in a few years if they continue to make advancements. Thoughts I m in at $11 share.,reddit,0.9141,0.096,0.052,0.853,0.23362188041210175,0.028340701013803482,0.7380374073982239,positive,neutral

Two days later she purchased 10 000 shares of NVDA. Finally she disclosed the sale of 2 000 shares of Visa on July 1. $800 strike post split is insane.

2024-07-11,Tesla Fantasies and Industry Corruption I was trying to figure out the reasons for the TSLA runup. Saw many talking writing about short squeeze so called analysts like Ives talking about robotaxi others talking about energy etc. It s all over the place. All trying to justify the crazy multiple expansion of this stock. Most are convinced Tesla will achieve L3 L4 L5 autonomous classification to support robotaxi as it has been sold to us. ALL of them I say again ALL of them ignoring the fact that Tesla cars cannot achieve Level3 certification WITHOUT a backup system such as LIDAR. Therefore Tesla will never get L3 certified unless the US state motor vehicle regulators change the laws around this and I highly doubt it will happen anytime soon. Equally I don t expect Tesla to start adding LIDAR since it would cut into their profit margin. Assuming that by some miracle they actually achieve L3 L4 L5 is a huge leap forward and required for robotaxi. I genuinely believe there is corruption that persist here. Much cheaper to bribe other people to spread lies throughout the internet about the future of tesla robotaxi fantasy. I know I sound like a consipracist. So someone please explain to me what is wrong with everyone including financial professionals promoting this Tesla robotaxi lie EDIT 1 As I engage further on this topic I saw this post referenced elsewhere. Very interesting to note. EDIT 2 Just read the robotaxi day is being delayed. Surprised,reddit,0.9303,0.121,0.069,0.81,0.035816777497529984,0.16628724336624146,0.7978960275650024,positive,neutral
2024-07-11,Why do people take Elon s word seriously Not a blind Elon hating post I promise. Elon now has made several commitments that he s failed to deliver on.

2024-07-11,Nike is a bargain right now Right now these prices are an absolute fire sale. Maybe I missed the part where people are going to stop buying nike worldwide. Apparely Nike has less going for it than it did in 2018 I mean just look at this chart below that covers 10 years You have a volume read of 129 996 982 on June 28th. Right now the markets are highly infactuated with tech stocks and things like TSLA or PLTR. Something boring like Nike is far from the excitement anyone is looking for as new ATH s are being made every day on QQQ or SPY. Theres nothing sexy about it at all. This is where the best prices can be obtained. No one wants the stock. So few people want the stock that they are willing to actually sell it at prices first seen May 25th 2018. Even in 2020 with a full blown pandemic breaking out with unknown consequences only saw Nike hang out below this price for a whopping 7 trading days. Lil trip down and V shape recovery. Even from a pure volume only perspective the following shows some interesting things The lowest volume day is about 15.95M for any day since the big drop. The volume on the day of the big drop is unprecedented. The 2nd highest volume day in the last decade was 12 23 2015. Hilariously almost around the same price The high of that day back then was 68.20 and was a new all time high. The difference with large volume down here is its the opposite. Large amounts of demand are showing up down here. In the past the big volume was correlated with being near big highs. But Nike wasnt even near its high right before it dropped either. So what I would say is that finding a bottom is a matter of flushing people out. You gotta get to that point where even the most committed person who would have a 1 chance of selling pre earnings is now ready to and currently selling. Thats probably going on and we couldn t sport such volume down here if there wasn t some equal demand. The price has not moved much. You have a high there of 79.05 and we are down to about 72 now. Lets just look at the actual income here Over the last 10 years the revenue is only going up. Even if the company is faltering so to speak these prices are far from connected to the reality of actual income. Check out the P E below Even right here you can see that right now Nike is sporting a P E that looks to be just over 20. But its actually even lower and this chart is delayed The last time the P E was under 18.30 was Nov of 2011... Now heres what I do know. Alot of fund managers are going to be looking at these beautiful pictures over the coming weeks months They are going to potentially sell some of those wildly running high stocks. Then they will be sitting on some cash they need to find another play for. All of a sudden seemingly out of nowhere on your favorite stock channel all the analysts will be upgrading nike. Show hosts and guests will be talking about how the stock is too cheap and all that fun fancy stuff they do AFTER they bought the ol dippity skippity. They are going to have to do something with the money. They will see Nike. I doubt they will just pass it up. Since the fed hasnt cut rates yet theres nothing to really worry about. Even when that happens markets should run a good 3 5 further before they tap out from whatever caused the fed to cut in the first place. Now lastly what brought me to this trade idea at all Adobe. How did Adobe lead you to see something in Nike I remember 2022. In 2022 there was a big gap down and this brought Adobe to prices not 1st achieved since Sept of 2018. I passed this one up. I let the fear keep me out of the trade. Surely everyone who was selling was correct. Obviously thats the crowd that always wins. Since we are dealing with panic lets get up close and examine how the panic works The day of panic was mid Sept and a bottom was put in over the next two weeks. It did however fight against going higher. You can see that in those micro higher lows leading into mid Nov where it said goodbye to those lows permenantly. So quite clearly any attempts to make the stock run in the near term should be expected to be stamped out. Espeically if we see a run back up to 78. It will probably have to retest its low whatever it is a couple of times over the coming months. Quite clearly those retests whenever they happen SHOULD end higher on that day as they did with adobe there. That would be a sign of people buying the dip 10 10. It won t happen overnight but I do think the stock could fill its gap within the next 3 4 months. Even if things get bad around the election period Nike already got the business. TLDR Everyone hates Nike so you should love it long time. Thats all you really need to know.,reddit,0.9111,0.073,0.068,0.859,0.04800376296043396,0.20584869384765625,0.7461475729942322,positive,neutral

2024-07-12,How This Door Handle Cost Tesla Half Of My Investment Today I arrived in Bangkok with my girlfriend and ordered us to Grab to get us to the hotel. I ve heard about BYD before and that it s the Chinese Tesla but I d never expected to be driven in one of those cars for $2.63 through the midst of Bangkok traffic for over 30 minutes. If you take a look at the design features and changes Tesla s made over the last couple of years the companies beginning and Elon Musk of course it s obvious that they re trying to revolutionize the electric vehicle market with features like the Yoke Steering Wheel the outer door handles and much much more. However if you look at the company BYD how cheap they are producing their vehicles how amazing the design and the quality is in general you won t be able not to be amazed what China s done in that regard as well. One thing that struck me the most is the inner door handle... Sounds weird but think about it How either unnatural or unnecessarily cumbersome are the inner handles of car doors Either you have to pull the handle with one arm and push the door with the other handle or you bend your fingers in an unnatural angle to the side pulling in a curve to push the door open with your elbow. This might not be one of the most important topics when talking about a car and most people probably never thought of this as a problem or inconvenient but if you ve read the book Atomic habits you might know where I m going with this. James Clear at one point goes into detail about a racing bike team that improved every single little detail in their lifes to get every little advantage over the competition they could get. Needless to say that after dozens of little improvements they became impressively successful making history for their country in this sport. I believe the same to be true for companies their culture their product and their team. And in the case of BYD it definitely applies in a bunch of cases just like it did with Tesla a couple of years ago . I ve been an investor in Tesla since 2016 because I believed in the product and Elon Musk and made good money owning the stock however with Tesla becoming being a blue chip stock not a growth stock anymore the percentage gain is going to be limited compared to BYD which is until now rarely represented in the western world compared to Tesla. Tesla s got a Market Cap of 839.59 Billion vs BYD being at 96.16 Billion which would mean BYD has about an 8x to go until it catches up with Tesla. And I m expecting higher prices on Tesla too... When I talked to a friend at Mercedes a couple of days ago he told me that China s investing so much money into the research of Electric Vehicles and the development of batteries that many European projects and car companies already gave up as they don t have the funding and resources provided by the Chinese Government. Seeing how China s developed over the last 10 20 years and investments into modern technology they ve already passed by most Western countries if they keep that trajectory going they ll be miles ahead 10 years from now.

2024-07-13,What is biggest risks to Yield Max ETF I trade actively and have different accounts for different reasons so my financial literature is relatively well but I still dont see the biggest risks to yield max ETF which is selling covered calls and selling cash secured puts on many famous stocks such as TSLA NVDA Those have good return so I have been buying IRA since taxes wont apply until withdrawal in retirement. I understand how they will pay out the dividend in theory and actually I use similar strategy in SPY but whats the biggest risk here My best guess is that individual stocks goes to 0 by which Yield Max ETF will go into 0 but it s hard to imagine that NVDA will go to 0 in any time soon since they are dealing with big tech or big name stocks with good financial statement and pretty much too big to fail business That makes me think there is virtually no risks but apparently it sounds too good to be true and I am getting cautious. Are there anything I should know on this kind of ETFs Thank you,reddit,0.9752,0.165,0.077,0.758,0.05642985180020332,0.03302522748708725,0.9105449318885803,positive,neutral

This is a daily watchlist for trading I might trade all the stocks on here or none of them and stocks not on here on any given day I only hold MAG7 general broad market indices long term unless otherwise noted in the ticker. If you use old reddit click show images at the top to see all the charts quickly. I usually make these watchlists premarket but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy sell. Some stocks I post are $500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like Thoughts on or Is a good investment will be ignored unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll. News . Same news as above. Private prison stock same news as above. This has bounced so strongly from the down day we had from the announcement of the delay of Robotaxi leaning somewhat bearish towards it. However the markets will likely be bullish today so will remain agile in this. No position right now.

2024-07-15,Is PSNY good now I think PSNY is a good buy. Here is some knowledge for all of the regards who have no idea who PSNY is good luck boy So PSNY better known as POLESTAR is the EV baby of VOLVO. They got spun off and was basically released from them in early 2024 since Volvo said they were positioned for growth. Okay enough with the fucking history lesson The stock has been floating at around $1 USD after being around the $0.70 mark at the end of last month. So they are seeing some positive movement already in the last couple of weeks. This is just due to it being undervalued overall and a correction from what I can tell. As of last week they finally broke above there SMA50 and are showing some signs of a recovery. This is good news for a longer look as they should be able to hold at this $1 mark and not need to deal with delisting. They are expanding into new market and their finances are finally in order. Previously they had some problems with delivering EPS etc but they are now closing the gap on their burn rate and looking towards positivity. The company while not selling a large volume of cars is under valued for the number of cars they sell at the current price point. TSLAs price per car is great than a 5X value while PSNY is less than 1 2X that. Okay I know TSLA is awesome so that s why the price per expect sales is so high well LCID is at 2 1 2X and they haven t been doing so hot so once again this company is undervalued for what they are performing. TLDR stock seems undervalued and is cheap so buy stock and see go up,reddit,0.9903,0.139,0.016,0.845,0.5630202889442444,0.11322364211082458,0.32375600934028625,positive,positive

2024-07-16,1 Is there a process by which info about a stock goes from insider knowledge to widespread knowledge and how that relates to bubbles Warren Buffet once said something like be greedy when others are fearful be fearful when others are greedy There is also the shoeshine boy effect of Joe Kennedy. Supposedly when Joe Kennedy started getting stock tips from his shoeshine boy that is when he knew it was time to leave the market. Supposedly he just made this story up to cover for insider trading but its still a good lesson. I feel like a stock goes through certain steps. At each step the potential gain goes down while the potential losses go up. Is there a name for this process FWIW my money is in index funds so I don t really know a lot about the psychology of the stock market. But it would go something like this step one. Only insiders who work in the industry have specialized knowledge and they can use that knowledge to buy low. This would be examples of insider trading or politicians like Nancy Pelosi buying stocks based on confidential government information about government policy related to publicly traded companies . Knowledge that is public but is very esoteric and hidden. There is knowledge out there about a new technology new policy etc that will affect the stocks price but the only people that know about it are experts in the field. Its public knowledge but only a handful of experts know the info. Knowledge that is public and fairly well known. Basically anyone with google can find the knowledge. Knowledge that is mainstream. The mainstream media reports on the knowledge. Knowledge that causes hype. I guess an example of this would be NVIDIA or Tesla. After a while there was massive hype in these companies and the stock prices didn t reflect their P E ratios. At this point the general public who have no knowledge of stocks jumps on the bandwagon and ends up losing money when the stock crashes. NVIDIA hasn t crashed but it might. With each step the knowledge of the stock becomes more public and the less informed the investors become. Its not a perfect system by any means. Bitcoin went through the last phase of the general public jumping on the bandwagon and crashed in 2021 but it recovered from the crash and is now worth more than it was in 2020. However bitcoin only went above its 2021 peak in the last few months. Bitcoin peaked at 61k in October of 2021 crashed and only went back up to 62k in June of 2024. But stocks like Tesla did drop after they became mainstream good ideas to buy for uninformed investors. However Tesla has had both dips and peaks since it lowered from its peak.,reddit,0.8382,0.067,0.06,0.873,0.04432808235287666,0.10578103363513947,0.8498908281326294,positive,neutral

Should we worry that the stock s market price is extremely overvalued at the moment Personally I think it s going to be a mixed bag.

2024-07-22,Berkshire Hathaway cuts stake in China s BYD to below 5 Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway opens new tab reduced its stake in BYD opens new tab to below 5 in what could be the final time Berkshire discloses stock sales in China s largest producer of electric vehicles. Berkshire lowered its stake in BYD s issued H shares to 4.94 from 5.06 on July 16 according to a Monday filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The stake had been 7.02 as recently as June 11. Hong Kong requires larger shareholders to disclose opens new tab sales when their resulting stakes fall below whole percentage numbers. Disclosures can stop once ownership stakes fall below 5 . Berkshire began investing in Shenzhen based BYD in 2008 when it paid $230 million for about 225 million shares then equal to a 10 stake. It began selling BYD shares in August 2022 after the stock price had risen more than 20 fold and two months after it set a record high. Charlie Munger Berkshire s late vice chairman was the impetus behind the original BYD investment. Berkshire invests mainly in the United States. BYD was founded by Chinese chemist Wang Chuanfu in 1995 as a maker of rechargeable batteries. It surpassed billionaire Elon Musk s Tesla opens new tab last year as the world s largest electric vehicle maker though Tesla has since regained the top spot. In the second quarter BYD sold 426 039 electric vehicles while Tesla sold 443 956. Source,reddit,0.765,0.052,0.023,0.926,0.020181750878691673,0.8185096383094788,0.16130870580673218,positive,negative

2024-07-22,Tesla EV s Reliant on World Copper World Copper Ltd. is in position to benefit from the growing demand for copper worldwide. Both the renewable energy and electric vehicle sectors heavily rely on copper and World Copper is well prepared to meet this demand with an impressive portfolio of copper oxide mining projects. The company s standout assets the Zonia Project in Arizona and the Escalones Project in Chile form the cornerstone of their extensive mineral portfolio positioning World Copper as a key player in the market Zonia Project The Zonia Project is pivotal to World Copper s supply. This project offers robust financial prospects boasting an after tax NPV of $447 million and an IRR of 29 at a copper price of $4.00 per pound. Zonia s strategic location and economic viability make it a cornerstone asset ensuring sustainable growth and significant returns. Its development aligns with World Copper s mission to supply the increasing demand for copper in renewable energy and electric vehicles. Furthermore the proximity to Phoenix makes the project a hotbed for employment opportunities. Escalones Project Located in Chile Escalones is one of the largest emerging copper oxide deposits in the Western Hemisphere significantly contributing to World Copper s strategic initiative. Unlike Zonia Escalones offers immense untapped potential with ongoing development that promises substantial future output. This project positions World Copper to leverage Chile s rich mineral resources and favorable mining environment. Escalones is crucial for the company s long term growth strategy enabling it to meet rising copper demand from the renewable energy and electric vehicle sectors while diversifying its asset base. Other Important Highlights 1. Market Demand Copper is critical for future technologies with a projected supply deficit of 22 billion pounds per year by 2035. World Copper stands to gain from rising prices amid the surge in demand for years to come. 2. Sustainable Practices The use of the SX EW process in copper extraction minimizes environmental impact and aligns with global sustainability trends. 3. Experienced Team Led by seasoned professionals like Derek White and Myron Smith the management team brings extensive expertise in mine development and regulatory navigation. I believe there s growth to be found as well as favorable upside potential for World Copper. As the world continues to look to reduce environmental damage with growing renewable energy practices and increased EV production the rise may be forthcoming for $WCU Communicated Disclaimer No Financial Tidbits Allowed Sources $WCU,reddit,0.9935,0.164,0.042,0.794,0.7898788452148438,0.008020375855267048,0.20210087299346924,positive,positive

2024-07-24,Tesla shares close down 12 after earnings miss for biggest slump since 2020 Tesla shares plummeted the most since 2020 after the electric vehicle maker reported weaker than expected quarterly earnings and another drop in automotive revenue. The stock closed down 12 on Wednesday at $215.99. It s now down 13 for the year while the Nasdaq is up 16 over that stretch. Tesla on Tuesday said auto revenue declined 7 from a year earlier to $19.9 billion while margins also fell. Total revenue increased 2 to $25.5 billion. The company has been forced to slash prices globally and offer discounts and incentives as it faces slowing sales and rising competition especially in China. Tesla remains the top seller of electric vehicles in the U.S. by far but is losing market share to a growing number of rivals due in part to its aging lineup of sedans and SUVs and the impact of Musk s incendiary and political commentary. Adjusted earnings of 52 cents a share for the second quarter trailed the average analyst estimate of 62 cents according to LSEG. And Tesla s adjusted operating margin shrank to the lowest in three years dropping to 14.4 from 18.7 a year earlier. It s the fourth straight quarter of shrinkage. Investors have been focused on a number of other areas around the Tesla story including when the company will introduce a new mass market car to reinvigorate its lineup of vehicles. Musk said on the earnings call Tuesday that Tesla is on track to deliver a new affordable car in the first half of next year. Robotaxis were a big topic on the earnings call. Musk envisions a world in which owners can authorize their Tesla vehicle to be used as part of an Uber style ride hailing service with the cars driving autonomously. When asked when he expects the first robotaxi ride Musk said I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year. Musk has a history of promising things on a particular timeline and not delivering. On Tuesday he pushed back the date of the company s robotaxi event to October after previously saying it would take place in August. This is because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle Musk said adding that Tesla is going to show up a couple of other things. He didn t provide details.

2024-07-24,Alphabet to invest $5 billion in self driving car unit Waymo Alphabet is again investing in its self driving car unit Waymo this time with $5 billion. This new round of funding will enable Waymo to continue to build the world s leading autonomous driving company Alphabet s outgoing finance chief Ruth Porat said Tuesday on the company s second quarter earnings call adding Waymo is an important example of Alphabet s long standing investments. Porat announced the multiyear investment on the call and said more information would be available in the company s quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing expected on Wednesday. Alphabet s Other Bets unit which includes Waymo delivered $365 million in quarterly revenue up from $285 million a year ago. But the unit s losses widened to $1.13 billion from $813 million in the year earlier period. CEO Sundar Pichai said on the earnings call that Waymo provides 50 000 weekly paid trips primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix. It has completed 2 million trips to date. In June Waymo removed the waitlist and opened Waymo rides to all San Francisco users. The unit raised $2.25 billion in its first external funding round in 2020. The company raised another $2.5 billion in 2021 in a round that included funding from Andreessen Horowitz AutoNation Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Fidelity Management Research Company and more. Alphabet s increased investment in Waymo comes after General Motors autonomous vehicle unit Cruise said it would indefinitely delay the production of the Origin a self driving shuttle designed for use in cities. Tesla on Tuesday delayed plans to unveil its CyberCab a dedicated robotaxi from August to Oct. 10. Alphabet has committed up to $5B to Waymo Waymo CEO Tekedra Mawakana said on X. We are grateful for their immense vote of confidence in our team and recognizing the amazing progress we ve made with our technology product and commercialization efforts.

2024-07-25,The Increasing Importance of Copper in Modern Industries The push for electric vehicles and renewable energy infrastructure significantly boosts copper demand. Copper prices have risen approximately 6.54 since the beginning of 2024. Analysts predict copper prices could reach $11 000 per metric ton by the end of 2024 driven by increased demand and potential supply constraints. The stock market is facing uncertainty with turbulent days ahead. Tesla s recent missed earnings demonstrate how even major players can experience corrections and return to more expected levels. Some experts suggest that the market may be undergoing a shift. While the exchanges might be fluctuating it could be wise to take a cautious approach and consider safer investments. However this doesn t mean you should only invest in assets with low potential growth. You might consider exploring small cap but promising companies as well as mining exploration firms with significant potential. These investments could offer opportunities for growth while still managing risk. What Commodity Should You Look After While gold is here and represents one of the safest commodities in the world another one is emerging as a top asset. It is not silver but copper. Why Copper is essential for the modern world playing a crucial role in various industries due to its excellent electrical conductivity and thermal properties. Copper is a critical component in the production of electrical wiring electronics and renewable energy systems including solar panels and wind turbines. As the world transitions to greener energy sources the demand for copper is expected to soar. The push for electric vehicles is another major driver as each EV requires significantly more copper than a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle. Additionally the expansion of 5G networks and increasing urbanization are set to further boost copper demand. Copper has experienced a notable price increase over the past six months gaining approximately 6.54 since the beginning of 2024. This rise is attributed to growing demand from sectors like electric vehicles renewable energy infrastructure and general electronics all of which heavily rely on copper due to its superior electrical conductivity and thermal properties . Looking ahead the outlook for copper remains optimistic. Analysts predict that copper prices could continue to climb potentially reaching $11 000 per metric ton by the end of 2024. This anticipated growth is driven by an expected increase in global demand particularly from green energy initiatives and infrastructure projects. Additionally potential supply constraints from major copper producing regions like Chile and Peru could further tighten the market supporting higher prices . Introducing World Copper World Copper Ltd. headquartered in Vancouver BC is a Canadian resource company specializing in the exploration and development of significant copper porphyry projects. The company s primary assets include the Zonia project in Arizona and the Escalones project in Chile. World Copper also aims to capitalize on these assets by continuing to explore and expand the known mineralization leveraging its experienced team and strategic positioning in copper rich regions. The company is also exploring additional opportunities in the U.S. aligning with governmental initiatives recognizing copper as a critical metal further enhancing its portfolio s growth potential . Zonia Copper Project The Zonia Copper Project located in Arizona is a significant venture managed by World Copper Ltd. This project includes a historically productive open pit copper mine with a substantial resource estimate that underscores its economic potential. The region s rich mineral deposits make the site an important focus for further exploration and development efforts. Recent Developments World Copper recently announced a new discovery within the Zonia Copper Project highlighting the potential for expanded copper resources. The Mountain States Research Development provided key data on the site revealing 14 million tons of historically mined material available for re processing split into 7.1 million tons of run of mine mineralized material on three historical heap leach pads. 7.7 million tons of blasted and leveled in situ leach mineralized material. For the material on the heap leach pads The original copper grade before leaching was estimated between 0.4 and 0.6 CuT . This material yielded 30.5 million pounds of copper during operations from March 1966 to March 1975. An estimated 26.7 to 55.1 million pounds of copper may remain unrecovered. For the ISL area The original copper grades were estimated between 0.269 and 0.292 CuT. This area produced 2.70 million pounds of copper between mid 1972 and March 1975. It is estimated that 38.6 to 41.8 million pounds of copper may remain. The total potential unrecovered copper from both the heap leach pads and the ISL area is estimated to be between 65 million to 96 million pounds . Based on these findings World Copper s Technical Advisory Committee is considering re processing the material to recover the remaining copper. Escalones Copper Project The Escalones Copper Project managed by World Copper Ltd. is situated in Chile approximately 35 kilometers east of El Teniente one of the world s largest underground copper mines. The project is a high potential copper gold porphyry system encompassing a large area with significant mineralization. It has been a key focus for World Copper Ltd. due to its extensive resource potential and strategic location within a well known mining district. Key Details of the Escalones Project Location 35 km east of El Teniente Chile. Project Type Copper gold porphyry system. Key Resource Estimates and Potential Measured Indicated Resources 426 million tonnes at 0.367 CuT . This includes 3.45 billion pounds of copper. Inferred Resources 178 million tonnes at 0.356 CuT. This includes an additional 1.4 billion pounds of copper. High grade Core Contains 104 million tonnes at 0.79 CuT indicating a rich copper deposit within the larger resource area. The project s strategic development plan involves further exploration and resource expansion with a focus on defining high grade zones and enhancing the overall resource base. The Escalones Project represents a significant asset for World Copper Ltd. providing potential for long term copper production. Conclusion Copper s essential role in modern technologies particularly in the shift towards renewable energy and electric vehicles makes it a critical commodity. The rising demand coupled with potential supply constraints suggests a strong market outlook for copper. Companies like World Copper are well positioned to capitalize on this growing demand with significant projects like Zonia and Escalones poised for development and expansion.,reddit,0.9991,0.152,0.037,0.811,0.7203660607337952,0.01915290579199791,0.2604810893535614,positive,positive

2024-07-25,Will IBM Save the Confidence In AI I think that the recent pullback in the stock is a hedge against AI not having a financial impact yet as neither Tesla nor Alphabet has increased their business using AI yet . But IBM was able to satisfy investors AND more importantly is said part of its success was AI. Given the short memory I attribute to investors I think that they will be happy to revert their hedges today or at least pause it until Microsoft s report next week. Unlike Alphabet Code Pilot is a very popular tool so I expect Microsoft to please investors and give them lollipops and confidence in AI as a money printer. This assumes that the latest so called correction is indeed a hedge and not a rotation and that Microsoft is going to deliver. And of course I hope that no weird political events will bless us in the following week.,reddit,0.9919,0.227,0.007,0.766,0.3127523362636566,0.021113896742463112,0.6661337614059448,positive,neutral

Vehicle deliveries declining. Their market is getting eaten away by competitors and they have no strategy to combat that. Reliability is mid tier. Their R D projects are missing schedules for a while and has no substance. Even though there aren t much positive indicators around the stock for a while now why do they have such a high P E ratio What is the justification A typical response may be because Elon is a good liar or some anti Elon emotional take but I refuse to believe that such a superficial factor can support such a high P E ratio. The average P E ratio of other top car manufacturers is around 18. I can believe it if the Elon factor pushes it up to around 30 but 60 is just ridiculous. What are the investors and traders looking at Am I missing something Or is this a purely speculative bubble and are we in for a royal shitstorm when it pops,reddit,-0.6966,0.063,0.1,0.837,0.009892627596855164,0.9570367336273193,0.03307054191827774,negative,negative

2024-07-26,Tech stocks fall in US and Asia as AI shares decline The US and Asian stock markets have dropped sharply as buyers sell off their shares in tech companies. Stocks in artificial intelligence companies have been hit the hardest. Both the S P 500 and the tech heavy Nasdaq fell the most in one day since 2022. This happened in New York on Wednesday. It went down by 1.2 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Companies like Nvidia Apple Google Tesla Microsoft and Alphabet were the ones that lost the most money. The Nikkei average in Japan fell more than 3 on Thursday the most in all of Asia. Most of this year s stock market gains have come from shares in tech companies especially those that work with AI. One of the biggest winners in the AI boom has been Nvidia a company whose shares fell 6.8 . This item has lost around 15 of its value in the past two weeks. Chipmakers Renesas Electronics and Tokyo Electron as well as SK Hynix in South Korea were some of the worst hit in Asia. There were also big surprises in the US presidential race and in when the US central bank cut interest rates which has made investors wary.

2024-07-26,Short seller Andrew Left of Citron charged with fraud by prosecutors SEC Excerpts Federal prosecutors have criminally charged the activist short seller and analyst Andrew Leftwith securities fraud related to allegedly using his public platform to illegally profit to the tune of at least $16 million from manipulating stock market activity contrary to positions he presented to the public from 2018 through 2023. Left bragged to colleagues that some of these statements were especially effective at inducing retail investors to trade based on his recommendations and said that it was like taking candy from a baby the SEC alleged in that complaint. The companies identified in the as ones Left allegedly traded on in ways contrary to his public stances on their stock prices included the social media company X formerly known as Twitter XL Fleet Namaste Technologies and India Globalization Capital. In exchange for sharing his planned announcements with the hedge funds in advance of posting them publicly the hedge funds paid defendant Left a portion of their trading profits the indictment says. By using the Citron Twitter Account to generate catalysts events with the ability to move stock prices defendant Left profited from his advance knowledge that he was about to trigger such movements in the market. After using his influence to manipulate a stock s price Left closed his positions to capitalize on the temporary price movement caused by his public statements the indictment alleges. If convicted he would face a maximum possible sentence of 25 years in prison for the securities fraud scheme alone.,reddit,-0.2975,0.086,0.087,0.828,0.029518062248826027,0.45978018641471863,0.5107017159461975,negative,neutral

2024-08-01,The Increasing Importance of Copper in Modern Industries The push for electric vehicles and renewable energy infrastructure significantly boosts copper demand. Copper prices have risen approximately 6.54 since the beginning of 2024. Analysts predict copper prices could reach $11 000 per metric ton by the end of 2024 driven by increased demand and potential supply constraints. The stock market is facing uncertainty with turbulent days ahead. Tesla s recent missed earnings demonstrate how even major players can experience corrections and return to more expected levels. Some experts suggest that the market may be undergoing a shift. While the exchanges might be fluctuating it could be wise to take a cautious approach and consider safer investments. However this doesn t mean you should only invest in assets with low potential growth. You might consider exploring small cap but promising companies as well as mining exploration firms with significant potential. These investments could offer opportunities for growth while still managing risk. What Commodity Should You Look After While gold is here and represents one of the safest commodities in the world another one is emerging as a top asset. It is not silver but copper. Why Copper is essential for the modern world playing a crucial role in various industries due to its excellent electrical conductivity and thermal properties. Copper is a critical component in the production of electrical wiring electronics and renewable energy systems including solar panels and wind turbines. As the world transitions to greener energy sources the demand for copper is expected to soar. The push for electric vehicles is another major driver as each EV requires significantly more copper than a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle. Additionally the expansion of 5G networks and increasing urbanization are set to further boost copper demand. Copper has experienced a notable price increase over the past six months gaining approximately 6.54 since the beginning of 2024. This rise is attributed to growing demand from sectors like electric vehicles renewable energy infrastructure and general electronics all of which heavily rely on copper due to its superior electrical conductivity and thermal properties . Looking ahead the outlook for copper remains optimistic. Analysts predict that copper prices could continue to climb potentially reaching $11 000 per metric ton by the end of 2024. This anticipated growth is driven by an expected increase in global demand particularly from green energy initiatives and infrastructure projects. Additionally potential supply constraints from major copper producing regions like Chile and Peru could further tighten the market supporting higher prices . Introducing World Copper World Copper Ltd. headquartered in Vancouver BC is a Canadian resource company specializing in the exploration and development of significant copper porphyry projects. The company s primary assets include the Zonia project in Arizona and the Escalones project in Chile. World Copper also aims to capitalize on these assets by continuing to explore and expand the known mineralization leveraging its experienced team and strategic positioning in copper rich regions. The company is also exploring additional opportunities in the U.S. aligning with governmental initiatives recognizing copper as a critical metal further enhancing its portfolio s growth potential . Zonia Copper Project The Zonia Copper Project located in Arizona is a significant venture managed by World Copper Ltd. This project includes a historically productive open pit copper mine with a substantial resource estimate that underscores its economic potential. The region s rich mineral deposits make the site an important focus for further exploration and development efforts. Recent Developments World Copper recently announced a new discovery within the Zonia Copper Project highlighting the potential for expanded copper resources. The Mountain States Research Development provided key data on the site revealing 14 million tons of historically mined material available for re processing split into 7.1 million tons of run of mine mineralized material on three historical heap leach pads. 7.7 million tons of blasted and leveled in situ leach mineralized material. For the material on the heap leach pads The original copper grade before leaching was estimated between 0.4 and 0.6 CuT. This material yielded 30.5 million pounds of copper during operations from March 1966 to March 1975. An estimated 26.7 to 55.1 million pounds of copper may remain unrecovered. For the ISL area The original copper grades were estimated between 0.269 and 0.292 CuT. This area produced 2.70 million pounds of copper between mid 1972 and March 1975. It is estimated that 38.6 to 41.8 million pounds of copper may remain. The total potential unrecovered copper from both the heap leach pads and the ISL area is estimated to be between 65 million to 96 million pounds. Based on these findings World Copper s Technical Advisory Committee is considering re processing the material to recover the remaining copper. Escalones Copper Project The Escalones Copper Project managed by World Copper Ltd. is situated in Chile approximately 35 kilometers east of El Teniente one of the world s largest underground copper mines. The project is a high potential copper gold porphyry system encompassing a large area with significant mineralization. It has been a key focus for World Copper Ltd. due to its extensive resource potential and strategic location within a well known mining district. Key Details of the Escalones Project Location 35 km east of El Teniente Chile. Project Type Copper gold porphyry system. Key Resource Estimates and Potential Measured Indicated Resources 426 million tonnes at 0.367 CuT . This includes 3.45 billion pounds of copper. Inferred Resources 178 million tonnes at 0.356 CuT. This includes an additional 1.4 billion pounds of copper. High grade Core Contains 104 million tonnes at 0.79 CuT indicating a rich copper deposit within the larger resource area. The project s strategic development plan involves further exploration and resource expansion with a focus on defining high grade zones and enhancing the overall resource base. The Escalones Project represents a significant asset for World Copper Ltd. providing potential for long term copper production. Conclusion Copper s essential role in modern technologies particularly in the shift towards renewable energy and electric vehicles makes it a critical commodity. The rising demand coupled with potential supply constraints suggests a strong market outlook for copper. Companies like World Copper are well positioned to capitalize on this growing demand with significant projects like Zonia and Escalones poised for development and expansion.,reddit,0.9991,0.152,0.037,0.811,0.7203660607337952,0.01915290579199791,0.2604810893535614,positive,positive

2024-08-01,Analyzing the Analysts Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S P Hello everyone I m a lazy investor and don t like to do much due diligence but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I ve lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it s price action and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you ll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy I have a thesis that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I m an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I m stupid for following their lead but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates there is still much I don t know as I don t have a finance or economics degree. Moreover as bad as you may think an analyst is they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly and most importantly what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I m not relying on a single analyst but several . I think if two dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had and how many of them were Strong Buys and Buys . This yielded the following table A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings Strong Buy Ratings Buy Ratings of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87 38 11 21 28.95 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01 34 14 13 41.18 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10 38 14 15 36.84 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58 47 15 28 31.91 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90 63 21 34 33.33 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37 5 0 3 0.00 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33 6 1 3 16.67 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44 22 9 8 40.91 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96 29 10 17 34.48 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05 28 9 13 32.14 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73 23 0 0 0.00 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15 22 11 11 50.00 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55 25 5 11 20.00 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12 39 13 22 33.33 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57 23 4 8 17.39 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54 22 6 4 27.27 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65 39 14 20 35.90 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42 33 12 12 36.36 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69 29 7 11 24.14 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51 32 8 7 25.00 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61 21 4 7 19.05 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09 30 6 16 20.00 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61 24 6 10 25.00 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11 41 11 14 26.83 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99 25 5 7 20.00 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39 45 16 25 35.56 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36 31 11 14 35.48 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38 22 10 10 45.45 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45 15 8 6 53.33 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33 31 0.00 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41 0 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59 36 10 16 27.78 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23 31 4 8 12.90 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00 29 7 9 24.14 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83 27 8 11 29.63 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00 33 8 15 24.24 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62 23 2 7 8.70 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99 17 5 29.41 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18 20 7 6 35.00 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88 32 6 8 18.75 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53 17 7 6 41.18 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82 25 3 7 12.00 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00 22 6 3 27.27 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50 18 2 7 11.11 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95 22 2 11 9.09 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33 25 4 4 16.00 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10 30 5 10 16.67 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86 32 2 6 6.25 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54 24 4 7 16.67 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90 34 13 17 38.24 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29 21 4 15 19.05 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80 27 4 7 14.81 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02 31 12 18 38.71 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97 15 1 9 6.67 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05 0 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22 17 6 5 35.29 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21 15 5 8 33.33 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91 29 5 7 17.24 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91 28 6 4 21.43 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82 32 8 10 25.00 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74 30 6 3 20.00 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21 20 7 9 35.00 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63 0 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44 27 10 12 37.04 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70 27 3 14 11.11 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59 27 9 14 33.33 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85 41 18 0.00 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61 0 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17 19 5 4 26.32 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37 29 5 12 17.24 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80 0 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56 15 3 9 20.00 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90 18 4 8 22.22 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23 22 7 31.82 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13 24 3 4 12.50 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72 26 7 6 26.92 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97 31 8 20 25.81 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22 19 5 11 26.32 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44 27 11 6 40.74 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44 26 6 10 23.08 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43 19 3 12 15.79 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59 19 4 7 21.05 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37 24 10 8 41.67 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90 23 4 7 17.39 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89 25 7 7 28.00 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23 18 1 1 5.56 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66 22 7 14 31.82 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55 41 13 16 31.71 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82 14 2 4 14.29 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93 14 6 6 42.86 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66 17 6 7 35.29 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23 22 5 4 22.73 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88 28 2 11 7.14 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23 19 5 9 26.32 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94 22 4 3 18.18 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34 19 1 2 5.26 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15 26 3 2 11.54 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04 17 1 4 5.88 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08 30 7 16 23.33 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58 21 6 9 28.57 Based on this table above I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25 of their analyst ratings be Strong Buys to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90 or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies Micron Technologies Boston Scientific Abbot Laboratories Merck Scientific Stryker The Cigna Group Broadcom Comcast Honeywell International Analogue Devices and Intuit Inc. I have about $5 000 I d like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I ll either do that or put it all in VOO but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S P 500 over the next 24 months.

2024-08-01,Analyzing the Analysts Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S P Hello everyone I m a lazy investor and don t like to do much due diligence but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I ve lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it s price action and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you ll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy I have a thesis that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I m an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I m stupid for following their lead but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates there is still much I don t know as I don t have a finance or economics degree. Moreover as bad as you may think an analyst is they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly and most importantly what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I m not relying on a single analyst but several . I think if two dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had and how many of them were Strong Buys and Buys . This yielded the following table A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings Strong Buy Ratings Buy Ratings of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87 38 11 21 28.95 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01 34 14 13 41.18 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10 38 14 15 36.84 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58 47 15 28 31.91 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90 63 21 34 33.33 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37 5 0 3 0.00 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33 6 1 3 16.67 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44 22 9 8 40.91 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96 29 10 17 34.48 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05 28 9 13 32.14 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73 23 0 0 0.00 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15 22 11 11 50.00 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55 25 5 11 20.00 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12 39 13 22 33.33 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57 23 4 8 17.39 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54 22 6 4 27.27 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65 39 14 20 35.90 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42 33 12 12 36.36 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69 29 7 11 24.14 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51 32 8 7 25.00 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61 21 4 7 19.05 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09 30 6 16 20.00 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61 24 6 10 25.00 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11 41 11 14 26.83 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99 25 5 7 20.00 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39 45 16 25 35.56 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36 31 11 14 35.48 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38 22 10 10 45.45 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45 15 8 6 53.33 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33 31 0.00 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41 0 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59 36 10 16 27.78 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23 31 4 8 12.90 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00 29 7 9 24.14 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83 27 8 11 29.63 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00 33 8 15 24.24 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62 23 2 7 8.70 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99 17 5 29.41 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18 20 7 6 35.00 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88 32 6 8 18.75 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53 17 7 6 41.18 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82 25 3 7 12.00 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00 22 6 3 27.27 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50 18 2 7 11.11 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95 22 2 11 9.09 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33 25 4 4 16.00 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10 30 5 10 16.67 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86 32 2 6 6.25 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54 24 4 7 16.67 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90 34 13 17 38.24 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29 21 4 15 19.05 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80 27 4 7 14.81 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02 31 12 18 38.71 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97 15 1 9 6.67 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05 0 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22 17 6 5 35.29 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21 15 5 8 33.33 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91 29 5 7 17.24 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91 28 6 4 21.43 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82 32 8 10 25.00 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74 30 6 3 20.00 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21 20 7 9 35.00 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63 0 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44 27 10 12 37.04 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70 27 3 14 11.11 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59 27 9 14 33.33 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85 41 18 0.00 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61 0 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17 19 5 4 26.32 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37 29 5 12 17.24 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80 0 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56 15 3 9 20.00 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90 18 4 8 22.22 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23 22 7 31.82 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13 24 3 4 12.50 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72 26 7 6 26.92 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97 31 8 20 25.81 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22 19 5 11 26.32 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44 27 11 6 40.74 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44 26 6 10 23.08 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43 19 3 12 15.79 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59 19 4 7 21.05 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37 24 10 8 41.67 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90 23 4 7 17.39 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89 25 7 7 28.00 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23 18 1 1 5.56 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66 22 7 14 31.82 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55 41 13 16 31.71 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82 14 2 4 14.29 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93 14 6 6 42.86 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66 17 6 7 35.29 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23 22 5 4 22.73 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88 28 2 11 7.14 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23 19 5 9 26.32 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94 22 4 3 18.18 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34 19 1 2 5.26 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15 26 3 2 11.54 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04 17 1 4 5.88 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08 30 7 16 23.33 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58 21 6 9 28.57 Based on this table above I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25 of their analyst ratings be Strong Buys to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90 or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies Micron Technologies Boston Scientific Abbot Laboratories Merck Scientific Stryker The Cigna Group Broadcom Comcast Honeywell International Analogue Devices and Intuit Inc. I have about $5 000 I d like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I ll either do that or put it all in VOO but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S P 500 over the next 24 months.

2024-08-01,Analyzing the Analysts Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S P Hello everyone I m a lazy investor and don t like to do much due diligence but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I ve lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it s price action and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you ll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy I have a thesis that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I m an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I m stupid for following their lead but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates there is still much I don t know as I don t have a finance or economics degree. Moreover as bad as you may think an analyst is they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly and most importantly what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I m not relying on a single analyst but several . I think if two dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had and how many of them were Strong Buys and Buys .

I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25 of their analyst ratings be Strong Buys to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90 or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies Micron Technologies Boston Scientific Abbot Laboratories Merck Scientific Stryker The Cigna Group Broadcom Comcast Honeywell International Analogue Devices and Intuit Inc. I have about $5 000 I d like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I ll either do that or put it all in VOO but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S P 500 over the next 24 months.

2024-08-02,22 yo investing for roughly three years having regrets about my choices. Hello stockers. I was doing some reflecting looking at my portfolio that I have slowly been building since July Aug of 2021. I have mostly been doing stock picking based on companies I liked and unfortunately I have come to the realization that I have missed out on quite a bit of gains from not simply investing in VOO or SPY. My total return on three years of investing is 25 but had I just put my money in VOO in a dollar cost averaging method I would likely have a much higher return. Any advice for me Should I just sell things off and put them in VOO My current portfolio breakdown looks like this. Of course some bigger losers I have sold off. $7934 invested $9950 current.

2024-08-03,Negative sentiment around the car industry The car industry is a notoriously difficult one to invest in. Highly cyclical very competitive and very very capital intensive. Right now consumer sentiment seems at the lowest point in the decade. Everytime I lookat a new car model people complain that the company has lost its way their new cars sucks are too expemsive and people brag about their 15 years old car with 200 miles on it. I am not a car enthusiast but I understand that higher prices and interest rates take a toll on people. But I think at the end they will have to comply with the new industry standards and the brands still a bit od differentiation allowing companies to charge some margins . This is good news for many legacy cars companies. People have to change cars at some point and the competition isn t doing great either. Even if there is a risk of a price war I think it s not too great and many company will retain their margins in the long run. I am sitting on the sidelines for now but if prices keep falling I might start building a position. Some may consider EVs as the Levant in the room. But at least with Tesla EV sales are struggling as much as ICE ones or more. As for China I think tarrifs will do a great job at hurting consumers and protecting western automakers. Do you think the industry will recover from this downturn and go back to 2021 2022 level of profitability or do is it going to experience a prolonged crisis,reddit,-0.9085,0.075,0.127,0.799,0.0235462449491024,0.8867597579956055,0.08969394117593765,negative,negative

2024-08-06,What s the deal with German automakers being so undervalued German car companies like Mercedes BMW Porsche being valued at under 50 billion with P E of around 5 seems massively illogical. Musk paid 44 billion for Twitter. Porsche s market cap is 30 billion. You could not even buy all the Porsches that are produced in a single year for 30 billion let alone come anywhere close to buying the company. So how does it make sense that in theory owning 51 of the shares which equals only about 15 billion worth right now makes you the owner of the Porsche company Of course this is in theory because you cannot just go and buy 51 of the shares but you get the point. As reference Intel currently is still valued 4 times as much as Porsche and twice as much as Mercedes while basically being a company on lifeline supported by tax money while Mercedes released the first approved level 3 self driving car so these companies aren t just sleeping on new tech and living off of past glory like Intel to be valued only around or under the 50 billion mark. But that s how they are valued.,reddit,0.9849,0.154,0.007,0.84,0.03486098721623421,0.04781142622232437,0.9173276424407959,positive,neutral

2024-08-06,3 Fund Portfolio Bond Advice I m 44 years old and have about $5M in my Schwab accounts. Around $1M is in SNAXX money market taking advantage of the high interest rates and the rest is in stocks and mutual funds. My largest holdings are in AAPL and TSLA accounting for about $3M. I spoke with my adviser at Schwab today because I m ready to redirect my monthly SIMPLE IRA contributions from buying stocks to something else. He suggested the Schwab Intelligent Portfolio which seems like a good fit. I ve also been reading about the 3 fund portfolio. So with all that in mind I have a few questions 1. Feedback on SIP vs. 3 fund portfolio If I go with the 3 fund portfolio should I stick with the Schwab options listed on the Bogleheads wiki or is there a better way to choose the funds 2. Advice on moving $500K from SNAXX to bonds I m ready to move half of the $1M in SNAXX to bonds in preparation for interest rates coming down so I can lock in some good returns for the next 5 years. Any recommendations on what I should consider buying I ve done well so far by just buying stocks but this is a bit out of my expertise so I would love some guidance.

2024-08-06,Possible Bullish Thesis on Hertz I know I know investors or traders have gotten the shaft on this ticker but hear me out. Hertz ran into more issues post covid travel restrictions when Tesla marked down the price of their vehicles and accelerated the depreciation of said assets on their books . There has also been seasonality regarding sales profitability and consumer spending is relatively contractionary for the overall sector. Their earnings have obviously been unsatisfactory and there s been leadership and financial restructuring to try get things back on track. IDC about any of that really what I care about is the strategic mistake to accelerate the sale of their EVs given the low utilization rate of EVs by their customers in the Hertz fleet. Hertz is positioned to have one of the largest robo taxi fleets in the world second to only Tesla themselves to my knowledge and Tesla can t position fleets everywhere yet . After Tesla began seriously teasing investors with the idea companies like Lyft and Uber corrected hard while Hertz reached a bottom $3 share with upside volatility characteristics. Hertz is trading at well below book value and the PP E depreciation will decelerate once Teslas become a profitable investment . The low utilization rate by Hertz s customers will be moot if the fleet is automatically participating robo ridesharing. They will be utilized at least more so than previous reporting periods. If Hertz slows or ceases selling their EVs for short term liquidity once robo taxi platform rolls out Hertz has a new revenue stream with their existing assets. The depreciation will slow or reverse their low utilization rate will subside and their profitability will increase dramatically. There s a lot of ifs in this scenario but if this happens I think Hertz will at least trade at book value indicating over 75 upside by the end of this year. If profitability continued to grow from robo taxi fees and if Hertz accomplishes higher profitability over the next several years from this while increasing utilization rates their EPS will go profitable again which if sustainable we re looking at over $10 20 share in the coming years. What are your thoughts Do you see value in this thesis Do you have a strong counter argument Looking forward to your thoughts.

2024-08-06,Uber reports better than expected earnings and revenue for second quarter Uber on Tuesday reported second quarter earnings results that topped Wall Street estimates. The stock rose about 6 at the market open. Here s how the company did for the period ending June 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG Earnings per share 47 cents vs. 31 cents expected Revenue $10.7 billion vs. $10.57 billion expected Revenue increased 16 from $9.23 billion a year earlier Uber said in a press release. The company s mobility unit reported a 23 increase in gross bookings to $20.6 billion. Gross bookings rose 16 in delivery to $18.1 billion and were flat in the freight unit at $1.27 billion. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi had said the company expected around 20 growth for the second quarter based on anticipated continued expansion in its core mobility business and rising frequency of orders for food and trips through its membership subscribers. For the third quarter Uber expects bookings of $40.25 billion to $41.75 billion. The middle of the range $41 billion fell shy of the $41.18 billion average estimate according to StreetAccount. The company expects adjusted earnings of $1.58 billion to $1.68 billion with the middle of the range just above the $1.62 billion average estimate. Uber s monthly active platform consumers or MAPCs reached 156 million in the second quarter with 2.77 billion trips via the Uber platform. This compares with 137 million MAPCs and 2.28 billion trips during the same period a year ago. Uber also reported $1.02 billion in net income for the quarter which included a $333 million pretax benefit from revaluations of Uber s equity investments. In May the company announced a partnership with Instacart that would add a restaurants tab to the grocery delivery app enabling its users to order from restaurants and have deliveries fulfilled by Uber Eats. In July Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD and Uber announced a partnership to bring around 100 000 EVs to Uber drivers starting in Europe and Latin America. The companies also plan to collaborate on future BYD autonomous capable vehicles to be deployed on the Uber platform Uber said Tuesday. While BYD vehicles aren t sold or available for lease in the U.S. Uber has a range of other incentives and options in place to motivate drivers to use Tesla and other battery electric vehicles rather than gas powered cars. Analysts on the earnings call asked Khosrowshahi about Uber s experience with autonomous vehicles including its partnerships and long term strategy for the market. Uber and Waymo partner in Arizona to let Uber users book driverless rides and food deliveries as an option. Khosrowshahi didn t disclose specifics about Waymo but said broadly AV players experience much higher utilization with Uber than they do without a network on a first party basis. He said Uber will continue to have the most liquid and largest marketplace and that there will be a pretty long hybrid period as autonomous is developing and regulators are trying to figure out exactly how to regulate it. We don t think this will be a winner take all market Khosrowshahi said. Uber shares were down 5 for the year as of Monday s close but are now up slightly after Tuesday s rally.

I want to get to a place where I can invest $250 EVERY MONTH not just 3 or 7 months the year but 12 months. I want investing to be apart of my monthly budget and I m serious about that expense just like I am my rent car note. 3. NO STRUCTURE there s no portfolio management I don t have a solid investment strategy. So in a nut shell I m investing all wrong. I m proud of my self for taking the steps to invest because majority of my blood line doesn t invest but I am one of the ones that isn t scared I want to seek out the necessary information and I want to apply it. So that being me to my questions. how do I find a solid investment advisor CFA what exactly do I look for I m sure there s some bullshit advisors out there and I want to make SURE I don t run into one. My generational wealth depends on the quality of my advisor. I m just not sure how to do due diligence to even find the right person. This is way out of my arena. If anyone can offer advice insight recommendations it would be much Appreciated. This topic stresses me out so much because what if I really pick a sh tty advisor and I don t reap the benefits I want in my retirement.

2024-08-07,Elon Musk s support for Trump pushes a corporate customer away from Tesla European drugstore giant Rossmann announced Tuesday it will no longer buy Tesla s electric vehicles for its fleet effective immediately citing CEO Elon Musk s pro Trump political support. Rossmann based in Germany said in a statement that its decision was based on the incompatibility between the statements of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the values that Tesla represents with its products. Elon Musk makes no secret of his support for Donald Trump Raoul Rossmann a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. Trump has repeatedly described climate change as a hoax this attitude is in stark contrast to Tesla s mission to contribute to environmental protection through the production of electric cars. While Rossmann only purchases about 180 electric vehicles a year and only had 38 Teslas in its fleet according to Bloomberg the company s decision to cut all Tesla EV purchases shows that Musk s political decisions have begun to impact the automaker well beyond the U.S. Musk formally endorsed Trump last month and said he was contributing funds to a pro Trump group he helped create called America PAC. Musk is also slated to interview the former president Trump announced on Tuesday. During a debate with President Biden in June former President Trump dodged questions about what he would do if anything to combat climate change. And Trump has called climate change a hoax. He has also promised to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate agreement as he did during his presidency if he is re elected in November. According to ongoing research by Morning Consult Republicans in the U.S. began to view Musk more favorably following his leveraged buyout of Twitter in late 2022. However this has not driven an increase in Republican s purchasing consideration of electric vehicles here. According to Pew Research Musk s reputation with left leaning voters has declined even though they are far more likely to purchase an EV. Rossman s decision follows a recent survey that found a deterioration in Tesla s brand attributed partly to Musk s antics and political rants. While Tesla s revenue increased 2 during the second quarter automotive revenue dropped 7 to $19.9 billion from $21.27 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Tesla opened a factory in 2022 in Brandenburg Germany and employs thousands in the country. At the end of 2023 the drugstore chain Rossmann reported that it had more than 4 700 stores and more than 60 000 employees with about half in Germany. Tesla has faced protests by environmental activists in Germany who took issue with the company s plans to cut down part of a forest and to use water for manufacturing in Brandenburg. Musk lashed out at protesters there saying on X in March they re either the dumbest eco terrorists on Earth or they re puppets of those who don t have good environmental goals. Tesla Musk and representatives for Rossmann did not respond to requests for further details on Thursday morning.

2024-08-08,Possible Bullish Thesis on Hertz I know I know investors or traders have gotten the shaft on this ticker but hear me out. Hertz ran into more issues post covid travel restrictions when Tesla marked down the price of their vehicles and accelerated the depreciation of said assets on Hertz s books . There has also been seasonality regarding sales profitability and consumer spending is relatively contractionary for the overall sector. Their earnings have obviously been unsatisfactory and there s been leadership and financial restructuring to try get things back on track. IDC about any of that really what I care about is the strategic mistake to accelerate the sale of their EVs given the low utilization rate of EVs by their customers in the Hertz fleet. Hertz is positioned to have one of the largest robo taxi fleets in the world second to only Tesla themselves to my knowledge and Tesla can t position fleets everywhere yet . After Tesla began seriously teasing investors with the idea companies like Lyft and Uber corrected hard while Hertz reached a bottom $3 share with upside volatility characteristics. Hertz is trading at well below book value and the PP E depreciation will decelerate once Teslas become a profitable investment . The low utilization rate by Hertz s customers will be moot if the fleet is automatically participating robo ridesharing. They will be utilized at least more so than previous reporting periods. If Hertz slows or ceases selling their EVs for short term liquidity once robo taxi platform rolls out Hertz has a new revenue stream with their existing assets. The depreciation will slow or reverse their low utilization rate will subside and their profitability will increase dramatically. There s a lot of ifs in this scenario but if this happens I think Hertz will at least trade at book value indicating over 75 upside by the end of this year. If profitability continued to grow from robo taxi fees and if Hertz accomplishes higher profitability over the next several years from this while increasing utilization rates their EPS will go profitable again which if sustainable we re looking at over $10 20 share in the coming years. What are your thoughts Do you see value in this thesis Do you have a strong counter argument Looking forward to your thoughts.

Upcoming Models Polestar isn t resting on its laurels. They ve got several new models in the pipeline Polestar 3 An electric SUV designed to compete with the likes of the Tesla Model X and Audi e tron Porsche Macan EV Mercedes Benz EQE SUV BMW iX. This segment is hot and Polestar 3 s premium build and cutting edge tech could make it a hit. Plus production is set for their South Carolina factory to avoid European and US tariffs.

2024-08-12,Tesla Stops Taking Orders For Its Least Expensive Cybertruck Cheapest Cybertruck Now Costs $99 990 Tesla has quietly stopped taking orders on its entry level Cybertruck which was originally priced at $61 000 leaving the $100 000 version as the new starting point for potential buyers. This move is a significant shift from the initial promises made by CEO Elon Musk who in 2019 projected that the Cybertruck would cost around $40 000 and deliver over 500 miles on a single charge. Now the least expensive model available is the dual motor Foundation series which is priced at $99 990 and offers a 318 mile range. This model is available for delivery as soon as this month while the higher end $119 990 tri motor Cyberbeast which has a 301 mile range is expected to be delivered starting in October. Despite Musk s earlier claims of having over 1 million reservations some analysts believe that interest in the truck may not be as strong as initially expected especially for the higher priced models. Sam Abuelsamid an analyst at Guidehouse Insights noted that this latest move shows that demand is a lot less than a million trucks particularly for those who were holding out for a more affordable option. Tesla s shift to prioritize its more expensive models is a clear signal that the company is focusing on maximizing profitability even if it means pricing out a significant portion of its potential customer base. The Cybertruck with its unconventional trapezoidal design inspired by the Blade Runner movie and its stainless steel body has certainly captured the imagination of many but the reality of its pricing and range limitations may dampen enthusiasm for some. Sales figures show that Tesla sold nearly 4 800 Cybertrucks in July marking its best month yet and making it the best selling vehicle in the U.S. priced over $100 000. However maintaining this level of sales at such high price points could prove to be a challenge. A spokesperson for Cox Automotive commented that while Tesla has sold more than 16 000 units so far sustained high volume at that price point will be a challenge reflecting the potential difficulty Tesla may face in maintaining strong sales numbers without a more affordable option in the lineup. The Cybertruck s journey to market has been fraught with delays and challenges with deliveries only beginning in November 2023 after years of setbacks and a difficult production ramp up. With the latest pricing strategy Tesla seems to be betting on the allure of its high end models to carry the day but whether this gamble will pay off remains to be seen.

2024-08-21,Next Steps with Rebalance and Growth I posted a couple weeks ago seeking some advice on a 3 fund portfolio and bonds Got lots of great feedback and now that I have digested it all I m looking to move on some of it and hoping for some followup great advice on how to best handle. The gist of it was $5M portfolio heavily weighted in AAPL and TSLA with $1M cash. Commenters suggest diversifying into index funds or bond funds considering the tax implications of selling stocks and caution against over reliance on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios due to its high cash allocation. Some recommend exploring municipal bonds for tax efficiency and using a more conservative investment strategy given my financial situation. What I ve started the process of doing is moving some of the cash to VOO VXUS and VXF at a 50 25 25 split. I feel confident with that mix and my goal of turning this $5M into $10M in 10 years seems possible. That just leaves the stocks and figuring out how to best convert those over into the 3 funds. Am I right in assuming that there is really no real trick to this other than to sale them at the rate of taxes I m willing to incur each year Much of the AAPL and TSLA holdings are profit so they are gonna hit me the hardest. If I m right in that assumption what not just pull the bandaid off and do them all now Is there any real benefit to doing them over several years I don t plan on selling everything but do want to move the bulk of stuff to those 3 funds.,reddit,0.961,0.095,0.006,0.899,0.11324674636125565,0.01898902840912342,0.8677641749382019,positive,neutral

2024-08-21,Should I be riskier in my Roth or my normal brokerage I have been researching Roth IRAs as I turn 18 in a few months. I ve seen conflicting information on investment strategies for your Roth. I had originally thought to use the Roth for safer holds like VOO and QQQ but have been seeing some people say to put risk in a Roth and safe in a normal brokerage. I just want to see what you guys do so I can give myself some context to make my own decision. I already have a normal brokerage that holdd VOO QQQ UPRO NEE DVN TSLA and BITU I also am very heavy in crypto so I am definitely holding a fairly aggressive portfolio for some context.

2024-08-22,Waymo says it has doubled its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100 000 since May Waymo has marked a major milestone by doubling its weekly paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. to over 100 000 a significant jump from the 50 000 rides reported in May. This growth was highlighted by co CEO Tekedra Mawakana on LinkedIn showcasing the rapid expansion of Waymo s services across major cities like San Francisco Phoenix Austin and Los Angeles. Waymo a subsidiary of Alphabet is not only increasing its service reach but also advancing its technology. The company recently introduced its generation 6 self driving system which is designed to operate in a broader range of weather conditions while requiring fewer expensive sensors signaling a leap forward in autonomous driving. Backing these technological advancements Alphabet announced in July that it would inject an additional $5 billion into Waymo. This investment underscores Alphabet s commitment to extending Waymo s robotaxi service beyond its current markets primarily in the Sun Belt states. With a fleet of around 700 vehicles Waymo has been steadily expanding its operations including new service areas in San Francisco and a significant enlargement of its coverage in Phoenix. These expansions position Waymo as a leader in the autonomous vehicle market even as it continues to innovate and scale its operations. Despite growing competition globally particularly in China from companies like Didi and Pony.ai Waymo remains at the forefront of the U.S. robotaxi market. Competitors like GM s Cruise have faced setbacks temporarily halting their driverless services while Tesla has yet to fulfill its long promised driverless vehicle capabilities. As Waymo continues to grow and enhance its offerings it solidifies its position as a dominant player in the emerging autonomous vehicle industry.

2024-08-23,Roadside Tesla Semi fire where temperatures reached 1 000 degrees draws in NTSB investigative team A crash and large fire along a California freeway involving an electric Tesla Semi has drawn the attention of federal safety investigators. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it s sending a team of investigators from the Office of Highway Safety mainly to look into fire risks posed by lithium ion batteries. The team will work with the California Highway Patrol to examine the wreckage and gather details about the events leading up to the collision and the subsequent fire response the agency said in a statement. The Los Angeles Times reported that the Tesla rig was traveling east on Interstate 80 around 3 15 a.m. Monday near Emigrant Gap about 70 miles northeast of Sacramento when it went off the road and collided with trees near the right shoulder. The battery caught fire spewing toxic fumes and reaching a temperature of 1 000 degrees forcing firefighters to wait for it to burn out the Highway Patrol told the newspaper. The Tesla driver walked away from the crash and was taken to a hospital and the freeway was temporarily closed. The battery burned into the late afternoon while firefighters tried to cool it down for cleanup and the freeway didn t reopen until 7 20 p.m. authorities said. A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the crash and fire from Tesla. After an investigation that ended in 2021 the NTSB determined that high voltage electric vehicle battery fires pose risks to first responders and that guidelines from manufacturers about how to deal with them were inadequate. The agency which has no enforcement powers and can only make recommendations called for manufacturers to write vehicle specific response guides for fighting battery fires and limiting chemical thermal runaway and reignition. The guidelines also should include information on how to safely store vehicles with damaged lithium ion batteries the agency said. Tesla began delivering the electric Semis in December of 2022 more than three years after CEO Elon Musk said his company would start making the trucks. Musk has said the Semi has a range per charge of 500 miles when pulling an 82 000 pound load.

2024-08-26,Morgan Stanley is cutting its position in Tesla stock. Here s why It seems that Morgan Stanley has finally seen the writing on the wall. Morgan Stanley said it is slashing its position in Tesla stock citing a continued slowdown in the auto industry intense competition among electric vehicles and reduced consumer preferences for EVs. TSLA has been a part of Morgan Stanley s model portfolio since March 2021 with the position increased in both September and December 2022. However the stock was reduced in November 2023. Since the last stake boost in December 2022 Tesla has delivered a 15 return trailing the Russell 1000 Growth Index by 46 Morgan Stanley strategists highlighted. While we continue to hold a position in TSLA due to the optionality of its various nonauto assets we see an attractive opportunity to reallocate some of the position to other less volatile stocks that are not as economically sensitive and may have less pricing pressure they wrote. Despite Tesla s status as the leading electric vehicle company in the U.S. with potential growth avenues in robotics AI and energy storage the strategists have decided to reduce the position to make room for stocks with higher earnings viability such as Spotify . Earlier this week the European Union announced that it would reduce planned tariffs on Tesla vehicles imported from China lowering them from 20.8 to 9 . The EU is also cutting planned import duties for several other electric vehicle manufacturers. These new tariffs will be in addition to the existing 10 duties already imposed by the EU on battery electric vehicle imports. In June the EU indicated it would impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports arguing that these vehicles heavily benefit from unfair subsidies and present a threat of economic injury to European EV producers.,reddit,-0.0056,0.072,0.075,0.852,0.013736856169998646,0.9606394171714783,0.025623664259910583,neutral,negative

2024-08-27,Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he s been dumping the stock because no one wants the company s cars or robots Tesla stock is in a quagmire the longtime investor Ross Gerber has said. He said he d sold about $60 million in Tesla shares amid growing concerns over the carmaker. Gerber told Yahoo Finance that no one seemed interested in buying Tesla s cars anymore. One of Tesla s longtime investors has dumped about half his stake in Elon Musk s carmaker. The shareholder Ross Gerber has said that s because no one seems interested in buying Tesla s cars or robots. Gerber who s been a loud critic of Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022 said he had sold about 60 million worth of his Tesla shares. He told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview that his investment fund still had a $50 million stake in the company. Over time I ve just been sort of lowering my position because I just don t have the same confidence that they re going to achieve the goals that were set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently which is really to sell more cars Gerber said dismissing bullish talk on Tesla s robotics and full self driving tech. That s just a distraction from the fact that they need to sell cars this year and next year and the year after because none of this is coming anytime soon he added. Other Tesla investors have also grown skeptical and impatient over the car company s trajectory. Tesla s stock is down 13 this year largely because of declining sales rising competition in China and drama surrounding Musk s legal battles. Gerber said the used car market was swarmed with old Teslas adding that he d been unable to offload his own Tesla at what he deemed a fair value. It s really a quagmire where you have the best products in an industry but a CEO who doesn t actually work there who doesn t try to sell the cars Gerber said adding We ve seen sales go down and that s what s happening. Sales are going down. If you re expecting a great quarter you re wrong. They re not selling any Teslas here other than basically discount discount discount. And while analysts have made the case that the company is being undervalued as an AI firm Gerber said artificial intelligence was unlikely to save the company. He speculated that demand would be poor for Tesla s humanoid robots given doubts over Musk amid his chaotic revamp of Twitter into X. The simplest way to do it is go around to your neighbors and ask them How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk And the answer is zero OK. Nobody wants a robot from Elon Musk. Why Who would trust it Gerber said adding The last thing I need is some robot built by Elon Musk in my house so I don t know if they thought about the marketing of this at all yet. Musk s leadership of Tesla has been under rising scrutiny from investors and lawmakers over the past few years. Most recently Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla s board of directors calling on the executives to ensure Musk was meeting his financial responsibilities to Tesla shareholders.

2024-08-27,What could stop the NVDIA frenzy What could stop the Nvidia frenzy Two contradictions could stymie the AI chipmaker in chief IF today s stockmarkets have their version of the great wildebeest migration it is the stampede of the Nvidia bulls. Wall Street is no Serengeti and Jim Cramer s high pitched narration no match for the dulcet tones of Sir David Attenborough. But in other respects investors headlong rush into the American chipmaker s shares has been every bit as enthralling a spectacle. Galloping sales of Nvidia s artificial intelligence processors have lifted its market capitalisation from $350bn at the start of 2023 to $1trn then $2trn and then this summer $3trn. In June it overtook Microsoft an AI zealous software giant believed to be the biggest buyer of its chips as It proceeded to lose that title and $900bn in value amid the recent stockmarket panic only to claw back most of its losses in the past few weeks. As the firm prepares to report its latest results on August 28th just about everyone expects another blow out quarter. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang Mr Cramer asked rhetorically on his CNBC show last week referring to Nvidia s boss. These days the Nvidia bear appears to be an endangered species. Or as Sir David might whisper Not an Ursus nvidiaensis in sight. For every hedge fund that trims its stake in the company another seems to do the opposite. Of the 74 Wall Street analysts who cover Nvidia and are tracked by Bloomberg 66 advise buying more of its shares none suggests selling. Their average price target for the stock one year from now implies a market value of around $3.5trn. James Anderson a veteran tech investor who was an early backer teases that Nvidia could be worth $49trn in a decade a shade more than the total value today of the S P 500 index of large American firms. All it would take is consistent annual sales growth of 60 at current operating margins of 60 or so plus some plausible assumptions about cashflow. Investment bankers at Jefferies Goldman Sachs and UBS project that Nvidia s yearly revenues will double this year to over $100bn grow by as much as half in 2025 and by double digits until at least 2027. By then its operating profit could exceed $150bn a third more than Apple tech s most successful money spinner managed last year. The numbers are getting so big so fast that this alone should give the bulls pause. As they catch their breath they might wish to ruminate on two contradictions lurking in Nvidia s long term growth story. The first concerns its main supplier. Nvidia but does not produce them. That falls to a Taiwanese contract chipmaker that dominates the market for the cutting edge silicon that goes into AI servers. As demand for these has rocketed Nvidia has gone from one among many of TSMC s clients to probably its second biggest behind Apple. If it is indeed customer B one of two that represent at least 10 of TSMC s revenues and must thus be disclosed in regulatory filings it spent $7.7bn with TSMC last year up from $5.5bn two years earlier. Given that most of Nvidia s purchase commitments of $19bn for 2025 are likely to end up with TSMC it could soon eclipse the current customer A which handed the Taiwanese firm just shy of $18bn in 2023. Even as Nvidia s and TSMC s fates become more entwined however their product cycles are diverging. Earlier this year Mr Huang vowed to launch a new and improved AI chip every year rather than every couple of years. TSMC is therefore in a mad rush to expand capacity pledging to invest up to $32bn this year and possibly more in 2025. But it still needs at least 18 months to erect a new factory. And because these can cost $20bn a pop careful discussions with clients typically start a year or two in advance. It is unclear how Nvidia s accelerated timeline fits in with TSMC s more measured pace of decision making. In an early sign of trouble Nvidia has delayed shipments of its latest chips called Blackwell by a couple of months owing to technical kinks. Nvidia s reliance on TSMC also highlights the second tension in the bulls case. Because the manufacturer controls the volume and efficiency of production the only way for Nvidia to ensure that it meets investors bullish expectations for sales is to raise prices. A Blackwell chip will cost 20 25 more than the earlier generation which was twice the price of the one before. Each chip is more powerful than the last so the cost per unit of computing power is probably declining. But not fast enough for customers. In August Andy Jassy chief executive of Amazon whose cloud computing arm is a big user of Nvidia chips acknowledged that he had heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance . His company is investing in its own designs. So are Google Meta Microsoft and Tesla. a rival chip designer has gone from almost no AI chip sales in 2022 to a forecast $5bn this year. On August 19th it said it would buy ZT Systems a server maker helping it to compete with Nvidia s end to end offering. Chinese tech champions such as Huawei barred by American sanctions from procuring top end Nvidia gear may forge breakthroughs that could do to Nvidia s market share what Chinese competitors like BYD did to Tesla s in electric cars. Exit pursued by a bear Assuming a killer app eventually emerges which it hasn t yet generative ai is unlikely to become widely used unless it gets much cheaper a ChatGPT query can cost seven times more to answer than Google search. Nvidia may soon have to choose between lowering prices to support its growth or maintaining prices to protect its profit margin. For now Nvidia bulls think they can have it both ways. The whiff of irrational exuberance may become too overwhelming for U. nvidiaensis to resist.,reddit,0.9932,0.096,0.061,0.843,0.09777731448411942,0.07158908247947693,0.8306335210800171,positive,neutral
2024-08-27,Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he s been dumping the stock because no one wants the company s cars or robots Ross Gerber a longtime Tesla shareholder has expressed concern about the company s performance stating that the used car market is flooded with old Teslas. He recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla stock is stuck in a quagmire prompting him to sell about $60 million worth of shares due to growing concerns about the carmaker s future. Gerber a vocal critic of Elon Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022 revealed that he s reduced his Tesla holdings by about half maintaining a $50 million stake. He cited a lack of confidence in Tesla s ability to achieve its goals especially in selling more cars. I ve been gradually lowering my position because I just don t have the same confidence that they re going to achieve the goals they set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently he said downplaying the significance of Tesla s robotics and self driving technology.Other Tesla investors are also becoming wary with Tesla s stock down 13 this year amid declining sales increased competition in China and Musk s ongoing legal issues. Gerber noted that the market is saturated with used Teslas and mentioned his own difficulties in selling his Tesla at a fair price. It s really a quagmire when you have top tier products but a CEO who s not fully engaged in the business or in selling cars Gerber said. Sales are declining and if you re expecting a stellar quarter you re mistaken. Tesla is mainly selling cars at a discount now. Despite some analysts suggesting Tesla is undervalued as an AI company Gerber is skeptical. He believes the demand for Tesla s humanoid robots will be minimal especially given Musk s erratic behavior and his controversial overhaul of Twitter into X. The simplest way to gauge interest is to ask around How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk The answer is likely zero Gerber remarked. Who would trust it The last thing I need is a robot made by Elon Musk in my house. Musk s leadership has faced increasing scrutiny from both investors and lawmakers.

2024-08-31,I think Alphabet is the most undervalued stock in the stock market right now I am 100 invested in Alphabet due to several reasons. I think we are in a similar situation to Meta when it was faced with law suits reached 90$ last year and everybody said it would die. 1. Alphabet is growing in the double digits every year since its inception. Its PE is on the way to below 20 and laughably cheap for a tech company with that growth. 3. They crushed earnings and the only reason for their slump afterwards was their heavy AI spending which they can easily cut if they see its not worth it anymore. Also comparable to Meta. 2. Alphabet is a leader in innovative technologies such as autonomous driving. Tesla shot up 40 or something when Elon made another promise towards autonomous driving while Google actually is the first mover and build up a network with hundred thousands of paying users. 3. I dont think that AI will be as useful as some still expect. But in no way Google is endangered by that. I dont have more recent numbers but in July Googles market share in the search business grew slightly while ChatGPT declined by 12 . I think the summarised answers in Google search are already way more useful and convenient than what Bing or ChatGPT offers. 4. If AI presents itself as useful Google and Meta will have the best model. People misunderstand how AI works. Its not the model which is important its the underlying set of data. With the deal it closed with Reddit beginning of 2024 google honestly struck Gold for a really cheap price. 5. Tech companies are literally what keeps the american economy and influence in the world right now alive. I think its not realistic to think that the DOJ will do anything which substancially weakens an american tech company at this point. They will probably get a slap on the wrist in a way of a fine. But priced in is currently a potential break up. 6. Atleast for the next earnings I expect an ad revenue short squeeze because of the really polarized american election. Way more money will be invested in ads than in previous elections and while the sum on its own isnt that much depending on how elastic the ad market is it will drive up ad space for everyone involved.,reddit,0.9662,0.096,0.042,0.862,0.1132439374923706,0.32818400859832764,0.5585720539093018,positive,neutral

2024-09-02,BYD sales hit a record in August despite broader China EV slowdown Chinese electric car giant BYD sold a record number of passenger vehicles in August with sales of hybrids growing faster than those of battery only cars. The company said August sales rose by 30 year on year to 370 854 passenger cars. Its sales of battery only cars rose by nearly 12 while hybrid powered vehicle sales surged by 48 to account for just under two thirds of BYD cars sold last month. In contrast several new energy vehicle startups saw a dip in deliveries last month. Li Auto best known for its range extender vehicles reported 48 122 deliveries in August down from a record 51 000 in July. Aito which uses Huawei technology said it delivered 31 216 cars last month down by more than 10 000 vehicles from the prior month. Huawei is selling the Aito trademark and patents to automaker Seres for 2.5 billion yuan . Lower priced cars hitting the market Nio said it delivered 20 176 cars in August down slightly from July but above 20 000 for a fourth straight month. The company s lower priced brand Onvo opened 105 stores on Sunday as it prepares to begin for deliveries for its first car the L60 SUV this month. Nio is scheduled to report earnings on Friday. Xpeng reported 14 036 car deliveries in August its best month for the year so far. The company said on Friday it began some deliveries of its newly launched mass market Mona M03 electric car that sells for the equivalent of less than $20 000 in China. It was not clear whether those M03 deliveries were included in the total figure Xpeng reported. Geely backed Zeekr reported a month on month increase to 18 015 deliveries in August but that was down from 20 206 deliveries in June. Undercutting Tesla and going global Zeekr on Friday said it would launch its first SUV this month with a price more than $1 400 lower than Tesla s Model Y. The U.S. listed Chinese company said it aims to deliver the SUV globally by the end of this year but did not specify which countries or regions. BYD said it sold 31 451 cars overseas last month pushing the year to date total to 264 869 and above the 242 765 cars it sold abroad for all of last year. If BYD keeps up its average monthly overseas sales pace through the end of December the company will sell just under 400 000 cars outside China this year according to CNBC calculations. Xiaomi only said it delivered more than 10 000 cars in August for a third straight month. In mid July CEO Lei Jun said the company aimed to deliver 100 000 units of its SU7 electric sedan by the end of November. That indicates Xiaomi needs to deliver an average of at least 16 000 cars a month from August to November according to CNBC calculations of reported data. The smartphone company began mass deliveries of the SU7 in April at a price about $4 000 less than Tesla s Model 3.

2024-09-04,CIBC Broker Cucked Me on $TSLZ I took a short trade on TSLA today when the stock peaked at $121.78 and bought 125 shares of $TSLZ 2x inverse leveraged TSLA on my CIBC TFSA USD balance. Checked my order status afterwards on the position fill and the order filled on a buy to cover margin . Called the CIBC Investors Edge contact line some Indian dude picked up and I went through the whole situation. He said Sir you don t hold any ETFS I said check my order fills the shares were buy to covered on a non existent margin . The guy went silent for roughly a full minute and then proceeded to put me on hold without any explanation after 15 minutes he resumed and said I have to call you back I m sending this to the back office . Now all my cash is frozen in my account and I can t place any trades. Has anyone had anything like this ever happen The brokerage now owns the shares because the order got filled and at the time of screenshot were up nearly $75 profit.

2024-09-05,Thursday s Pre Market News Stock Movers morning traders and investors of the r stocks sub Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start Here are your pre market stock movers news on this Thursday September the 5th 2024 Stock futures were flat Thursday as Wall Street looks to regain momentum after a rocky start to September. Key labor market data is also on deck this week. Futures for the S P 500 were up marginally while Nasdaq 100 futures hovered near the flatline. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 50 points. The moves come after the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each closed lower for the second straight session dipping 0.16 and 0.30 respectively. The Dow squeezed out a gain of 38 points or 0.09 on Wednesday. All three averages are down for the week with key employment reports looming. On Thursday morning investors will get to sift through weekly jobless claims data while the August nonfarm payrolls report is due out Friday. The market has appeared to be sensitive to potential growth scares in recent weeks including Tuesday s sell off on the heels of weak manufacturing data. That could put increased importance on the jobless claims data BMO Wealth Management chief investment officer Yung Yu Ma said on Closing Bell. That s more of a forward looking indicator. As long as those stay low people have jobs people remain confident in the ability to find jobs or comfortable in the jobs that they have we think that they will continue to spend. So as long as those numbers stay low if we get some blips in the overall monthly jobs report that shows weakness on the edges we re not quite as concerned Ma said. The employment data could play a key role in the Federal Reserve s interest rate decision later this month. Ma said he still believes the U.S. economy is on track for a soft landing and that the market rally should eventually broaden out. However he added that there is likely to be continued market turbulence in the near term. We believe in it we just think it s going to be on pause for a few months because this high degree of uncertainty we have right now. There s just too much that needs to resolved over the coming months. It s just very hard for the broadening of the market theme to really gather momentum Ma said.

2024-09-08,Is what I m doing with my gains dumb Hey yall wanted to run this by you... Been investing for a few years now not nearly enough of an expert but know my way around. I have a few positions that I have gains of about 20 30 on. I ve been thinking about cashing them out and putting them in VOO to lock them in while giving them the opportunity to grow as well. Does this make sense I still would invest regularly into these individual stocks as I pretty much do recurring buys weekly but is this a good way to lock in gains Any other recommendations,reddit,0.9731,0.2,0.017,0.783,0.0812535285949707,0.014799805358052254,0.9039466977119446,positive,neutral

I currently have 12 different stocks in my investment portfolio which I invest $25 into each stock on the 1st and 15th of each month so in total I invest $600 month into the stock market. I have two questions 1. Is 12 stocks a decent amount for a diversified portfolio and 2. Is $600 month a good amount to invest every month since I plan on being a long term investor I m talking 30 years of investment. Also below I have listed the 12 companies i currently have stock in Byrna Technologies INC. Monster Beverage Corporation Nvidia Corporation Amazon.com Inc. JPMorgan Chase Co. Netflix Inc.

2024-09-12,Oracle trails only Nvidia among large cap tech this year as Ellison closes in on Bezos Larry Ellison turned 80 last month. It s been a celebratory year. While fellow legacy tech players Intel and Cisco struggle to find their footing in a world driven increasingly by the promise of artificial intelligence Oracle has emerged as a Wall Street darling. Following a better than expected after the close on Monday the stock popped 11 on Tuesday. It gained more steam on Wednesday closing at a record $157.10. Oracle has seen double digit gains following each of its three quarterly reports this year driven by the company s cloud businesses. The stock didn t have a single double digit increase last year and had only one in 2022. The excitement is back Guggenheim analysts titled their post earnings report highlighting momentum across all business. Oracle shares are now up 49 this year trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia up 136 among large cap tech stocks. The next best performer in the group is Meta which has gained 45 . Intel meanwhile has lost 60 of its value and Cisco is down almost 3 . Both companies announced major layoffs in their earnings reports last month. The biggest financial winner from Oracle s rally is Ellison who founded the software company in 1977 and remains chairman. He owns over 40 of the outstanding stock and has seen his net worth swell to $192 billion according to Forbes. Only Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos are wealthier. By the standards of high growth tech Oracle remains fairly plodding. Revenue increased 8 in the latest quarter from a year earlier to $13.31 billion. For the current period growth is expected to be between 8 and 10 CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call. Since 2011 Oracle has had only one year of double digit revenue growth 18 in fiscal 2023 and four times the company has contracted. After 13 years of single digit organic total revenue growth Oracle is reaccelerating into the double digits JMP analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday bumping up their rating to buy from hold. We remain very EPS confident and committed to full year total revenue growth growing double digits. Oracle is currently in the midst of its CloudWorld conference which wraps up on Thursday in Las Vegas. Between the earnings report and the annual event investors are applauding the company s cloud story including both its infrastructure business and its databases. While Oracle is still way behind Amazon Web Services Microsoft and Google in terms of cloud infrastructure market share the business has turned into a big growth driver for the company. Revenue in the unit surged 45 in the quarter from a year earlier to $2.2 billion. In addition to competing with the top cloud companies Oracle is increasingly partnering with them. A year ago Ellison visited Microsoft s headquarters outside of Seattle for the first time announcing a collaboration with a company he d competed with for more than 30 years. On Monday Oracle said its database software will become available for AWS customers to use atop Oracle hardware sitting inside of Amazon data centers. Oracle has forged such arrangements with all three major cloud infrastructure vendors in the past year. We believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come Ellison said on Monday s earnings call. Oracle didn t immediately provide a comment for this story. No more passwords For years Ellison described Oracle s database as autonomous playing into the hype around self driving cars and the emergence of AI. Its product wouldn t need manual patching and wouldn t have downtime and Ellison said no other cloud provider could do it. But of late he s benefitted from playing nice. After years of criticizing AWS at events Ellison decided to ensure that clients are able to use Amazon s market leading cloud with Oracle s full featured database. Of course customers have been able to use Oracle inside of AWS for a long time AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC in a recent interview. But the new offering will allow clients to easily sign up in the AWS marketplace of third party software make backups and move data to AWS analytics tools Garman said. Garman who replaced Adam Selipsky as AWS CEO in June added that clients had been asking the two companies to figure out how to work more closely together. As Ellison digs deeper into AI and enters his 81st year on the planet he s now taking on passwords which he calls utterly ridiculous because they re insecure and can be easily hacked. This is the way log on is going to work Ellison said on the earnings call. I m going to type in Larry.Ellison.com the computer is going to look at me and say OK Hi Larry. We re done. He went on to say that Catz can recognize him as can his kids so there s no reason his computer shouldn t be able to the same. No more passwords he said. Those have got to go.

2024-09-12,Opportunity In Oracle I ve been hearing how oracle expects 9 revenue growth for FY 25 they also said for Q3 and Q4 24 they had signed their largest contracts to date. I ve also heard examples of how d they d apply their tech. One example tied to the medical industry. Say a doctor wanted to pull up past CT scans MRIs or other tests when meeting with a patient they can voice request these from Oracles database. Hospital physician offices and dentists offices at least in my area always feel like they have some of the most outdated data systems I ve ever seen. Whether or not hospital managers feel like forking out money to upgrade is another question but if they were to upgrade to something this feels like it would actually improve efficiency. I ve heard from Oracle execs before around integration of AI in automating some data pulls. It seems like something that s been on their radar for years. To me this seems like a value offering of their DBMS and their cloud Services. I m a little skeptical on near term feasibility of the more complex things Oracle claims on automated analyses. In practice there s so much nuance to data that I wouldn t currently trust this to handle complex questions that require strategic thinking and business knowledge. So personally I don t buy claims around complex analyses anytime soon. One other thing was Oracle is also quite literally designing data centers that would be powered by SMRs in addition to expanding their existing data center footprints. SMRs historically have been quite expensive to install but curious to see if there are long term cost savings by doing this. It seems like they have a feasible vision for how the products can be used everyday and commercialized. On one hand you have companies like Tesla promising C 3PO and on the other hand companies like Oracle are promising something that feels much closer and real with practical use cases. What are other things you think might drive value or detract value to Oracle in the future. Do you think it s overvalued Also did anyone have any interesting reads around this to share Trying to learn more about their business plan.,reddit,0.997,0.174,0.006,0.82,0.10986164957284927,0.027874281629920006,0.8622640371322632,positive,neutral

Through training they learn to refine their thinking process try different strategies and recognize their mistakes. As examples of the new models power OpenAI noted that they can be used by healthcare researchers to annotate cell sequencing data and by physicists to generate complicated mathematical formulas needed for quantum optics. The potential of the new AI models was also highlighted by Noam Brown a research scientist at the company.

2024-09-13,Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride sharing trips in Austin and Atlanta Uber announced Friday it is expanding its partnership with Alphabet s Waymo to offer robotaxi rides in Austin Texas and Atlanta beginning in early 2025. Shares of Uber jumped 5 on the news while Alphabet rose about 1 . Uber riders in those cities can be matched with a driverless Waymo car for some trips according to the companies. The rides will only be available through Uber s app unlike in San Francisco and Los Angeles where riders book through the Waymo app. A Waymo spokesperson said it had no plans to partner with Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The expansion comes as Uber faces investor pressure to step up its autonomous vehicle strategy especially ahead of Tesla s planned robotaxi event slated for Oct. 10. Shares of Uber have fallen 9 since the Tesla event was announced and are off 17 from their 52 week highs. It may also slow Waymo encroachment into Uber s market share. An analysis from Bernstein estimated that as of May 2024 Waymo s 50 000 weekly paid rides made up approximately 2 of ride sharing usage in San Francisco. Since then Waymo has doubled its paid robotaxi trips to 100 000 a week the company announced. We re thrilled to build on our successful partnership with Waymo which has already powered fully autonomous trips for tens of thousands of riders in Phoenix Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a release. Uber s initial agreement with Waymo in Phoenix also included autonomous Uber Eats deliveries in the city. The expansion into Austin and Atlanta won t include Uber Eats at first according to the Waymo spokesperson but they re exploring that possibility for the future. Waymo co CEO Tekedra Mawakana said We ve been delighted at the positive feedback from our Waymo One riders to date and we can t wait to bring the comfort convenience and safety of the Waymo Driver to these cities in partnership with Uber. The expansion into two more cities is another step in Uber s advancement into the robotaxi space after struggling to get a foothold and selling off its own self driving division in 2020 now relying on partnerships with companies including Waymo GM s Cruise and the SoftBank backed U.K. startup Wayve to gain ground. Uber shares dipped in August after the company announced a multiyear partnership with Cruise to offer autonomous rides through its app next year. Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski cited Cruise s previous safety challenges as a part of the investor skepticism along with now fulfilled hopes for a partnership with Waymo instead. Waymo has rapidly made strides in the self driving race. It currently offers robotaxi services to the public in San Francisco Los Angeles and Phoenix. It has logged more than 22 million miles through June of this year and last week it released a report that argued its vehicles are safer than human drivers. It began testing driverless cars on Bay Area freeways with Google employees in August. Some analysts were more hopeful for a potential Uber and Waymo expansion into San Francisco. But Atlanta and Austin where Waymo has already begun testing may still help sentiment.

2024-09-14,Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride hailing trips in Austin and Atlanta Uber is taking its partnership with Alphabet s Waymo to new heights announcing plans to offer autonomous ride hailing services in Austin and Atlanta starting in early 2025. This move comes after the duo s initial success with robotaxi services in Phoenix and now Uber riders in these two cities will have the chance to hop into a driverless Waymo vehicle for certain trips exclusively through the Uber app. The expansion marks a significant step for Uber in the robotaxi game following the company s sale of its self driving division back in 2020. Since then Uber has been leaning on partnerships with companies like Waymo GM s Cruise and U.K. based Wayve to re enter the autonomous vehicle space. Uber shares popped 5 on the news while Alphabet saw a 1 rise. Investors have been nudging Uber to ramp up its autonomous vehicle strategy especially ahead of Tesla s upcoming robotaxi event in October. Uber s shares are down 17 from their 52 week high partly in response to the increased competition. Waymo which has been steadily gaining traction reported doubling its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100 000 in San Francisco. Waymo s co CEO Tekedra Mawakana expressed excitement about expanding to Austin and Atlanta adding that they are exploring future Uber Eats integrations in these cities. The competition in the self driving space is heating up and Uber s latest move aims to solidify its position alongside major players like Waymo and Cruise.

2024-09-17,$LIFFF another mining stock in prime position to benefit from the EV revolution. As of late it hasn t been looking too good for Donald Trump from an unbiased point of view it seems like the abundance of sentiment that arose post assassination attempt has fed from those hitting the polls come Election Day. So I thought to myself what markets stand to benefit from a Kamala Harris victory EV producers But then I read here on Reddit that mining stocks are on the rise and after some research I m inclined to agree with said OP. But you can t mine electricity so who s to supply for the surplus of electric vehicles being produced by Tesla and other companies Lithium miners. Since lithium is a key mineral necessary for the production of large rechargeable batteries I went looking around to see who might be in a solid market position for the amount of lithium necessary to power this EV revolution leading me to Li FT Power Ltd. . $LIFTF is a Canadian based lithium mining company that s primary business involves the acquisition exploration and development of hard rock lithium properties. It was announced recently that the company quadrupled the size of their large mining project within Northwest Territories Canada nicknamed the Cali Project. It s said they have an additional 9 681 hectares of claims upon government approval of an amendment that allows new staking to be completed in the area. I plan on looking a lot further into this company.

I guess I recognized the Delta logo on many of my own power supplies. Therefore the question Regarding the growth of almost 2000 in the last five years for Delta Electronics Thailand do you think power supplies is still a worthy investment From them Because of our outstanding performance in quality and reliability Delta has earned vendor awards from major customers such as Asus Cisco Dell HP IBM NCR NEC Nortel Philips Xerox and others.

2024-09-19,Are European automakers headed for a death spiral I don t intend to exaggerate but I am getting the sense that the auto industry in Europe is on its death bed. Falling Euro EV Sales Shrinking EV Share EV deliveries in the region s biggest car market fell 69 during August fueling a 36 drop across the region the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said Thursday. With the battery car market share shrinking to 14 in August down from just over 15 last year Germany cutting subsidies was a big blow to the industry. From same Across Europe new car registrations dropped 16.5 compared to a year ago to 755 717 million units last month with declines also in France and Italy. The UK was the only major market where EV sales rose gaining 10.8 . European plants are underutilized because they make more than they need. One in three European factories of carmaking behemoths like BMW Mercedes Stellantis Renault and Volkswagen is underutilized. In some of their plants less than half of the vehicles that could theoretically be produced are actually being made. Examples of hard hit companies VW is planning to layoff 15K possibly closing 2 3 plants in Germany . Ending job security program that prevents layoffs through 2029. VW union workers are not happy and are threatening strikes. BMW cutting guidance for operating margins by 200 basis points . Stellantis plant in Italy facing 60 fall in production in 2024. The Threat of Chinese Exports to US Europe Meanwhile China is the new auto giant. while the US is at 100 . In past years I ve always heard that Chinese cars are junk. Junk cars wouldn t need to need to have their price doubled to keep consumers from buying them. In other countries Chinese brands are taking over the nascent EV market Chinese automakers accounted for 88 of the EV market in Brazil and 70 in Thailand in the first quarter of this year. In Europe despite tariffs Chinese carmakers share of passenger car sales in Europe rose to 17 in the first seven months of 2024 from 12 a year earlier according to data from automotive consultancy Inovev and Chinese car exports have reached record highs this year. Shifts in China s Domestic Markets The Chinese automobile renaissance is killing foreign producers in China yet another sign that these cars in China are actually comparable quality. Foreign brands market share of Chinese auto sales is tracking at a record low of 37 per cent in the first seven months of 2024 down from 64 per cent in 2020 according to data from Automobility a Shanghai consultancy. So far this year US brands are down more than 23 per cent while Japanese Korean and German carmakers have also suffered double digit declines the data showed. By contrast sales of Chinese brands are up nearly 22 per cent with Chinese companies overwhelmingly dominating sales of the EV market. being shocked by the quality of Chinese EVs in a test drive. Technological Edge in EVs for China versus 10 for the US and 21 for Europe. Aren t the US EU supposed to be championing the green revolution in autos BYD had a 5 share of Chinese cars in 2022 today it s 20 . That s a big threat to Tesla for instance who gets 20 of its revenue from China. Possible Bull Case So is there a bull case for VW Here is a . Closing Thoughts How are European automakers going to handle the competitive threat of a new Chinese auto juggernaut along with massive fiscal support in the US Their energy prices face much higher spikes .

2024-09-20,Friday s Pre Market News Stock Movers Friday morning traders and investors of the r stocks sub Welcome to the final trading day of the week. Here are your pre market movers news on this Friday September the 20th 2024 Dow Jones Industrial Average futures flickered near the flatline Friday after the 30 stock benchmark closed at a record bolstered by enthusiasm over the Federal Reserve s interest rate cut. Dow futures slipped just 21 points or 0.05 . Futures tied to the S P 500 dipped 0.3 while Nasdaq 100 futures slipped 0.5 . Stocks surged during Thursday s regular session with the S P 500 rising 1.7 to close over the 5 700 level for the first time. The blue chip Dow ended the day more than 500 points higher to post its first ever close above 42 000. Both indexes also registered all time highs during the day. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.5 . Unemployment data along with the Fed s half point rate cut on Wednesday seemed to bolster investors sentiment. Initial jobless claims which came in at 219 000 for the week of Sept. 14 were lower than expected and showed a decline from the prior week. The first economic data point since the jumbo rate cut should please the Fed said Chris Larkin managing director of trading and investing for E Trade from Morgan Stanley. Lower than expected jobless claims won t raise any immediate concerns about the labor market slowing too much. The Fed s Wednesday decision marked the first rate cut since 2020. The three major averages are on pace for weekly gains with the S P 500 up nearly 1.6 through Thursday s close. The Dow is toting a 1.5 jump on the week while the Nasdaq is outperforming with a 1.9 advance.

2024-09-22,Webull Is There a Better Way Morning all I ve been interested in investing many years now. Eventually I put some money together right before the pandemic and opened a RobinHood account. I had nothing to compare it to and at that time I was just investing so I didn t see any problems with it. Simply put I had no expectations. Fast forward 2 3 years a good friend gets heavy into TSLA and options. When I was trading on Robinhood back in the day I became aware of options but had trouble understanding them. Anyway the past year talking to my friend he explained them to me and I got the hang of it and the importance of charting candles levels the whole 9 yards. Then as he was still learning himself he kind of ran out of things to teach me so I ended up immersing myself in learning about charting and the technical analysis. My major was economics and I work in business so I had a pretty strong understanding of economics and the market generally. I eventually read a bunch Martin J Pring s 800 page Understanding Technical Analysis was especially helpful as was investopedia. Anyway my friend invited me to Webull told me its the shit so I said why not. After a month of getting the hang of it using the papertrade feature and just generally getting comfortable and configuring it how I wanted I dropped some money it. Things are going well but I have two issues. 1. I d like to have one Roth type brokerage account elsewhere and then daytrade swingtrade out of the other one. 2. I d prefer to not use a Chinese app. After doing a lot of research based on reviews I narrowed it down to the following Fidelity IBKR Etrade ThinkorSwim Moomoo What I m looking for is something comparable to Webull s really fantastic UI charting tools and its superb integrated access to company financials. It also has customizable screens watchlists and has yet to bug out on me. I also make 5 on my cash balance. My options fees under 500 contracts are also free whereas on the US brokerages the norm seems to be 0.65 per contract. I downloaded TOS and it s pretty awkward compared to Webull especially the charting and although it does kind of work its tedious af however I can chart on webull or other software if need be. Downloaded E trade and again while not as strong as Webull its more intuitive than TOS at least. I checked out the reviews for Fidelity on the app store and they were almost universally extremely negative. IBKR while getting slightly better reviews still got quite awful reviews from users in the app store especially in regards to filling option orders and something about only being able to do simple calls and puts not condors straddles etc. I have yet to try MooMoo . I may have to default to RobinHood for my investment account and can use other apps for advanced research and charting.

2024-09-24,Opportunities in Hydrogen There s a lot of opportunity in the hydrogen sector. Governments and businesses are investing big money to make this happen. One example is Texas who aims to be the hydrogen capital of the world. Texas received a $70 million grant from the Federal Highway Administration supporting the creation of a hydrogen trucking corridor for medium and heavy duty trucks. The funding will go toward the construction of up to five stations across Dallas Fort Worth Houston Austin and San Antonio with the eventual goal of building a corridor between Texas and Southern California. Additionally Texas is the site of the HyVelocity Hydrogen Hub one of seven regional clean hydrogen hubs selected by the U.S. Department of Energy to receive up to $1.2 billion in funding. HyVelocity Hub participants Air Liquide Chevron ExxonMobil and Sempra Infrastructure are also part of the Texas Hydrogen Alliance. Let s not forget Japan who have bet big on Hydrogen as well. Japan s first strategy released in December 2017 was the world s first national hydrogen strategy however the energy landscape has changed drastically since then. Japan s revised strategy intends to generate public and private sector investment in hydrogen worth 15 trillion yen over the next 15 years and increase the use of hydrogen six fold by 2040. Then you have vehicle makers like BMW Honda Skoda Hyundai Toyota Tesla investing in hydrogen tech as well. One Hydrogen company which is bringing innovation to the sector is SunHydrogen They have recently joined the Texas Hydrogen Alliance and will be a key player in the production of hydrogen. The examples I have provided are just a small sample of what s happening in the sector. There s an abundance of investment and innovation currently and I truly believe any barriers will be broken over the coming years. $HYSR,reddit,0.9852,0.127,0.009,0.864,0.2645092308521271,0.010477268137037754,0.7250134944915771,positive,neutral
2024-09-24,How can I get more trade opportunities I trade monday through friday from 9 30 to 12 00 EST. I trade MSFT AMD TSLA NVDA APPL and GOOG. I trade supply and demand on the 15 minute time frame. Last week I took one trade because it was the only setup I got that hit all my confirmations. I am wondering what I can do to be able to take more trades. Here s what I do to find a good trade 1. Look for aggressive buying or selling 2. Look to see if price is in an uptrend or downtrend depending on the direction of the aggressive move. Then create a supply or demand zone using the previous candle or group of candles depending on how big the candles are. 3. Wait for price to come back to the zone. Price must come back gradually and not aggressively. 4. Look for some kind of confirmation that the price will go in the desired direction. This can be an engulfing candle a hammer or a morning evening star pattern. 5. Enter after I receive conformation. If taking a demand trade set stop loss at the bottom of the demand zone. If taking a supply zone set stop loss at the top of the supply zone. Set take profit at the high low of the aggressive move or set TP to where I get a 2 1 ratio.,reddit,-0.0669,0.065,0.085,0.85,0.05054019019007683,0.04949032887816429,0.8999694585800171,negative,neutral

2024-09-27,Safety Disaster Tesla FSD Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition Tesla s FSD which is now promoted as fully supervised is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch. Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone. With just two weeks to go for Tesla Inc. s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company s self driving technology. What Happened Tesla s FSD which is now promoted as fully supervised FSD is a safety disaster and galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition said GLJ Research s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla s competitors in this arena are Alphabet Inc. s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp. s GM Cruise. With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China the Elon Musk led company would be up against domestic player Baidu Inc. s BIDU Apollo Go. Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing which tried the technology said the overall performance of Tesla s camera enabled autonomous driving software is suspect. In a report released on Tuesday the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. In fact our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation an average of once every 13 miles it said. While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels it said. The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split second events that even professional drivers operating with a test mindset must focus on catching it added. Johnson also referred to data from which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences data in real time from users which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city. Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows Waymo 17 311 miles Amazon Inc. s AMZN Zoox 177 602 miles 17 077 miles WeRide 21 191 miles The metric for Tesla is 13 miles based on AMCI s statistics Johnson said although Tesla doesn t yet report data to California DMV given its FSD tech is only Level 2. Why It s Important Johnson noted that many sell side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla s FSD technology. In real time the value is close to zero he said adding that it could be negative given the liability of putting something this dangerous on roads. According to Ark s valuation model by 2029 robotaxis which has FSD as its core technology would account for 63 of Tesla s revenue and 86 of EBITDA. Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black a Tesla bull said in a recent post on X that Tesla s FSD is not yet close to the 99.99 efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy. In premarket trading on Thursday Tesla rose 2.05 to $262.30 Source,reddit,-0.8276,0.045,0.057,0.898,0.03567090258002281,0.22777773439884186,0.7365514039993286,negative,neutral

2024-09-30,The Race for U.S. Lithium Independence in the EV Revolution Lithium demand is projected to quadruple by 2030 driven by the electric vehicle boom and increasing global energy storage needs. Li FT Power has strengthened its lithium portfolio through key projects in Canada including its recent acquisition of 9 681 hectares in the Little Nahanni Pegmatite District. With a price target of $9.25 CAD and a potential upside of 240 Li FT Power offers a strong investment opportunity in the growing lithium market. The electric vehicle boom led by companies like Tesla Nio and Stellantis has brought global attention to lithium a vital resource for the EV industry. Governments and corporations are racing to secure it for future energy needs. Despite having its own lithium reserves the United States currently produces only 1 of the global supply making it heavily dependent on foreign sources especially China. To safeguard its energy future and reduce reliance on geopolitical rivals the U.S. must ramp up domestic lithium production significantly. Lithium Abundance vs. Production Concentration Though lithium is widely distributed across the globe its production is dominated by a handful of countries. Australia Chile China and Argentina produce over 95 of the world s lithium. However the United States holds significant untapped reserves particularly in Nevada North Carolina and California. These states are estimated to contain about 4 of the world s lithium deposits making the U.S. home to some of the largest reserves outside the Lithium Triangle in South America. Despite this U.S. production remains limited compared to global leaders. As the electric vehicle industry accelerates lithium demand is projected to surge. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence forecasts that by 2030 annual lithium demand will hit 2.4 million tons four times the expected production for 2024. To support this growing need the Inflation Reduction Act introduces $370 billion in incentives for domestic EV and battery production aiming to reduce reliance on imports. Additionally earlier in 2023 the Department of Energy committed $3 billion to boost the U.S. EV supply chain following the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law s passage which further emphasizes localizing production and bolstering the clean energy industry. This initiative is going to coordinate the effort across the federal government and work closely with the private sector labor unions Tribes community organizations and our partners and allies abroad It s going to secure America s electric vehicle battery supply chain and clean energy future President Joe Biden China s Strategic Control Over the Lithium Supply Chain China s dominance over the global lithium supply chain is a result of strategic investments and policies aimed at controlling critical minerals. According to a 2021 White House report between 2009 and 2019 China funneled $100 billion in subsidies rebates and tax exemptions to its companies and consumers to capture the lithium refining market before demand skyrocketed. This gave China a powerful position as both the largest consumer of unrefined lithium and the leading producer of refined lithium. China has employed anti competitive tactics such as subsidizing production even when demand was low and dumping products at below market prices to outcompete international players. Chinese companies have also invested heavily in lithium mines around the world ensuring their access to the supply. This strategy mirrors China s actions in controlling other critical minerals like cobalt graphite and nickel further entrenching its global mineral dominance. America must reduce its reliance on China and other adversaries for critical minerals Our nation s dependence on foreign sources for these materials creates a serious threat to our national and economic security Senator Gary Peters My Stock Pick Li FT Power for America s Independency The reason why I am mentioning Li FT Power is because the company focuses on acquiring exploring and developing high potential lithium pegmatite projects in Canada. Its flagship asset the Yellowknife Lithium Project in the Northwest Territories is key covering a large portion of the Yellowknife Pegmatite Province known for significant lithium pegmatite formations. Along with this Li FT holds three promising early stage exploration properties in Quebec and is advancing the Cali Project in the Little Nahanni Pegmatite Group further strengthening its position in the lithium market. On September 3 2024 Li FT Power announced a significant expansion of its operational area in the Little Nahanni Pegmatite District located in the Northwest Territories Canada. The company acquired an additional 9 681 hectares at its Cali Project which includes outcropping spodumene pegmatites a crucial lithium bearing mineral linked to the broader Cali dyke swarm that the company has been actively mapping. This expansion was made possible following the N ts hch oh Amendments to the Saht Land Use Plan in June 2024 which provided new opportunities for staking claims in the region. These amendments were expected after receiving endorsement from the Saht Secretariat Incorporated and the Government of the Northwest Territories back in 2019. As of September 20 2024 Li FT Power s stock is trading at $2.72 CAD with a market capitalization of $107.24 million CAD. In terms of future projections analysts have set a 12 month price target of $9.25 CAD representing a potential upside of 240.07 with estimates ranging from a low of $8.50 CAD to a high of $10.00 CAD. The company s share structure includes 42.7 million outstanding shares and an additional 1.07 million options for a fully diluted total of 43.8 million shares. Ownership remains concentrated with 55 held by founders 17 by institutional investors 25 by retail investors and 3 by management and directors. Top institutional shareholders include Commodity Capital AG Extract Capital and Tribeca Investment Partners. Conclusion Lithium is becoming an increasingly vital resource as the demand for electric vehicles surges yet production remains concentrated in a few countries like Australia Chile China and Argentina. While the U.S. holds significant untapped reserves production has not kept pace with global leaders. To address this the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provide substantial funding to boost domestic lithium production and reduce reliance on China which dominates the lithium refining market. Companies like Li FT Power are poised to benefit from these trends with their strategic lithium projects in Canada. Recent expansions in the Northwest Territories position Li FT to capitalize on rising demand. With analysts projecting a 240 stock price increase Li FT offers strong growth potential supported by its concentrated ownership and promising lithium assets.,reddit,0.9984,0.13,0.03,0.84,0.8773077726364136,0.01119961403310299,0.11149260401725769,positive,positive

2024-10-01,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S P 500. Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless I think the post is super relevant and for some reason the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours despite it receiving over 2.2 million views and over 1100 shares. The ride the market has been on quite simply has been insane. According to generally accepted wisdom by investing in the S P 500 you can anticipate to double your money on average every 6.5 years. I m not 100 certain as to why that s the accepted figure as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64 . Below is a chart of the average price rate of return of GSPC over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn t easily find data prior to this..

The Median value has it under 18x and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at 10x. Currently the P E ratio sits at 28.71 roughly 150 of what is normal. In the history of the S P the P E ratio has hit this level only 3 times... Immediately preceding and then during the Dot Com Bubble . Immediately preceding and then during the Global Financial Crisis . The quarter after Covid hit. . Images aren t allowed in this subreddit but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday 09 30 at a P E of 30.07 Historically what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark In all three scenarios by the time we crossed a P E of 30 the dam had already started to break. During the Dot Com bubble the S P 500 was already down 19 from its highs and would fall another 34 before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped it had lost 47 of its value. During the global financial crisis an almost identical story can be told. The S P had lost 18 of its value by time P E broke 30 and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009 it lost 53 of its total value. Covid obviously was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32 and had bounced back in less than 6 months time . Okay so Maybe we have a price to earnings ratio problem but you re still not sold. What else do we have going on Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment and while I could write a diatribe for each for purposes of succinctness I ll simply outline them via bullet points below. Credit card debt is at an all time high and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived has been rising since 2013. Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire it will be the working class most disproportionately affected. Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they ve been since 2011. Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they ve been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they ve been since 2010. The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 Amazon Apple Meta Microsoft Nvidia and Tesla now account for 45 of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30 of the entire stock market combined. As of today they are trading at a combined P E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole. We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs added over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences. Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst some of the largest banks including Bank of America Charles Schwab and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50 of their equity capital. Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks flush with cash took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts these banks will be forced to liquidate said t bills and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously the bank will become insolvent like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. . The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago. Global tensions are high and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe. The US is involved in two proxy wars that don t appear as if they will abate any time soon. The political division in the US is as dramatic as I ve seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here but it seems most are resorting to tribal identity politics split down party lines. Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home and with many offices retaining those practices or allowing partial work from home office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due the owner of that property will refinance the loan restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020 during covid when rates bottomed out are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago and vacancy rates skyrocketing many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117 in March alone. Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 the most recent year I could find data a family earning the median US household income renting a median priced US home was spending 40 of their income on rent. Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves. I believe some of these issues on their own are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together I don t see how we aren t in for a very rude awakening. This economic downturn may be severe. In the three times this has happened before the action or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one the dot com bubble the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies unlike scenario two. During the GFC shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US financial system. While I won t get into partisan politics I m of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary and more importantly for this post the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic. Bailouts on any level whether to companies banks or directly to citizens will inevitably increase inflation. I don t think they are on the table for this correction. People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn t help I think the bigger issue by far was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn t going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing. This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates. What happens from here I don t know. Don t listen to me. I m an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I m probably wrong about 100 of this. The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in that we won t see another ATH for a long time.

2024-10-02,Tesla stock slips after it reports 462 890 total deliveries during the third quarter Tesla s stock slipped 3.5 in premarket trading after the company reported third quarter delivery figures. The EV giant posted 462 890 deliveries and 469 796 vehicles produced slightly below analyst expectations of 463 310 deliveries. While these numbers showed a year over year increase Tesla s growth rate appears to be slowing amidst intensifying competition particularly in China from companies like BYD and Li Auto. In the U.S. Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market but competition is heating up. Rivian and legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors are making strides in the EV space. GM reported a 60 increase in EV sales for the third quarter but with just 32 100 units sold Tesla s lead remains substantial. Tesla s 2024 outlook remains uncertain as executives have signaled a slower delivery growth rate compared to last year. Despite adding the highly anticipated Cybertruck to their lineup the company faces challenges in maintaining momentum particularly as investors focus on profit margins and the potential for further competition in the autonomous vehicle space. Despite these challenges Tesla s stock surged 32 in the third quarter erasing its losses for the year. Investors will be keeping a close eye on the company s upcoming earnings report and marketing event where Tesla is expected to reveal its latest advancements including a potential robotaxi design.

2024-10-02,Tesla stock slips after it reports 462 890 total deliveries during the third quarter Tesla posted its third quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2 in premarket trading after the report. Here are the key numbers Total deliveries Q3 2024 462 890 Total production Q3 2024 469 796 Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463 310 in the period ending Sept. 30 according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount. Deliveries are not defined in Tesla s financial disclosures but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It s one of the most closely watched metrics on Wall Street. In the year ago period Tesla reported 435 059 deliveries and production of 430 488 EVs. Last quarter the company reported 443 956 deliveries and production of 410 831 vehicles. Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure especially in China from companies like BYD and Geely along with a new generation of automakers including Li Auto and Nio. In the U.S. EV competitors like Rivian are maturing while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification. GM this week reported a roughly 60 increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla s with just 32 100 units sold in the latest period accounting for 4.9 of the company s total sales. Ford plans to report results on Wednesday. Tesla hasn t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle the angular stainless steel Cybertruck to their lineup. The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter. Shares of Tesla climbed 32 in the third quarter erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4 in 2024 trailing the Nasdaq which has gained 19 . Tesla s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk who in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump has shared what the White House called racist hate and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X his social media app. But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker with Hyundai a distant second. In its third quarter earnings report later this month investors will be particularly focused on profit margins. Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10 and is expected to show off the design of dedicated robotaxi. Musk has promised Tesla self driving cars for years but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.

2024-10-07,Robotaxis are here and the public is divided. Alphabet owned Waymo is the leader in the space. Tesla s upcoming robotaxi launch. Driverless cars are speeding onto America s streets but whether the public will trust robotaxis remains an open question. Nearly two thirds of Americans said they would not want to ride in a driverless passenger vehicle if they had the opportunity according to a Pew Research Center Survey. That s because residents in cities that have yet to experience robotaxis remain unfamiliar with the technology while those in cities with driverless cabs have not yet forgotten about high profile accidents involving other companies like GM owned Cruise. Now Tesla the loudest and most bullish self driving proponent of them all is due to unveil its long awaited robotaxi after years of unfulfilled promises. The company s existing autonomous driving technology where a human is still at the wheel has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and multiple lawsuits after hundreds of crashes. Experts say a great presentation from CEO Elon Musk won t guarantee a safe robotaxi network. Tesla s upcoming robotaxi launch threatens to throw the whole autonomous vehicle space off course. Alphabet owned Waymo is the leader in the space with the company claiming it has notched more than 22 million driverless miles. It has proven that there is strong consumer demand with weekly paid rides in San Francisco Los Angeles Phoenix and Austin doubling in just a couple months. And Waymo has worked on building its reputation launching an online safety hub with data arguing that its cars are safer than human drivers. Besides Tesla other competitors are also looking to jump into the race. Amazon says it is getting ready to roll out its fleet of Zoox cars and Cruise is resuming operations after a 2023 accident led regulators to ground the fleet. Wall Street is already looking ahead to a driverless future with one analyst arguing that if it hadn t been for generative AI 2024 would have been the year of the robotaxi. As driverless networks scale one of the fiercest debates is whether ride sharing will survive. Robotaxis may cause consumers to question if they really want to book an Uber or Lyft and talk to a stranger sit in someone else s car and tip a human if there is a driverless alternative. Uber has hedged its bets by inking high profile deals with autonomous vehicle companies but it s unclear how long those partnerships will last.,reddit,0.983,0.119,0.065,0.817,0.11180880665779114,0.06415628641843796,0.8240349292755127,positive,neutral

2024-10-08,Do you get the urge to gamble and how you deal with it. So in a few accounts I have accumulated 100k over the years with the usual advise of S P 500 index funds set it and forget. But every few months I get the urge to sell a part of it and gamble in individual stocks. I did that with Tesla in 2018 and that paid off a few others paid off too but then some didn t pay off. Overall am I beating the market I am not sure with rollovers from one job to the next that don t keep track of previous account gains. But I am not loosing either with the strategy. How do you keep this urge itch away Just keeping it in S P 500 is so boring. EDIT based on comments I want to add that I do gamble in casinos table games but not more than $500 $1000 a year. It s fun but I have the thinking that I will loose that 100 . The high from stocks which is 1k 10k gain in a short time is at another level. I don t bet on penny stocks. These are mostly blue chip like when APPLE or AMAZON or CHIPOTLE does down I would buy it and then sell in 1 6 months or just sit on it until it goes up. Sometimes stocks like NEO never go up. I also only SELL options.,reddit,0.8325,0.086,0.06,0.854,0.05087130889296532,0.08895512670278549,0.8601735830307007,positive,neutral

2024-10-11,Tesla shares drop 6 in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company s long awaited robotaxi event where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm s Cybercab self driving concept car failed to impress investors. Tesla stock was down 5.8 as of 6 33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday. Musk revealed Tesla s Cybercab concept vehicle a low silver two seater has no steering wheels or pedals on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches. The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027 but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30 000. He also said he expects Tesla to have unsupervised FSD up and running in Texas and California next year in the company s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD which stands for Full Self Driving is Tesla s premium driver assistance system available today in a supervised version for Tesla electric vehicles. The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel ready to steer or brake at any time. In reaction to the Thursday event analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near term opportunities for Tesla instead prioritizing Musk s vision for a fully autonomous driving future. As expected like prior Tesla product unveils the event was light on the details and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla s growth endeavors in AI AV Barclays U.S. autos mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday. Yet there were no updates indicating near term opportunities. Tesla didn t show its low cost model planned for 1H 25 production they added. We also didn t get any near term updates on FSD progress or data reflecting improvement in the system. Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that most trading oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo taxi unveiling. We wouldn t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks as pre event momentum fizzles the investment bank s analysts said in the note. Morgan Stanley meanwhile suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank s analysts noted that Musk didn t mention any details on improvements to Tesla s FSD system nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie up between Tesla and xAI Musk s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports. The event overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas a lack of data regarding rate of change on FSD tech ride share economics and go to market strategy Morgan Stanley s analysts wrote in a note Friday. We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event they added. It is expected to take some years still before self driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles. Among the few companies that have successfully launched self driving cars on public roads is Google s Waymo which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.,reddit,0.9306,0.097,0.07,0.833,0.017109250649809837,0.9027217030525208,0.08016902953386307,positive,negative

2024-10-11,Tesla is Completely out of Touch with Needs of Taxi Services. Seeing a lot of focus on the Temu Boston Dynamics bot but not a lot of discussion on the robo taxi. How this thing is built tells me how out of touch and unprepared Tesla is to seriously compete in ride servicing. First off this thing has two seats that alone is such a dumb design decision. It had to be Elon that said to keep it as two seats so it looks futuristic and aesthetic. What if I want to travel with a small group of people I m not using the LAX shuttle van at that point I m immediately turning to a competitor. Haven t really seen anyone comment on how out of touch and unnecessary that was. One other concern I have is how Tesla primarily uses cameras. What if there are sirens and a fire truck ambulance or police car is blowing through an intersection. Other autonomous vehicles incorporate sound I m not too sure Tesla does. If not it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. Beyond this there s the ridiculous price tag he put on it which it ll probably be nowhere close to. What are other people s thoughts on this did anything with this Robotaxi actually look like a feasible product to you It looks like an aesthetic toy but not an actual product that can compete in the space. Based on my understanding of a typical car design cycle redesigning this to add four instead of just 2 seats would take probably another 2 4 years at least. To me it seems like they really just showed they lost on their biggest bet in the near future. Edit Alright read through the comments and still think the 2 seat no steering wheel design is stupid. People are saying this is meant to also be a personal commuter car. So my choices are to buy a 30K Robotaxi and then ALSO get a model 3 or model Y to drive around my family for ANOTHER 40K when I can just get ONE model 3 or any other self driving car no Robotaxi and do everything I need How is that budget friendly at all and if there s a nicer car with a steering wheel that self drives why would I buy something without the option of a steering wheel Still a toy. Also if it s for personal use how does this know where to park at my office or how to get past a security gate to private property If I live in a condo building with a garage how does it know how to get out of the parking garage and where my parking space is It makes no sense as a personal car for a LOT of people. And even if the majority of taxi rides are 1 2 people why not just use a model 3 that s 10K more already exists and can service that additional 15 20 of your taxi market . You also save on all the costs that it took to make a stupid 2 seater when it came to expanding production lines capacity testing and designing the pointless thing. My opinion doesn t change this thing shouldn t exist and it s out of touch with what most people need. Total waste of time when they could ve focused on actually competing with growing competition in the normal car space where they re losing their competitive advantage. There s a reason why Uber and the ex Waymo CEO were not impressed.,reddit,-0.9374,0.061,0.081,0.857,0.034642137587070465,0.07976456731557846,0.8855932950973511,negative,neutral

2024-10-11,I m new to Stock Market and I don t understand stock valuations. Hey I m really new to stock market and trading in general. I m mainly a programmer and only a bystander in trading. In 2020 I realized Nvidia was doing really good they also had their investments in a lot of technologies finally start to pay off and even if you exclude the c rypt0 frenzy it was somewhat clear that Nvidia was nourishing. At least to me as a programmer I thought they had a ton of technological dominance and advancements in various areas. And especially in 2022 when AI stuff popped up if it wasn t clear before that with all the research and investments they were doing in AI ML space like it should be clear by that point with image generation LLMs and OpenAI popping off and all of them relying on Nvidia. But the stock price was still at 15 USD at maximum in 2022. At that time I had literally 0 knowledge in the stock market and thought Maybe this is Nvidia s value and this value includes all the new things and market is aware of Nvidia. but in hindsight Nvidia was overly undervalued and the market was simply not aware of it. Maybe it was clear to me because Nvidia is in my domain but am I missing something For example I also get the same vibes with Tesla. Yes it is crazily valued at the moment but still with the event they held yesterday and overall their direction even if everyone hates Elon Musk it also seems clear to me that Tesla will pack a lot more than what it currently is. The robotaxis tesla robot their battery techs their knowledge in vision and ML and a lot more things will start to pay off eventually. After the event I expected today to see a growth in Tesla but it was down by 3 Is everyone waiting a lower point of entry Or are people just not impressed by the event and the promises What am I not understanding and missing here,reddit,0.9618,0.108,0.056,0.836,0.09457168728113174,0.11705441772937775,0.7883738875389099,positive,neutral
2024-10-11,The Dow s Surging 2024 has been a wild ride for the markets. We ve seen tech stocks taking a hit while traditional financial giants like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are soaring. And then today the Dow breaks an all time high shooting up more than 300 points. Big bank earnings are driving this rally but something s been nagging at me. While JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are basking in the spotlight Tesla s been struggling down 8.1 after rolling out their robotaxi. It s got me wondering Is the market getting too hyped on the banks while brushing off some of the underlying risks Sure JPMorgan beat earnings expectations and raised its annual forecast. Wells Fargo Another 5.6 gain. But when you zoom out there s still a lot of uncertainty hanging over the economy. The Fed s potential 25 basis point rate cut in November could be the cushion these banks need but it s not a guaranteed win. Honestly I can t help but wonder am I missing something here The Dow s on a winning streak and major banks are leading the charge. But with mixed inflation data and the tech sector s rocky performance should we be more cautious I d love to hear your thoughts. Are the banks really as bulletproof as they seem right now Or are there risks we re not seeing in this rally,reddit,0.8177,0.122,0.099,0.779,0.04625041037797928,0.8651877045631409,0.08856195211410522,positive,negative

2024-10-12,Ride sharing giants Uber Lyft jump after Tesla s toothless taxi fails to excite investors Tesla s hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber s ride sharing aspirations but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead. Uber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday s event particularly slumping in early August and mid September but surged more than 9 on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52 week high and it was leading the S P 500 higher during the session. That is a massive turnaround for Uber s stock which is now up nearly 22 over the past month and about 38 for the year. Lyft another major player is also surging about 10 on Friday. By comparison Tesla s shares are plunging during Friday s trading session and are down more than 11 this year vastly underperforming both the S P 500 and the Nasdaq which have each gained around 22 so far this year. The buzz around Tesla s highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self driving technology advancements and the company s failure to provide insight on its ride sharing service strategy or economics among other expectations investors had. TSLA s toothless taxi is a best case outcome for UBER Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.

2024-10-15,frontier tech portfolio hey all sharing what i m calling my frontier tech portfolio broken down by percentages. i m looking for valuable input feedback and discussion around it. and if it happens to be helpful to anyone even better. i do want to clarify a few things i m focused on AI bitcoin and space. investment vehicles or not i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise are poised for massive growth and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let s just call this a frontier tech portfolio to give it a name i can reference. i m not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype or you are anti Bitcoin and think it s a ponzi scheme or you think space is a waste of resources or anything along these lines that s ok i respect that perspective but i d like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things and you won t convince me i m simply wrong. i AM looking for feedback on blind spots poor missing assumptions overconfidence things i m not considering or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i m not just looking for people to agree with me i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy. yes i m missing some key areas of what many would call frontier tech biotech green nuclear energy cybersecurity to name a few but i just don t have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i m most confident and able to stay up to date. i m trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who s less familiar with one or any of the spaces categories. my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with strong long term confidence in growth. not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting sexy but that i don t know enough about . i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and or admire. ok with that out of the way let s dive in 30 AI 10 NVDA 5 SOXQ 15 balanced mixed of NOW MSFT AAPL GOOGL META AMZN HIGH LEVEL to me this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI s potential is not chatGPT or smarter versions of it. it s far beyond what we re seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space listen to not what they believe is gonna happen but to what they know is coming because they ve already used the tech usually 1 2 years before the public even sees it these people are overwhelmed amazed terrified enchanted bewildered. to me that s just very interesting. i believe what some others do that we re in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i m not bothered much that AI isn t monetizing in demonstrable repeatable ways. i think there s been and continues to be enough fundamental increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks i ll do a quick dive here. to be clear I don t think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but seems useful to give my favorite things about each 10 NVDA these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it s not just GPU blackwell demand. it s their CUDA programming language and universe and stickiness of it. it s the long term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5 10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it s CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the next big thing. just a lot of confidence here. 5 SOXQ i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it s more diverse and it s got a low expense ratio . i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies . 15 mix of these... NOW excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI driven automation META founder run and with a clear vision demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models meeting consumer needs being pioneers in tech at large AAPL will probably benefit the most from consumer facing AI products and implementation strong leadership AMZN AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries strong leadership MSFT deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365 excellent leadership GOOGL AI pioneer with DeepMind Brain they still own search have enormous amount of data questionable leadership but I m holding for now No TSLA no. i just don t trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company s leadership for me to invest in its stock. there s a big chance i m missing out but I m able to sleep OK with that. i m also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence. 30 Bitcoin 25 Bitcoin itself 5 MSTR HIGH LEVEL why Bitcoin books have been written about it but to shortly summarize my perspective it s quite volatile and risky short term and quite growth oriented and safe long term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology math code based and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that s only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days it s hard to justify NOT putting more into this one but for now i m convinced that diversification is the better long term play. 20 Bitcoin many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT . i do some cold storage and some FBTC . either way just Bitcoin. it s the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high. 5 MSTR this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4 1 BTC MSTR ratio. 30 Space 10 ASTS 10 RKLB 5 LUNR HIGH LEVEL the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that s been talked about for decades and decades. for a while space x really proved this out almost single handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here s why 10 ASTS you should read the kook report for a true deep dive but to hit my high level points they are pre revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5 years ahead of what many think will be a winner takes most race. their partners already include AT T Verizon Vodafone Rakuten American Tower Bell Canada and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky ish play as they have tons to still accomplish but the potential growth is enormous. 10 RKLB effectively a space x competitor on smaller rockets with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom defense and general research spending expands to space economy RKLB is positioned very very well. 5 LUNR i ve spent less time researching them than the other two but my confidence level in the risk reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential good amount of risks ahead. 10 cash ...to buy them juicy dips. ok that s my frontier tech portfolio summary. to repeat this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better than average returns over the next 10 years. i recognize that this discussion didn t even really touch share price EPS P E profitability revenue or other key details. this just isn t the place where i m getting into that. i can say that i m comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth and what companies stocks assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.

2024-10-18,Large cap tech Nvidia and by extension US index funds are likely to crash small cap value international to outperform. Here s why If you look at the story of how the S P500 has performed so well over the past decade the answer is high return on invested capital from tech companies. By hiring top engineers to build innovative products and scaling the product globally these companies to achieved rapid growth at little cost resulting in impressive returns to shareholders. Historically hardware costs were very cheap to scale compared to the revenue it brings in. You could spend a few thousand per month in hosting costs and bring in millions in profits. However this is changing. 7 out of 10 of the top holdings in the S P500 are gambling huge on AI they have laid off tens of thousands of the talented engineers that drove their earnings growth in order to fund expensive acquisitions of AI hardware. Tech can no longer be seen as an industry with low capital costs because AI is tremendously expensive to deploy and maintain. For example Microsoft expects to spend $100 Billion on AI datacenters through Fiscal 2027. That s 40 more than their entire profit in 2023. Because AI hardware is so expensive and the electricity usage is so tremendous these future applications are no longer cheap to deploy and maintain. ChatGPT is perhaps the best example of this. Despite being tremendously successful from a growth perspective it has been tremendously unprofitable from an operating standpoint and relies on continued bailouts from large companies like Microsoft Nvidia and Softbank to stay afloat. The economics of tech companies is quickly changing with companies in an arms race to acquire as many Nvidia chips as possible to build the best GenAI applications they are hurting their margins and operating profitability. The impact of these investments has been quite lousy so far other than some round tripping transactions to create fake revenue and balance sheet growth these ai investments while tremendously expensive have not paid off Microsoft s CoPilot has been a complete failure consumers are not buying CoPilot pcs and the CoPilot app has a 2.3 star rating on the Windows store. They are also facing regulatory pressure in Europe over Recall. Google s AI is providing dangerous and potentially deadly misinformation to users of its search engine such as incorrect advice about prescriptions. Amazon s Go stores were supposed to use ML AI to handle checkouts when in reality the AI failed to handle most of the work and the remainder was just outsourced to human operators in India which struggled to keep up with the workload. Tesla has still failed to implement full self driving and during its robotaxi event had human actors control the robots to fake them being AI controlled. Google s Waymo is very impressive from a technology standpoint but its hardware costs and regulatory barriers make it unlikely to achieve profitability even as it expands. Despite the poor results of AI investments so far all of the top 10 holdings in the S P500 other than Berkshire Hathaway trade at very high P E Ratio suggesting that very high earnings growth is priced in. Even if AI will have a significant impact on the economy and society the economics of it are not favorable to investors due to the high capex costs involved. Tech is no longer an industry where a team of 10 20 engineers can build a product that brings in Billions in revenue with minimal hosting costs. It is now an industry where Billions of capital expenditures are needed just to build a model and margins on the finished product are very poor. Of course tech CEOs realize this which is why Microsoft OpenAI and Google are all working to replace Nvidia hardware which sells at a huge markup with their own in house chips. This is a tremendous threat to Nvidia s long term prospects. Given the high expectations implied by elevated price to earnings ratios and the poor financial performance of AI applications it does seem quite unlikely that large caps will continue to outperform. Small cap value and international stocks are almost certainly a better investment if AI does drive significant productivity improvements then labor heavy businesses will benefit from improved margins from using these products that large tech companies are offering. Looking at small cap value funds like AVUV and international stock indexes there are a tremendous amount of labor intensive businesses with low margins in these funds that would benefit from AI ML. Net margins going from 3 to 10 due to improved productivity would mean earnings more than tripling. This has historically been the case with technical revolutions. For example railroads revolutionized our economy and drove tremendous economic growth but they provided terrible returns to shareholders.,reddit,0.9866,0.11,0.064,0.827,0.0191700030118227,0.9185329675674438,0.0622970387339592,positive,negative

2024-10-21,Thoughts on GOOGLanalysis Why I m ALL IN on GOOGLE. Potential Antitrust Breakup I anticipate an antitrust breakup could unlock even greater value for Google. If this happens owning the company before the breakup means we would receive shares of each separated business unit which will most def drive a higher valuation. Waymo Waymo Waymo Google s self driving division Waymo is making significant strides. They recently announced they will be committing $5 billion to the unit over a multi year period. A . Waymo is already operating in San Francisco Phoenix and soon to be Los Angeles it s safe to say they cracked autonomous driving. B . Critics argue that Tesla can scale better and that Waymo s cars are too expensive. To that I disagree. Even if each Waymo vehicle costs $100k plus another $100k for ALL associated expenses that still buys you 5 000 vehicles if each vehicle completes 15 rides per day that s over 26 million rides annually. C . These rides not only generate revenue but also valuable data for future improvements. D . This creates a significant competitive moat for Google reinforcing its long term dominance. The recognised moat is when the stock soars Isomorphic Labs and AlphaFold 3 Google s business unit Isomorphic Labs and AlphaFold are making rapid breakthroughs in drug discovery and forming partnerships across the pharmaceutical industry. With a potential antitrust breakup this unit could thrive as a standalone company and attract substantial public investment positioning itself as a legitimate pharmaceutical AI powerhouse. Overall AI Expertise While Google s search business is under threat it s important to recognize their AI prowess. Google is integrating AI across all their platforms I think they ll retain a significant share of the search market over the long term. Their AI capabilities are vastly underappreciated. Android Android is an enormous business that could benefit from a spinoff. As a standalone company Android could unlock significant value. I feel it s time to back up the dump truck and LOAD UP.

2024-10-23,Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025 We believe Alphabet is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2 trillion figure now potentially becoming the world s most valuable company by a huge margin as its often overlooked Waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. This would take the stock to over $500 a share. Here s why. Fact Waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10 000 to over 100 000 in the last 12 months. It went from 50 000 weekly rides to 100 000 just in the last six months. The growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive Case in point Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let s let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market that would mean 100 million rides per week. That s about 1 000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride we re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year. But wait there is more to the growth story If Waymo is already delivering over 100 000 driverless rides how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat streaming Netflix while they re stuck behind the wheel. In fact early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85 reduction in injury causing crashes compared to national rates for human operated cars. Investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride hailing market has substantial growth potential it could easily expand by 2 3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn t out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies. But wait aren t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving Yes but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor General Motor s backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self driving space given its large base of vehicles it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month. Waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high resolution cameras LiDAR and radar systems creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don t forget Google s got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base using that to train its machine learning models. That s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments. The best part These are self driving cars no human drivers no unions no employee or contractor issues and no human cost. While there will be other expenses such as software development and battery costs the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50 aren t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride hailing models. If Waymo can capture about one third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50 margin that s a neat $150 billion in profits. What s that worth At a 30x earnings multiple that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently this could take the company s market cap to over $6.5 trillion or over $500 per share. To be sure building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck if you re concerned look even further out say 2035 The bottom line Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly has the technology and competitive edge and is addressing a potentially massive market making this high valuation within reach.

2024-10-23,Tesla shares jump 6 on profit beat Tesla reported third quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations. Here s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG Earnings per share 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected Revenue $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected Revenue increased 8 in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion or 62 cents a share from $1.85 billion or 53 cents s share a year ago. Tesla s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales. Automotive revenue increased 2 to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52 to $2.38 billion while services and other revenue jumped 29 to $2.79 billion. Operating margin was reported at 10.8 of sales to improve from last quarter s mark of 6.3 and top last year s mark of 7.6 . Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8 vs. 17.9 a year ago and 18.0 in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter the EV juggernaut s adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5 of sales from 16.1 a year ago. Tesla had already disclosed 462 890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469 796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3 of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference Tesla delivered 443 956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435 059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla s all time deliveries record was 484 507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles including more affordable models remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025. More than just EVs Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh but were up 75 Y Y. Overall Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. As energy storage products continue to ramp and our vehicle fleet continues to grow we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October. Balance sheet Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter. SUMMARY We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year on year resulting in record third quarter volumes. We also recognized our second highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements. Our cost of goods sold per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at $35 100. In order to continue accelerating the world s transition to sustainable energy we need to make EVs affordable for everyone including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles including more affordable models which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our We Robot event on October 10 we detailed our long term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare personal car ownership and even public transit. The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3. Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.,reddit,0.9962,0.111,0.018,0.871,0.2512904703617096,0.7194439768791199,0.02926553599536419,positive,negative
2024-10-23,Tesla shares jump 10 on profit beat as company benefits from environmental credits Tesla shares jumped 10 following a better than expected third quarter earnings report driven by strong profit margins from environmental credits. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 72 cents surpassing analysts forecasts of 58 cents though revenue slightly missed expectations at $25.18 billion. Automotive revenue rose 2 while energy generation and storage revenue surged 52 showcasing Tesla s growing diversification. A significant contributor to Tesla s profitability came from $739 million in regulatory credits which the company earns for producing only electric vehicles. These credits essentially pure profit helped bolster Tesla s bottom line. Additionally Tesla hit a milestone with 7 million vehicles produced and reported that its Cybertruck achieved a positive gross margin for the first time despite quality challenges. Looking ahead Tesla expects modest growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024 even as it faces increasing competition particularly from Chinese automakers and U.S. legacy brands ramping up their electric vehicle efforts. Some investors are also raising concerns over CEO Elon Musk s political activities questioning how it could influence Tesla s brand and stock performance amidst a highly competitive landscape. Despite these challenges Tesla remains committed to launching more affordable models by 2025.

2024-10-24,Tesla Soars to Best Day in 11 Years After a Blowout Quarter Tesla Inc. s shares surged the most in more than 11 years after the carmaker reported surprisingly strong earnings and forecast as much as 30 growth in vehicle sales next year. Third quarter results were buoyed by Tesla turning a corner with the Cybertruck which generated profit for the first time. Lower material costs an expanding energy business and sales of regulatory credits to automakers that need help complying with emissions limits also contributed to Tesla s best quarterly earnings in more than a year. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk offered an upbeat outlook for 2025 citing the rollout of more affordable models that Tesla has yet to identify. Something like 20 to 30 growth next year is my best guess he said on a webcast. Tesla s shares jumped 22 Thursday in New York the biggest gain since May 2013. That helped add tens of billions of dollars to Musk s net worth and sent the stock into positive territory for the year erasing a slump in the weeks since the CEO unveiled self driving taxi and van prototypes.,reddit,0.9923,0.219,0.01,0.772,0.94630366563797,0.01923924684524536,0.03445715084671974,positive,positive
2024-10-24,Tesla s Not a Car Company Musk s in the Business of Selling the Future. And 5 Other Things to Know Today. It may surprise some to learn that Tesla isn t really in the car business. Sure some 80 of its revenue currently comes from electric vehicles. And CEO Elon Musk is pretty good at squeezing profit out of those cars something many in the industry still haven t managed to figure out. But the most important thing to know about the company is that it trades on more than 70 times forward earnings. Ford and General Motors are on five or six times. This suggests that when investors buy Tesla stock their expectations are in a different universe from when they buy into other car makers. Musk is pulling old school levers to ensure his cars are profitable even as rivals churn out lower cost models. It helps that Tesla can now make more vehicles from the same manufacturing base and squeeze suppliers to cushion margins. At the same time a closer look at the earnings yesterday which beat Wall Street estimates show Tesla s profits come from plenty of other sources. It made money from software from selling regulatory credits for making more than its share of zero emission cars and from battery storage and charging. Of course robotaxis and self driving cars are the next frontier. They re not really cars the robotaxi won t even have a steering wheel or pedals. They are a bet on technology and artificial intelligence not the automotive industry. It s why Tesla is one of Nvidia s best customers. There s a story about Ray Kroc the businessman who made McDonald s the most successful fast food corporation and the value of knowing exactly what business you re really in. For McDonald s it s real estate not hamburgers. Elon Musk knows he s not in the car business. He s selling the future. The tricky part will be delivering on his promises when expectations are already so high.

2024-10-24,Tesla stock has best day in over a decade on Musk s 2025 growth projection Tesla shares soared 22 to close at $260.48 on Thursday the stock s best day since 2013 following the company s better than expected earnings report. The company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion which came in just under analysts expectations of $25.37 billion but was up 8 compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents. We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note. Tesla s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a potentially unsustainable driver of earnings and cash flow. Automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year and if they can t meet the target they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles. Tesla earnings also got a boost from FSD the company s Full Self Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called Actually Smart Summon. CEO Elon Musk said on the call that his best guess is that vehicle growth will reach 20 to 30 next year citing lower cost vehicles and the advent of autonomy. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15 for 2025. Even bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk s forecast and wrote in a note following the earnings report Our view remains more reserved at 10 15 and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30 000 after subsidies and other variants of the small SUV. Analysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock called Musk s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a maybe. They set their estimate at 14 . It clearly depends on the company s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model introduction financing offers and improved features the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday. A grain of salt Musk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time. Bernstein analysts who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla wrote in a note out Thursday The tone of Tesla s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors and was more akin to a pep rally with the company only taking two questions from sell siders. Musk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. The Bernstein analysts wrote We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away. They pointed to Musk s long history of being overly optimistic about FSD and said crowdsourced research that shows Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors on robotaxis. The share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24 gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla s loss for the year and left the stock up 3 in 2024 though it still trails the 22 gain for the Nasdaq.

2024-10-27,Open a second account Not sure If there is a benefit I just hit 100k in my portfolio with 52 in SP500 and now interested in switching to go heavier in dividend stocks. My portfolios other holdings are safe TSLA AMZN MSFT AAPL The two dividend stocks I m holding are monthly paid dividend all reinvested earning me $20 and change a month each and have not lost capital. For some reason my mind is telling me to open a new brokerage account dedicated to only dividend and let my 100k sit dormant is there any upside to this or is the same as putting money in my current account just reallocate the automatic funds from going to VOO into the dividend stocks. Still kind of hesitant to stop investing in the SP all together. I have a ROTH that is maxed out every year and contribute 6 to my 401k with a 4 company match.

2024-10-29,These are the stocks on my watchlist Hi I am an ex prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading I might trade all none of the stocks listed and even stocks not listed I only hold some all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long term. If you use Old Reddit click Show Images at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren t recommendations I m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts. I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting not the business long term prospects or the people involved. PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don t ask about earnings because I typically don t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like Thoughts on or Why isn t on the watchlist or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it I will block you doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I m still long or short a stock beyond what I update. News going to be hands off in this stock unless we go parabolic . Not interested in playing the long and multi day short is extremely dangerous. We finally saw the stock pull back a little from a close to 30 upmove watching $275 level at new highs. Currently short but will likely cover today. Reported better than expected third quarter earnings but missed on revenue. EPS of $1.2 vs $1.07 expected. Revenue of $7.85B vs $7.89B expected. Deteriorating margin missed revenue and guidance all underwhelm. Revenue of $697M vs $623M EPS of $0.05 vs $0.04. Raised guidance and cited members growth. Overall seems like good news but not sure why stock is selling off. Watching at open. Reported quarterly earnings revenue beat but cited fears to ecoli outbreak affecting sales. Said that there might be an effect to Q4 members. Beyond that nothing too interesting in the earnings.

2024-10-31,RDDT pump dump territory I posted about reddit stock a few weeks ago with a general mindset while it was in the 70s its potentially undervalued but since their earnings report 2 days ago this went from 84 to current 120s and rising. While I believe longer term it s possible for them to grow more into the valuation wallstreet is pumping on the ticker it s up 45 in a day and a half. Its the nature of the beast sometimes for a stock to uncontrollably run up. It s rare a stock stays up that high. Only exception to the rule is something like tsla stock.

2024-10-31,$UBER is positioned extremely well for the future At the time of writing this post UBER is down 7 in premarket which is a big overreaction after their earnings report. I suspect the cause of the drop is the miss on Bookings which is not significant in my opinion. Key factors EPS of $1.20 beating expectations of $0.41 Revenue of $11.2B beating expectations of $11B Total Gross Bookings of $41B missing expectations of $43B UBER had a record quarter for the first time it generated an all time high GAAP operating profits of more than $1B. In the conference call the CEO and CFO reiterated that they have a very high standard for doing M A so the Expedia deal is not set in stone rather just a rumor. They ve also stated they are looking to reduce share count in 2025 meaning doing share buybacks which will in turn drive higher share price. But what I want to talk mostly about is the AV section. AV The AV is a hot topic right now especially after Teslas event. Despite Tesla being clearly very far behind actual FSD Waymo is doing AV and doing it good. They are partenered with UBER and the AV fleet actually had the highest rated score on the platform . Beside Waymo they are partenered with 14 AV companies including Aurora which they also have a big stake in. AV is coming maybe not now maybe not next year but it is inevitably coming. And all these AV especially the smaller ones need a platform to operate their fleet. Do you build it from the ground up or join UBER who has 25 million rides a day already They are also partnered with BYD for the electrification of their fleet. Guess what is BYD also working on Yeah thats right AVs. And judging BYD China success on doing EVs I think thats a pretty good chance they will also succeed on the AV side. And since they are already partenered where do you think BYDs AV fleet will be used In UBER. I think the company is positioned greatly for the future its profitable after multiple years of negative EPS it has a clear plan moving forward about their free cash flow including reducing $2B out of their debt by the end of the year. Disclaimer I do have a position in UBER. $UBER,reddit,0.9817,0.114,0.058,0.828,0.4682995080947876,0.06644850224256516,0.46525195240974426,positive,positive

2024-11-01,BlackRock launches ETF that expands beyond the Magnificent Seven BlackRock s iShares is trying to appeal to investors who want to diversify beyond from the so called Magnificent Seven. The firm launched the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF this month. It doesn t just hold the Magnificent Seven Apple Amazon Meta Alphabet Microsoft Nvidia and Tesla. It s made up of the 20 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization. What the iShares build ETFs are designed to do is to deliver a tool kit of simple solutions for investors to be able to capture the growth of some of the largest companies within the U.S. equity market today but to do so in a broader and more diversified manner BlackRock s Rachel Aguirre told CNBC s ETF Edge on Monday. Aguirre the firm s head of U.S. iShares product noted the ETF s mission is to deliver an easy and accessible way to tap into the innovation of megacaps whether that be in the tech heavy Nasdaq space or more broadly within the S P . The ETF according to Aguirre provides a way for investors worried about the concentration of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the S P 500. On Thursday the Magnificent Seven slid more than 3.5 as a group losing around $615 billion in market cap. That s equivalent to the size of JPMorgan Chase. However the Magnificent Seven is still up about 43 so far year while the S P 500 is up around 20 It s important for clients and investors to remember that there are split views on this topic. There are many investors who believe that the big will get bigger that the winners will continue to win Aguirre said. There s also another side to this argument. There are many investors who believe that it s actually a very worrisome time to continue investing in mega cap companies because of just their high valuations.,reddit,0.9862,0.139,0.038,0.822,0.2165977656841278,0.0337468683719635,0.7496554255485535,positive,neutral

2024-11-01,Need help regarding intrinsic value So the stock in question is Tesla. I have done lots of research into the company and it s finances and have used multiple methods in order to determine an intrinsic value to find a nice entry price. The methods I have used are 1 Discounted cash flow 2 Multiples valuation model 3 Graham s valuation model This is not to say that my valuations are correct by any means and I accept there could be faults in my calculations. My concern is that Grahams valuation model has produced the highest IV by some margin. However it seems quite reasonable given how Tesla stock has traded over the last few years that this could be fairly accurate. I just want some advice on how people would use these numbers. Would you A Use grahams alone as a benchmark for IV B Try and find an average between all 3 models and use that as an IV value but at the risk that the stock may never drop as low as this so I may miss out on the stock altogether Edit Please offer your advice I am trying my best to learn and would be handy to see what other people do in this situation,reddit,0.9273,0.114,0.037,0.849,0.0658753514289856,0.07828018069267273,0.8558444976806641,positive,neutral

If it s b that s even worse coz one s judgment must not be clouded as Graham and Warren have though themselves big decisions must be logical not ruled by vibes and emotions. Thank you.

2024-11-05,Musk now says it s pointless to build a $25 000 Tesla for human drivers So will there be any new car model for Tesla in 2025 Musk now says it s pointless to build a $25 000 Tesla for human drivers When Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long promised next generation $25 000 electric vehicle the automaker s stock plunged. Chief Executive Elon Musk rushed to respond on X his social media network. Reuters is lying he posted without elaborating. Tesla s stock recovered some of its losses. Six months later Musk appears to have backed into an admission that Tesla dropped its plans for a human driven $25 000 car. He said in an Oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable EV would be pointless unless the car was fully autonomous. His latest remarks came in response to an investor asking When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25 000 non robotaxi regular car model Musk responded We re not making a non robo before he was interrupted by another Tesla executive. Musk later added Basically I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly. The April 5 Reuters article reported that Tesla had abandoned plans for an all new affordable mass market EV but still planned a self driving robotaxi. Since then Musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles. Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story. On the October earnings call Musk said that Tesla does plan a $25K car its Cybercab a two door two seat fully autonomous vehicle. Musk unveiled a prototype at a Hollywood style event on Oct. 10. Musk says Tesla will start production of the Cybercab in 2026 after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California next year. The automaker faces steep technological regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on Musk s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles which echo others dating back about a decade. An all new affordable Tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of Tesla s strategy to become the world s biggest automaker. For several years Tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030 more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of Toyota the current global sales leader. In May Tesla dropped the 20 million goal from its latest impact report on progress toward sustainability goals. As recently as January of this year Musk confirmed the plan for an all new affordable EV in an earnings call. He said the next generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major growth wave following the first wave with the release of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in 2017 and 2020 respectively. Investors and Tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a Model 2 slotting in below the Model 3 currently the least expensive Tesla starting at $42 490. In January Musk described the all new model as requiring new revolutionary manufacturing technology. But in April after Reuters reported Tesla had scrapped the Model 2 Musk outlined a plan for more affordable models that could be produced on the same manufacturing lines as current Teslas. Seth Goldstein a Morningstar Research Services analyst said he believes these less expensive vehicles will be built on current Tesla platforms and priced in the mid $30 000s. It was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more affordable vehicle on a new platform he told Reuters. I think Tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their Chinese EV peers So they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle. After the April 5 Reuters report that Tesla had killed the Model 2 Musk posted that day on X saying Tesla planned a robotaxi unveil in August. The event delayed until October and held on a movie set near Los Angeles underwhelmed Wall Street and drove a 9 drop in Tesla shares the following day. Some investors viewed Musk s comments on the Cybercab along with displays of an autonomous Robovan concept and humanoid robots as short on concrete details about the products. Tesla hasn t said whether the Cybercab will feature new self driving technology beyond the company s Full Self Driving feature in its current vehicles. Its existing models can t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention. The target market for the Cybercab isn t clear. The Cybercab s sports car looks and two door two seat configuration a nearly extinct layout in the wider U.S. auto market puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage. Musk in the October earnings call said the concept vehicle s design was optimized for autonomy and would also deliver affordability. It will cost roughly 25K so it is a 25K car Musk said. It just won t have a steering wheel and pedals.,reddit,0.952,0.044,0.025,0.931,0.03823559731245041,0.637489914894104,0.324274480342865,positive,negative

Being the single largest donor to Trump s campaign is working out for Elon . What surprised me though is seeing other stocks like Coca Cola and some REITs reacting negatively dropping by about 4 . It makes me wonder why certain sectors seem to be moving in the opposite direction. It looks like today s heatmap is showing a clear trend sectors like consumer non durables and health tech took a noticeable hit while finance and tech stocks are up. Interesting to see how varied the reactions are across sectors maybe it s tied to post election sentiments or a shift in investor focus Anyone else noticing similar patterns in their portfolio Heatmap by sector Happy post election day to everyone.,reddit,0.9764,0.159,0.008,0.834,0.24086174368858337,0.15602479875087738,0.6031134128570557,positive,neutral

2024-11-06,Trump Election How to Play Stocks to be bullish on during a Trump term Oil $XOP $XOM $SHEL $MRO C $COIN $MARA $WULF Big Bois Apple $MSFT $NVDA $AMZN etc Military $BA $LMT $RTX Prison CoreCivic Sectors to be bearish on during a Trump term All renewable energy Agriculture immigrants make up significant amount of labor for the sector International shipping tariffs and isolationist policy would be bad Auto manufacturing parts coming from overseas will have tariffs Low cost foreign retail like Shein and Temu equivalents will get hit hard by tariffs Increased Volatility Awaiting Action Cannabis Republicans have historically been tough on marijuana. It seemed like things would be par for the course once again until Trump said on Truth Social that he would be voting in favor of Amendment 3 in Florida which would make it completely legal for adults 21 and up. I suspect this was a grift but he s such a wildcard that maybe he really would go against the conservative grain. $APPL While I left it out of the Big Bois due to the China taxes being a bearish variable I think it should still hold strong in the long term. We ll see $TSM probably has the widest range of outcomes in the market imo. If Trump s attitude toward China is legit Best Pro $TSM sees increased demand from U.S. and allies who want to bypass China s questionable supply chain. Worst Con $TSM still makes most of their money from China who could retaliate in a number of ways Least worst con $TSM is still intertwined with China s cheaper supply chain. A western supply chain would be more expensive and be time consuming to adopt. Don t even want to consider it possible but anything less diplomatic than economic warfare with China would be drastic not only for $TSM but for the people of Taiwan god forbid. $DJT $TSLA boy oh boy Ironically both of these companies are suffering from the same problem and are presenting the same solution. Problem half decent product lacking a reliable consumer base Solution present people with a charismatic rich guy in hopes they will buy use the product off of pure Ethos alone. Neither of these share prices move on fundamentals but there will come a day when the market finally recognizes them as a social media app and car company respectively.

2024-11-06,Why Donald Trump s Return Could Boost Demand for Robots A Long Term Investment Opportunity Hey everyone With Donald Trump making a return I think there s more to consider than just the political drama. Specifically his policies could have a huge ripple effect on the labor market especially in the service industry. Trump s stance on illegal immigration means we could see a stronger push to reduce undocumented workers which would lead to an even bigger labor shortage in industries like hospitality food service and logistics. If fewer workers are available companies will likely have to fill that gap and robots could be the answer. That s where robotics companies come in especially ones like Tesla Richtech Robotics and Serve Robotics. Tesla is aiming to make waves with its humanoid robots while Serve Robotics focuses on last mile delivery solutions in urban areas. But let s talk about Richtech Robotics in particular because they ve already got robots deployed and working in real world environments addressing exactly the kind of labor shortages we re talking about. RR s service robots are already in use across various industries from restaurants to healthcare facilities and they re receiving high praise from clients for their reliability and efficiency. Their tech isn t just conceptual it s been tested and proven which gives them a solid foothold as demand grows. And then there s Elon Musk himself. If he ends up being involved in government restructuring it wouldn t be surprising to see him push for more automation within federal jobs too given his passion for robotics and AI. If Musk advocates for more robots in both private and public sectors we could see a huge surge in the robotics industry overall. Sure the attention is still on DJT stocks and virtual currency as short term plays riding the Trump wave but I see robotics as a sector with way more potential for sustainable growth. For those of us looking for long term positions robots could be the steady play we re after especially as the tech gets better and companies like RR SERV continue proving their value in real world applications. Anyone else seeing this as a big moment to get into robotics stocks for the long haul,reddit,0.9922,0.131,0.02,0.849,0.31461870670318604,0.02526042051613331,0.6601207852363586,positive,neutral

Questions like Thoughts on or Why isn t on the watchlist or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it I will block you doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I m still long or short a stock beyond what I update. News Overall watching the same stocks as yesterday. Currently short but watching for some kind of bounce today Watching $300 level and $290 level. Short biased but no position in this it s possible we ll make another leg up in this. Reported earnings in line with expectation shares dropped mainly due to no raised guidance. EPS of $0.30 vs $0.26 Revenue of $855M vs $808M. News from last week auditor resigns. Fears of this being delisted and upcoming earnings are leading to big selloff lowest it s been in the past few months. Missed their earnings report two days ago... so likely going to be delisted. Short report by Hindenburg 3 days ago another massive selloff. Just watching at the moment no bias. Another insane selloff yesterday with no bounce at all. Interested in this as a longer term investment Pres will likely fire Lina Khan which will stop the FTC case against GOOG. Currently long.

2024-11-07,What s the take on AAPL s future given Trump victory Tariffs and Elon gaining more power What do you think will happen to AAPL I have a high exposure to AAPL and it has served me well. With Apple Intelligence and general trend in tech stocks with AI boost I still saw some upside and was thinking of holding for longer. But now what Trump won and tariffs are coming I see Apple products becoming more expensive and taking a hit in sales in the US. Also I feel Elon has had a tiff with Apple in the past with them pulling ads from Twitter X Elon trying to launch Tesla Phone and some history with Apple refusing to buy Tesla since Elon had put some shitty condition like he wants to be CEO of Apple as part of the deal. Do you think Apple will likely see more downside with this Administration or will it likely be more or less the same fate as rest of the Tech stocks Is Trump Victory ultimately agnostic to Apple s future,reddit,0.3095,0.079,0.058,0.863,0.08023562282323837,0.1656901091337204,0.7540742754936218,positive,neutral

2024-11-08,MBLY is the next Trump Elon stock. 10 bagger MBLY is the leader in autonomous driving technology supplying automakers. Elon will push Trump to encourage the expansion of autonomous driving for his Tesla Full Self Driving and robotaxis. Only three companies can do full autonomous driving Tesla Google s Waymo and Mobileye. Automakers will have to respond and they aren t going to use Tesla or Waymo since those are competitive threats. The only viable solution will be MBLY. MBLY already announced Volkswagen as their first main autonomous driving win. At their upcoming Dec 9th analyst day we may get more announcements. A year from now all of the big 10 automakers will have a plan for autonomous driving and most of them likely select MBLY. Each customer like Volkswagen is $3b revenue a year . MBLY s current revenue is $2b. So by 2028 MBLY s revenue could be $15b vs $2b today. Meanwhile the stock is on lows due to near term noise around weak total auto units industry wide etc creating a great entry point. $MBLY is my next 10 bagger. In 2027 the stock will be $170. $MBLY,reddit,0.9081,0.095,0.036,0.869,0.05284922942519188,0.09215205907821655,0.8549987077713013,positive,neutral

Such as Apple S P 500 EFT Tesla Nasdaq 100 EFF Meta and others. This compares to NVDA s 4.2 weighting in the average retail portfolio a year ago NVDA s popularity is largely due to its rapidly rising stock price earnings reports that have repeatedly beaten expectations and retail investors preference for tech stocks over the past year NVDA s stock price has risen 203 and in the second quarter NVDA s revenues of $30 billion were up 15 sequentially and 122 year on year well above the $28 billion estimate,reddit,0.8176,0.077,0.019,0.903,0.956721305847168,0.015351991169154644,0.027926722541451454,positive,positive

2024-11-11,Flexing gains from holding positions through the election is kinda disingenuous Been seeing some furus and redditors here and there boasting about their gains on tsla crypto and the like. Am I feeling fomo that I didn t dip my toe in Can t deny I am. But imo gains made from holding positions through the election are no different from a jackpot payout especially for trump adjacent stuff like crypto and tsla. Stop acting like its the result of some superior TA and or flow reading etc. when the election was an earnings level news event across the entire market. and to everyone else please don t get taken in by those huge gain numbers it could have easily gone the other way the whole thing was a coin flip.,reddit,0.9777,0.218,0.046,0.736,0.06467705219984055,0.1342138946056366,0.8011090159416199,positive,neutral

In this case however we can notice a pattern of bag holders who have FOMO d into something they ve wanted to sell for a quick buck and then had to bear the pain sometimes for years. A good deal of those sold at a loss at some point but TSLA s Market Cap is still made up in some part of people in the red. These people have been waiting to cash in for years and at this point they re not gonna sell unless it at least hits a historic high. So I do believe that a price of $400 is at least for now an important support level for this stock and if I know the dude bro culture that is largely responsible of this rally I d actually say $420 is an ever more reasonable price within the next 2 months.,reddit,0.1965,0.093,0.081,0.826,0.08309128880500793,0.14006145298480988,0.776847243309021,positive,neutral
2024-11-11,Last week s high volume stocks TSLA Tesla saw massive move to the up and it has now gone in over extended territory. Do not chase and wait for it to dip to support level at 271.28 BAC Crossed over resistance of 44.26 and retested that level. It should keep going higher under lower interest rate environment. My immediate target is at 47.24 MSFT Good stock to go stay longs. Unlike many other stocks that s hitting ATH MSFT still hasn t flown away to hit the ATH. It s not the question IF the question is WHEN. Immediate resistance is at 438 439. UPST Upstart had great earnings and the stock went up by 24 in a day after earnings. The next immediate resistance is sitting between 86 95 META Meta is going in a range at this point. The support is sitting at 558 569 and price coming to that area will be nicely bought. INTC Intel had nice weekly bullish candle. There are few pivot levels 24.71 23.56 22.12. My immediate target is at 27.86 where it can face some resistance. AAPL Apple has been going in a range. We need to look for a breakout down. A close below 213 is a breakdown whereas close above 238 in daily chart will be a breakout. AMZN Amazon had a breakout above 200. Will it retest or continue going higher My target to above sits at 214 for now. AMD Lot of people are looking at AMD. It had a bullish last week but I believe it still has some more room below before rallying. SOFI Nice weekly breakout. Do not chase and wait for retest. The key level to retest is at 11 12 range. NVDA Three weeks ago Nvidia had weekly breakout and then it retested those levels before continuation to the upside last week. I had given target of $154 last month and I believe it will hit that target.,reddit,0.9136,0.057,0.01,0.933,0.13280977308750153,0.056743793189525604,0.8104464411735535,positive,neutral

2024-11-11,Elon Musk s Trump bet has paid off so well that Tesla is now worth more than most of the rest of the car industry combined Tesla CEO Elon Musk s all in gamble to get Donald Trump elected president has proven so successful that a veritable chasm has opened up between his EV manufacturer and the rest of the auto industry. As conventional carmakers trade at rock bottom prices amid a broad industry malaise brought on by China s economic slowdown and growing fears of Trump tariffs Tesla s stock continues to soar creating one of the biggest valuation gaps it s ever seen. On Friday Tesla reclaimed its place in the elite club of companies worth more than $1 trillion after adding a full third in market capitalization since Election Day less than a week ago. The last time Tesla was worth this amount of money it was April 2022 Musk had just revealed his $44 billion plan to acquire Twitter. Relative to its peers Tesla is now worth more than the next 15 largest carmakers combined from Toyota and General Motors all the way down to Jeep s parent company Stellantis and Hyundai. Toss in lower ranked names like Kia and Renault respectively worth $26.6 billion and $12.6 billion and Tesla is still is still ahead only drawing even once the $8.8 billion from Japan s Nissan is thrown into the mix.,reddit,0.9137,0.101,0.036,0.863,0.22732935845851898,0.4012692868709564,0.37140142917633057,positive,negative

2024-11-12,Hertz Share Price Close To Half Book Value After Hitting an Expensive Undo Button Hertz made a big bet when it bought a ton of Tesla EVs for its fleet. The bet has not paid off in the slightest with higher maintenance costs than expected an overstock of the EVs and lower than expected resale value. This decision has put the company in a hole where it s now trading at close to half of its book value.

2024-11-13,Options been hitting MGM ZIM ALB F SPY TSLA Few others just started oct 9th I made my 1st call options after 6 years of investing long term I was deeply terrified of options bc it was an unknown to me now I m not scared anymore I understand it at least buying Calls. It is evident that many individuals face similar challenges in trading investing and options each with their own specific strategies and approaches. Personally I have experienced significant success in investing achieving returns of over 100 on a few occasions though this was limited to four or five instances. Conversely I have incurred losses exceeding $2 300 in Minute Trading with ES Futures SPY Minis. Due to my struggles with futures trading I have decided to refrain from it as I found myself lacking the necessary patience. The financial stakes involved such as $12.50 per tick and $125 per handle were daunting and I felt that the micro contracts did not align with my trading style. I was inclined to treat the ES as a gamble rather than a trade as the potential profit of $25 to $50 on significant moves did not seem worthwhile. Currently I have recently ventured into options trading having started on October 2 2024. Although my experience in this area is limited I am optimistic about my progress thus far. I recognize that this positive trend may not be sustainable but I remain hopeful. My journey in trading began in 2019 starting with a $300 course. If anyone has questions or requires assistance I am available to help. While I do not intend to share my specific trades I am more than willing to provide guidance to newcomers or anyone seeking answers.,reddit,0.8997,0.084,0.042,0.874,0.11426786333322525,0.1185329258441925,0.7671991586685181,positive,neutral

2024-11-13,RKLB I ve been buying RKLB since it was worth around 11 dollars. I currently have around 500 dollars of RKLB and 600 dollars of VOO in my portfolio. Is it worth getting RKLB and selling VOO I believe RKLB has loads of potential and that the stock will shoot up as soon as they get a successful Neutron launch out of the way. Also despite what some are fearing I doubt Elon would interfere in RKLB s business. Neutron is not a F9 competitor for now and until they can get their cadence up it won t even be. A Trump presidency does not seem like that much of a risk. Especially with Elon fighting for things like deregulation which will help everyone including RKLB. I do understand going all in on a single company stock like RKLB is very risky but if things do pan out this will be like buying Tesla in the early 2010s. Space is the new market and RKLB is right behind SpaceX in it. I m 15 so I have a long investment horizon.,reddit,0.6016,0.084,0.063,0.853,0.13619984686374664,0.024603569880127907,0.8391965627670288,positive,neutral

2024-11-15,It s 287 a reasonable stop loss for TSLA I bought 3 stocks of TSLA at 330 knowing that I was willing to lose up to 130 ish dollars and wanted to make 130 ish dollars. The reason being I m moving to Japan on December 29th and was considering travelling somewhere for two days for New Year s and maybe being frugal with my cash and choice of hotel or something. My logic being if I don t make bank on this bet I ll just celebrate in Tokyo and save 140 dollars on stupid expenses no big deal. The recent announcement to cut EV incentives scared me and I set a stop loss at 287. However I ve got a bit of FOMO knowing it could bounce back after that. But my intuition says it s more likely to crash if it reaches that point. I could also just sell now and take the losses fuck it.

2024-11-18,Trump Team Is Seeking to Ease US Rules for Self Driving Cars TSLA 5 overnight due to this news. Members of President elect Donald Trump s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department s priorities according to people familiar with the matter. If new rules enable cars without human controls that would directly benefit Elon Musk the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president elect s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self driving technology and artificial intelligence. Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self driving vehicles according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they weren t authorized to speak publicly. While the Transportation Department through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs two of the people said. One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump s team and potential staffers they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined they said. Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department the people said. The transition team didn t respond to requests for comment. Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk s plans for the so called Cybercab including a cap limiting their deployment. He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla s third quarter earnings call saying he d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc. Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to dismantle government bureaucracy and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome. Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled. NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2 500 self driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100 000 have repeatedly failed. A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump s first term but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class action cases.,reddit,0.8201,0.062,0.027,0.911,0.0768878161907196,0.08141659945249557,0.8416956067085266,positive,neutral

If you use Old Reddit click Show Images at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren t recommendations I m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts. I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting not the business long term prospects or the people involved. PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don t ask about earnings because I typically don t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like Thoughts on or Why isn t on the watchlist or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it I will block you doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I m still long or short a stock beyond what I update. Today looks to be the day that the market experiences some minor pullback. Largely watching the same momentum stocks I have for the past few days. News Pres 47 wants to relax self driving rules in the US shares popped decently on the news. Watching $350 level again. CEO Chris Wright was picked as energy secretary. Small bounce from the short seller report last week CEO Execs plan to buy $3M in stock after rejecting false claims. Though this would typically signal bullishness I d still be careful of this stock. supposedly due to NVDA Blackwell AI chips overheating in servers.

2024-11-19,Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power multiples and enterprise value Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price as well as their current earnings multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone s risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir. So here s something you may have read somewhere Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy . Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o business segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth increasing margins and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that for the right price you want to be a part of. Key phrase for the right price . I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir s stock is. For starters let s take into consideration palantir s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50 versus its 2021 peak Palantir s enterprise value has ballooned much more. 2021 peak enterprise value $60B at around $37 per share 17 11 2024 enterprise value $146B at around $64 per share This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020 Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following. End of 2020 $1.12 2021 $0.80 2022 $0.92 2 023 $1.04 LTM $1.19 Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue per share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived growth stock. Yes revenue is increasing but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth. Likewise their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture you better believe Karp co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new lots of companies do this. But consider this. In their last blowout quarter Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income or about 1 1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number $52M or more than one third was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual non adjusted no nonsense operating income. Furthermore they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV sales. This means that if all of Palantir s revenue was after tax profits and paid out as dividends it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13 . That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require A incredible and sustained growth in revenue B a steadily increasing margin and C an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time We all remember Stock McNealy s iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble At 10 times revenues to give you a 10 year payback I have to pay you 100 of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses which is really hard with 39 000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R D for the next 10 years I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now having done that would any of you like to buy my stock at $64 Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are You don t need any transparency. You don t need any footnotes. What were you thinking This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember you still need upside It s not just about justifying the current stock price it s about penciling out enough upside in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. On friday the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11 and with this move added another five years of revenue to its elephant sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear their current EV EBITDA is nearly 400x . The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is Why Based on what Sure it shoots up 5 a day and this leads everyone to believe it s an amazing company. But long term this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40 annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels there is only one way this ride will end. As it stands now all of palantir s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share all of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1 3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom level valuation I do not know what is. If you currently buy a 10 year bond you will net roughly 4.5 in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1 8 in revenue All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus I am short for now using graniteshares 3x Palantir . The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus I will look to acquire long dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more but that s what makes a market. Happy investing,reddit,0.9997,0.172,0.033,0.795,0.2988346815109253,0.023106280714273453,0.6780590415000916,positive,neutral

2024-11-20,$RIVN Riding to Valhalla Alright degenerates. Rivian isn t just the dorky little brother of Tesla anymore it s the ex nerd who s going to show up at the 10 year reunion ripped and in a tux ready to steal the prom queen. This play has all the makings of a 10x banger if you re willing to hold on like your life depends on it. Buckle up because this ride is going 0 to 69 faster than you can swipe right. Why Rivian Is About to Deliver Tesla s Fumbling the Ball Elon s gone off the deep end and is alienating the very crowd that made EVs sexy to begin with. Progressive elites Millennials The kinds of people who buy organic kale and want their car to save the planet Yeah they re turning the corner to RIVN who s out here whispering sweet nothings about sustainability inclusivity and not being a hot mess. Basically Tesla s stuck doing the walk of shame while Rivian s already at brunch ordering mimosas. How Rivian Could Ride Trump s EV Rollercoaster You d think Trump and EVs go together like oil and water but here s the twist RIVN could totally benefit from his likely America First policies. With Rivian s production fully based in the U.S. any federal push for domestic manufacturing would be a tailwind. Meanwhile Trump s cozy relationship with Elon might have TSLA in the spotlight but every infrastructure boost for Tesla chargers indirectly benefits RIVN since its vehicles now play nice with Tesla s Supercharger network. Most any other policy that benefits TSLA will help RIVN as well. Rivian s set to snag the benefits without the baggage making it the sneaky winner here. Everyone s FOMOing into TSLA right now but RIVN is the sleeper play here and it s only a matter of time until the market realizes this. New Models That ll Make You Feel Things Let s talk about Rivian s R2 SUV and its new lineup. Starting at $45K it s the hot but affordable option that s ready to steal hearts . Tri motor setup Level 3 autonomy Integration with Tesla s Supercharger network That s not just sexy that s full blown EV porn. This isn t a one night stand Rivian s building long term market appeal. And if that $45k price tag isn t inclusive enough for you Wendy s employees they re adding a cheaper R3 model just for you . Efficiency More Bang for Their Buck Sure Rivian s been burning through cash faster than you can dump your paycheck into hookers and blow but they ve learned to keep it tight. Cutting the Georgia plant saved $2.25B and now they ve found exactly what they need to hold them over until their new models roll out. That s efficiency baby. Analysts Are Hot for RIVN Some of the suits on Wall Street are swooning over Rivian. Their buy rating and price target of $15.67 give it a potential upside of 54 . They re hyped about Rivian s leaner operations aggressive production targets and a fat pipeline of new EVs. But there are still plenty of doubters who like losing money means the minute this stock turns around the squeeze will make it run. RIVN shot from current levels all the way to $18 when the VW news first dropped plus the recent pop to $12 when VW upped their commitment from $5B to $5.8B but they re now being valued the same as they were before the deal existed. People who think a cash injection of half the company s market cap isn t going to move the needle are delusional. Not to mention they have $6.73B cash on hand and they re only valued at $10B Seems like a steal to me. The Risks Dilution Rivian s diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R D and scaling production which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW s cash infusion and affordable models on the horizon they might not need to rely on dilution going forward. Cash Burn Rivian s like the guy spending money he doesn t have to impress his date. Sure it s a gamble but if those new models hit like I think they will it s a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House do you honestly think he s going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that s all he talks about Hell no he ll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off. TL DR RIVN isn t just another EV play it s the EV play for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman and Rivian s lineup of models hotter than a summer fling the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50 upside with room to double. This stock s the real deal and I m strapping in for the ride.

2024-11-21,2 month rollercoaster 2k 55k 25k 125k After not trading for a 2 years to save up for a house I started back up again in October with 2k. Hit a few runners with SOFI and Tesla earnings and got cocky with a weekly straddle on McDs earnings which wiped me out. So like the degenerate I am I pulled almost 60k from my EF and proceeded to lose about half from google and apple until apple finally had a good day. The last 2 weeks I have come back with my biggest winners being Disney Walmart and Snow. Outside of Walmart I only played straddles with the last few being 12 20 expiries.

Additionally they have a which includes a $500M aircraft order. Their order book has now reached $6B with actual orders and deposits. The most compelling aspect is that they have $500M cash on hand. They are burning far less capital than their competitors. With a big auto partnership upcoming FAA approval global expansion and a first mover advantage in a trillion dollar market this is not some penny stock moonshot. They are positioned as the next Tesla of the skies. The infrastructure is ready regulations are green lit and wealthy individuals are eager for flying taxis. The numbers speak for themselves.

2024-11-23,I started this year with $15k lost it all mid year during the great bull run and eventually built it back up to $60k through LEAPS. After depositing $15k I set a goal to invest in value stocks and grow my portfolio by 20 annually managing it myself by picking individual stocks. I started by buying 10 stocks including Celsius Tesla Arm Ferrari and others. My portfolio grew to $18k. From there it fluctuated and at the time I knew nothing about options. Eventually I decided to throw it all into one name when I saw its price spiking. My account hit $30k for the first time. However I still hadn t learned to take profits and was stuck in a scarcity mindset feeling like I had to ride every trade to the max. After watching my portfolio tank back to $12k I started revenge trading to recover losses but ended up nearly losing everything. That experience pushed me to learn about options including the Greeks implied volatility and moneyness. I then switched strategies deciding to buy longer dated options with strikes that were somewhat ITM. I focused on companies that were promising for the near to long term and had been beaten down. Instead of buying high and selling low I started buying stocks at cheaper prices and simply waiting. Over time my account began growing steadily as I stuck to my strategy and waited for my take profit targets to be hit. I traded into hyped small caps before eventually selling all my positions to go all in on quantum. Now I m holding cash after finally taking profits for the first time.,reddit,0.2742,0.082,0.075,0.843,0.08568470180034637,0.14317241311073303,0.7711428999900818,positive,neutral

2024-11-23,In my late 20 s is there not value in investing in VT for 90 of my portfolio and then taking 10 of my portfolio and putting like 3.3 into stocks with potential to 10x or greater like tesla BTC and ETH If in 10 years even one of these goes 10x and all the other ones go to zero bankrupt then I would have tripled the 10 investment.

2024-11-24,Newcomer stock mobile app advice Hello I m considering taking 5k from my 401k so I can play with the stocks a bit myself. Not much experience made some $ years back on the weed stocks. The stocks I was considering are GE Nvidia Google and Tesla. Was going to maybe evenly contribute amongst these stocks. Any words of advice or stocks I should include avoid Short term return also applicable would consider selling and banking profits and leaving the initial 5k in the market. One more thing a good app for stock trading I ve used Robinhood a bit and love the layout. I ve had fidelity before it just wasn t as simplified. I don t like Robinhood because the stuff they pulled during AMC GME and I turned stock lending on with the accidental click of a button. Not something I d like to have investments in.

2024-11-25,Clawed my way out of the hole Finally back in the green over all time Made a bad call back in March holding onto what seemed like a pretty safe call debit spread on SMCI . Long story short SMCI closed right at the short leg strike point so whoever was holding onto the 10 contracts I was short on decided not to exercise leaving me long on 1000 very pricey and very volatile shares of SMCI. Ended up getting margin called that weekend and losing almost 11k when markets opened that Monday Proceeded to make a series of bad panic option trades on NVDA and Adobe over the following months trying to recoup my losses dropping me further into the red. Was down about 18k at the beginning of September Finally had a stroke of luck with a well played call spread on MSI then rode the election wave up to the green over the past few weeks.

2024-11-26,California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits governor s office says Tesla s electric vehicles likely would not qualify for California s new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if President elect Donald Trump scraps the federal tax credit for EV purchases Governor Gavin Newsom s office said on Monday. Tesla shares closed down 4 . Trump s transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7 500 for EV purchases Reuters reported this month. Tesla CEO Elon Musk a close Trump adviser sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California This is insane. Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs oil and gas. Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit he will propose creating a new version of the state s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594 000 vehicles. The governor s proposal for ZEV rebates and any potential market cap is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition innovation and to support new market entrants the office said. California provided up to $7 500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug in hybrid battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state s cap and trade program. Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla s Fremont factory during the pandemic and California s approval of a bill on transgender kids. In 2021 Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit. California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero emission vehicles doubling total sales since 2022. Last month a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state s plan to halt the sale of gasoline only vehicles by 2035 a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism. California s rules which have been adopted by a dozen other states require 80 of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20 plug in hybrid electric.

2024-11-26,Rivian Receives Conditional Commitment for up to $6.6 Billion Loan from the U.S. Department of Energy RVINE Calif. November 26 2024 American all electric automaker Rivian Automotive today announced it has received conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion to accelerate its growth and leadership of electric vehicle design development and manufacturing in the United States. If finalized the loan would support the construction of Rivian s next facility in Stanton Springs North near the city of Social Circle Georgia substantially expanding the company s domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets. This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company s midsize platform which underpins the R2 a midsize SUV and the R3 R3X a midsize crossover. Designed engineered and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability function performance and pricing Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company s long term growth and profitability. The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry. Rivian intends to build the facility in two phases each resulting in 200 000 units of annual production capacity for a total of 400 000 units of annual capacity supporting the sale of American EVs in international markets. Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. Rivian is expected to create approximately 7 500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company s future manufacturing facility in Georgia. This is in addition to 2 000 expected full time construction jobs that will utilize the region s significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem. These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal Illinois which have bolstered the local and regional economy. This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in EV manufacturing and technology said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability. A robust ecosystem of U.S. companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the U.S. to maintain its long term leadership in transportation. Rivian plans to design and build a fully modern manufacturing facility at the Stanton Springs Site less than one hour s drive from downtown Atlanta employing modern construction techniques and advanced environmental management while preserving natural spaces and investing actively in the surrounding communities. Over the history of the loan program DOE has helped energize American EV manufacturing with billions in financing for this strategically important industry including loans to General Motors and Tesla. While this conditional commitment indicates DOE s intent to finance the project DOE and the company must satisfy certain technical legal environmental and financial conditions before the Department of Energy enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan. If finalized the loan would be secured by all assets of the project and fixed assets and guarantees of the parent company Rivian Automotive Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.

2024-11-27,The Fruitcake Portfolio Greetings my friends and prepare yourselves. Join me as we learn the wey of gey. What you see before your very eyes is an experimental portfolio I have made. No real money is involved but essentially this is a watchlist on E Trade with share quantities assigned to each stock to fit my hypothetical allocations. The purpose of this portfolio gey. By tilting heavily to the gey factor we hope to realize the rawdog premium. The core of this portfolio is Grindr . It holds a 27 allocation . The path of gey is risky but potentially rewarding. Grindr holds what many consider to be somewhat of a monopoly on the LGBTQ dating and hookup market. Only the individual who achieves great wealth from Grindr stock can become a true Lord of the Gey. The other stocks that makeup The Fruitcake Portfolio are stocks that one might consider to be gey in some wey. In reality this means we must invest in stocks typically designated women stocks. Now personally I love stocks of companies whose target audience is women. Just because the product isn t some sci fi tech robot A.I. missile etc etc doesn t mean that it isn t a good company with amazing potential. I personally already own ELF and in my real accounts. However in this portfolio beauty cosmetics and baby household care products make up around 26 in total . Hims Hers was selected for it s exposure to the men s sexual health market. They got ED pills condoms lube prostate massagers cock rings etc. With the addition of a 10 HIMS allocation The Fruitcake Portfolio will be on all fours back arched with its cheeks up in the air for exposure to the chode of this lucrative industry. In addition to HIMS there is also a small 2 allocation to Church Dwight because they make Trojan condoms. FBTC is the Fidelity BitCoin ETF. This is the only crypto play in the portfolio and makes up 10 of the portfolio. If Warren Buffet has Coca Cola then The Fruitcake Portfolio has Starbucks because Starbucks is zesty and therefore perfectly suited as those who regularly drink from Starbucks follow the wey of gey. Similarly Cheesecake Factory is more of a growthy value stability stock in the restaurant sector. I wanted to originally find a vegan or vegetarian stock however those tend to fail. However CAKE actually has been expanding its business lately with the restaurant Flower Child. Flower Child serves vegan vegetarian paleo dishes and more. So yes CAKE is a bit of a compromise pick but I think it fulfills the requirement of gey. There is an 11 allocation split between Victoria s Secret Lululemon and Nike . Overall this is more of a value play and a smaller weight. VSCO is the primary holding here. Disney and Netflix are tiny allocations to streaming services. Need I explain why they are perfect for The Fruitcake Portfolio If you are a 35 year old male millennial and you still visit Mickey Mouse every year and take pictures with Cinderella then you are no novice to the wey of gey. Finally we have a tiny 1 allocation to Google . Literally the alphabet company. Something interesting to note is that this portfolio actually tilts very heavily into midcaps. Once ELF becomes a large cap then things will be more balanced. I ve considered adding a SCV as well. For stocks and ETFS that didn t make the cut I had TSLA FSLR The wey of gey is partial to EVs and clean energy. VEGN Basically a cruelty free S P 500. Considered including this and removing a bunch of the large cap stocks in the portfolio. An OTC Malaysian stock that I could probably buy through interactive broker. It s particularly NSFW. Weed Stocks. TGT Target is Target. BBWI Bath and Bodyworks for scented candles and slippery bathtub moments with bubbles . RVLV Clothing Retailer. If anyone has any ideas of how they might improve this portfolio feel free to let me know. Any interesting stocks that you think might fit well in the mix Would you swap out anything I plan to track this portfolio s performance. I m thinking I ll actually buy Grindr shares next week.,reddit,0.9988,0.154,0.025,0.821,0.056550733745098114,0.018681174144148827,0.9247680306434631,positive,neutral
2024-11-27,These are the stocks on my watchlist Hi I am an ex prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading I might trade all none of the stocks listed and even stocks not listed I only hold some all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long term. If you use Old Reddit click Show Images at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren t recommendations I m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts. I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting not the business long term prospects or the people involved. PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don t ask about earnings because I typically don t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like Thoughts on or Why isn t on the watchlist or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it I will block you doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I m still long or short a stock beyond what I update. Happy Thanksgiving everyone. Will not be posting on Friday due to the half day. Mainly earnings today.

2024-11-27,Why $SPY is the Real Thanksgiving Turkey Alright degenerates gather round the table because I ve cooked up some sweet Thanksgiving DD and no it s not cranberry sauce . Here s the deal Thanksgiving isn t just about stuffing your face and awkwardly dodging Aunt Karen s questions about why you re still single it s also PRIME TIME for unsolicited stock and crypto pitches at family dinners. And that my friends is why Black Friday is not just for TVs at 80 off but also for stupidly green markets. Here s how it works 1. Family Financial Influencers Grandpa brings up how he s still holding Exxon since the 80s your cousin Chad flexes his crypto portfolio and your tech savvy niece just learned about AI stocks and is suddenly Jim Cramer. Everyone at the table is buzzing with hot picks while passing the mashed potatoes. This is not financial advice but it kinda is. 2. The FOMO Catalyst Uncle Bob hears about some stock with a weird ticker and thinks Why the hell am I not in this By the time the pumpkin pie rolls around he s downloading Robinhood. Multiply Uncle Bobs across America and boom retail frenzy ensues Friday morning. 3. Markets are Closed Thursday This is key. People have 24 whole hours to stew in their newfound knowledge . By the time the market opens Friday all that pent up Thanksgiving YOLO energy explodes into buying pressure. Everyone s a financial genius after 3 glasses of wine and a turkey coma. 4. Black Friday Greenery You know how everyone shops like maniacs on Black Friday Stocks are no different. This is the stock market doorbuster effect. Everyone s piling into stocks like they re $5 air fryers. And best of all it s also the gateway to the Santa Claus rally. As Christmas shopping kicks off so might the stock market s annual tradition of going full holiday cheer mode. It s like the market whispering You ve been good this year here s a little green to celebrate. My Prediction for Friday $SPY opens green Like your drunk uncle s karaoke rendition of Sweet Caroline it s inevitable. Tech stocks Probably up because Aunt Susan heard about AI once on The Today Show and now thinks it s the key to immortality . Crypto Let s be real Cousin Chad is hyping Bitcoin like he s got Satoshi on speed dial. It s probably gonna pump harder than Grandma s blood pressure when she finds out you brought store bought pie. Random meme stocks Oh yeah because someone s cousin brought up that one company with the short interest that shall not be mentioned. ACHR $ACHR will be taking a flight this Friday WSB s favorite bird is ready to soar and you degenerates are gonna love it. TL DR Thanksgiving isn t just about turkey it s a breeding ground for half baked stock ideas. When Friday rolls around we re gonna see a tsunami of retail money hit the markets. $SPY gonna pop and we ll all be riding the gravy train. To the moon or the Wendy s dumpster GODSPEED Disclaimer This is absolutely NOT financial advice just a turkey fueled theory for entertainment purposes only. If it somehow works consider sharing some pumpkin pie and maybe a thank you card.

2024-11-28,Where are future returns even supposed to come from Happy thanksgiving to all of you I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment so let s discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. First there s the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML s. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I m not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. But digging a bit deeper the bubble doesn t remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren t 2021 style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10 year yields close to 4.5 I mean I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It s a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3 operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5 . What is supposed to happen here Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10 yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never even in my fever dreams would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right. But multiples are arguably way ahead of themselves. Current CAPE ratio has only been higher during two times in history 1929 and the dotcom bubble. This is kind of a clich but at the same time owning these stocks nets you nearly nothing. So what s the game here Are people betting that Costco will trade at 80x earnings next year Everything I know as a value investor tells me that this must end and that it is time to hedge. But at the same time anyone who has shorted this ridiculous market has been ground to a pulp by the onslaught of endless liquidity that s pouring into the market. So what do you guys think Are the U.S. stock markets about to pull a Nikkei and leave us all grinding our teeth until 2040 before a new high will be set Hope that turkey tastes well by the way.,reddit,0.9942,0.104,0.028,0.868,0.07776820659637451,0.07678551226854324,0.8454463481903076,positive,neutral

2024-11-29,Thesis A Food for Though on Fundamentals of TSLA in Relationship to the Era When Warren Buffet Was Born Hi investing friends granted calculations say TSLA is overbought by around 7 to 8x but if we go back in time and imagine it s today could TSLA be at an era when it was good for Warren to buy Wrigley s stocks or Coca Cola stocks I get Buffett s picks which are first en masse second they are consumables 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster 4th don t require R and D at some point I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable it doesn t have to stop with one person it can go on to almost forever with the next generations. Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it it s en masse everybody needs to commute driving s one s self is convenient it s consumable in a way coz you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually and there s always new graduates to buy them 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it s as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there s not much further R and D .

2024-11-29,Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving My dad is an active investor has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn t know that I thought was common knowledge but I m curious how common it actually is or if it s a generational gap. The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing other stuff but through no effort on their own the other stuff is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their AI hardware is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers to Pixar etc. not similar they are literally the same thing. They didn t somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that s better than everybody else s they ve been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it s so hard for a competitor to overtake them they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow really expensive and really difficult. This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex Nvidia current Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they re only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally. As to why Nvidia and not AMD it s largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA cuDNN etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10 years ago so now it s what everybody builds on. Before all the arm chair experts come out of the woodwork yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they ve been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use cases and they re not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards. I don t mean to discount their good work they ve done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck. tl dr the energy it takes to train ChatGPT could fry 100 000 turkeys this year,reddit,0.9938,0.104,0.02,0.876,0.04435523599386215,0.06377030909061432,0.8918744325637817,positive,neutral
2024-11-29,the TRUTH about investing no one tells you 1. The system is rigged The financial industry thrives on overcomplicating things to justify fees. As Charlie Munger said The whole damn system is corrupt... everyone wants easy money fast. And that requires a big fee. Think about it there s $2 trillion locked in mutual funds charging 2 fees while underperforming cheap index funds like the S P 500. Who s really winning here Hint it s not us. 2. Temperament beats intelligence Investing isn t about being the smartest it s about controlling your emotions. Warren Buffett The most important quality is temperament not intellect. I read a study of a fund that averaged an 18 annual return but the average investor in that fund lost money because they tried to time the market. Lesson Fear and greed will destroy your portfolio faster than any bad stock pick. 3. The S P 500 is your cheat code Here s your free investing hack buy the S P 500 and chill. Low fees. Decades of growth. Outperforms 98 of funds consistently. Even Charlie Munger admits Wealth managers have almost zero chance of beating an unmanaged index like the S P. So why do people chase stock picking glory Because too many investors confuse excitement with success. 4. Picking stocks is really hard Think it s easy to find the next Tesla It s not. And even if you do good luck getting in before the hype. Buffett If you can t value the stock you can t invest in it. You can gamble on it but you can t invest. Most people buying stocks have never even read a balance sheet. Picking winners is possible but it s incredibly hard think Charlie Munger level hard. What this all means The truth is the game is rigged for most people to lose. But that doesn t mean you can t win.The winners aren t the ones chasing hype stocks or flexing their 10 baggers they re the ones quietly compounding wealth by staying disciplined and focusing on what works consistency patience and a solid strategy.

2024-11-29,Finally Hit $100k in Robinhood After Years of Grind First post ever on Reddit albeit a long one so buckle up fellow degens Been lurking for 6 years finally made a new Reddit account to share this milestone. Started this journey back in 2017 in Robinhood rode the highs and lows and at one point even saw my portfolio drop to just $1K back in July 2022 . But here we are in 2024 looking at $110k and up $47k all time The Ups and Downs Looking back it s been one heck of a rollercoaster. As you can see in my all time chart there were some major dips along the way. The journey wasn t linear there were times when I felt like the portfolio was just bleeding out but I stuck with it made some strategic moves and kept adding funds whenever possible. After starting with the modest account balance of about roughly 18k back in Q4 2017 I steadily added funds to my portfolio over time especially after seeing triple digit returns in NVDA SQ and double digit gains in bunch of blue chip stocks held some Chinese stocks like Luckin Coffee . Got the account to a decent level. Then went completely regard and got into options . Did well initially then hit the rock bottom reaching as low as $998 . Added about 9 12k over next few months to be able to trade again. No options but used margin money to almost double my account first. Then as the bull market kicked in after bottoming out in October 2023 the account continued to rise. Later I employed slightly more aggressive options strategies to reach my current position. Key Moves The past 18 months have been all about researching a shit ton and making mostly informed decisions mixing with some gut feeling using Reddit stocktwits yahoo finance various research firms reports interviews Fidelity CNBC etc Current Portfolio includes PLTR bunch of Semi stocks including NVDA TSM. Blue Chips Growth stocks like SOFI SQ ETFs and a few dividend yield stocks like QQQ IJH XLE JPEQ etc. Credit Put Spreads LEAPS CSPs and CCs PLTR and semi stocks plus bluechi Missed out on a 10x gain on NVDA funny enough never went long on TSLA or got into some of the group s fav stonks from back in 2020 21 but holding PLTR since 2020 has been solid. I also hold stuff long term on other platforms Fidelity and Webull including most of my PLTR shares.

2024-12-01,Thoughts on Tesla in December So right after Tesla recently reached it s ath I made the decision to short it and I made some decent returns on that but already closed the position as Ibfelt like it was done with it s current correction. But I still think the company is very overvalued. I would think 250 is a fair value or maybe even less. Let s be honest the overvaluation is due to people having strong feeling for Elon Musk not bcs the company has an economic moat. So the question we need to ask ourselves is will the postive sentiment end at any point in the near future and honestly I do not think so. Bunch of recent tweets were pretty controversial and all that but I feel like this won t have any further impact atm. I just read they are recently started production on the newest Y model and it s supposed to be available in early 2025 so this might actually push the price up until then. But I really feel like it is so risky to invest in the stock. Maybe a smal call option just to not miss out but also keep liquidity,reddit,0.9905,0.187,0.022,0.79,0.11026790738105774,0.1098395362496376,0.7798925042152405,positive,neutral
2024-12-01,A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry Hi investment friends starting with the point of this analysis Tesla is a Wrigley s or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. Warren Buffett s although we love him he s one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto invest in things you understand but there s still that constant that he s not infallible. What it means to understand has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before. As most have said in the tech industry sir Warren s fundamental which includes that it s highly speculative analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz it s most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company it s not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative . Tesla is not just a car company it s more than that its an energy company it s an A.I. company solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w Elon s leadership there s a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere .

2024-12-01,difference between splitting large companies by FTC DoJ and collaborating companies Not sure is this is just obvious and a stupid question. But my confusion arises from the recent demand to split Google . I understand this antitrust cases keep happening like i think it happened to Microsoft some years ago. But can t google sell its parts to a friend and still have continued access to whatever is needed. For example Musk seems to use X data to train models of xAI even if they are separate companies or uses Tesla employees to fix X stuff or spaceX stuff it doesn t seem like the government stops companies from collaborating.

If you use Old Reddit click Show Images at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren t recommendations I m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts. I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting not the business long term prospects or the people involved. PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don t ask about earnings because I typically don t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like Thoughts on or Why isn t on the watchlist or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion.

2024-12-02,Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses bid to get $56 billion pay package reinstated A Delaware judge ruled on Monday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $56 billion compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it.The ruling by the judge Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it surprising investors and cast uncertainty over Musk s future at the world s most valuable carmaker. Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk the company s driving force who is responsible for many of its advances and reinstate his compensation.McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case $345 million well short of the billions they initially requested.

2024-12-03,Investment Advice Rebalancing I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan. I m a fairly recent immigrant to this country so started my retirement savings from scratch in my early 30 s. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast making around 100 150k year running my own business as an S corp where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60 of my income which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business. My main expense is rent and utilities other than that I have no other debt aside from small credit card bills Current Accounts and Savings Personal Checking Account $3k keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account salary in bills out. Business Checking Account $20k this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow I usually try to keep it around $20k thinking I could should move at least 50 into an account that accrues some interest. SEP IRA 25k I max out the contribution yearly 25 of my w2 income I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That s it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum ROTH IRA 18k Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI VOO and 10 cash. M1 Investment Account $3k started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR TSLA NVDA AMZN AAPL V LLY etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out. Regular Brokerage Account $1.5k use this for the occasional weekly monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400 500 per month from this account so most months i don t even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account. Chase Investment Account $14k $400 monthly contribtions this was a Chase Auto Invest account that yielded about 10 so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80 invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market i m thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline. Crypto $20k been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy. So my currently contributions to all my accounts are SEP IRA 1k monthly DCA into VTI ROTH IRA $500 monthly DCA into VTI VOO M1 $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks Chase Invest $400 monthly DCA into money market Crypto $400 DCA into BTC I don t really ever sell stocks or funds unless they become seriously overweight or I need the cash which hasn t happened so far. I m fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don t worry too much about market movements I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. TLDR Please critique my current investment strategy are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys DCA contributions more effectively,reddit,0.9613,0.054,0.025,0.922,0.028741884976625443,0.07247813045978546,0.8987799286842346,positive,neutral

2024-12-04,NVIDIA s share price surge and the outlook for the AI arithmetic market bubble risk and rational layout of industry giants As NVIDIA s share price has risen sharply in the short term many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants GPUs as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips are currently far from meeting demand. We can assume that AI applications are still only in their infancy and there has not yet been a particularly prominent Al burst application in the world. Analyse the results The AI market is still at an early stage AI applications despite explosive growth in recent years are still at an early stage. The arithmetic power required for current AI applications especially GPUs is still in the pre burst stage. The growth of Tesla and the robotics industry for example predicts that billions of robots will be needed in the future for arithmetic support. This means that there is a huge potential for growth in AI arithmetic demand over the next few years especially in inferential computing. GPUs as core hardware for AI GPUs play a key role in AI inference computing especially in tasks that require high parallel processing power . Although there are already many GPU products on the market overall the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand especially in the reasoning segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation especially in the field of automated driving cloud computing and so on. Personal view NVIDIA s leadership in the GPU space is well recognised but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short term surge in its share price. NVIDIA s dominant position Currently NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations especially playing a central role in large scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA s rising share price reflects investors optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market. Bubble Risk As NVIDIA s share price has surged the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA s high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors could change the market landscape. Therefore investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short term speculation. Core view US tech giants are supportive of NVIDIA s technology but they will also support NVIDIA s competitors such as AMD in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry. Analyse the results Rational rather than short term profit driven the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market. If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure it could lead to overpricing affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result companies such as Google Microsoft and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD. In summary future outlook and risks Huge potential for AI arithmetic The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling especially in the area of inferential computing and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving. NVIDIA s dominance and risks While NVIDIA s dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition especially the rise of competitors such as AMD may affect NVIDIA s market share. Long term layout of industry giants U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic they will not simply pursue short term benefits but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years. The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential but is still in the early stages of development. While NVIDIA occupies a leading position in the AI hardware market its high valuation and share price volatility also make the risk of a bubble,reddit,0.9974,0.127,0.047,0.827,0.09030313789844513,0.4502476751804352,0.45944926142692566,positive,neutral

2024-12-05,KULR is the Future Strategic Bitcoin Play Could Make This Penny Stock a Multi Bagger Alright r pennystocks let s get serious for a second. I know we all love a good moonshot but hear me out on why $KULR isn t just another penny stock it s a sleeping giant. So KULR just announced they re taking their excess treasury cash and putting it into Bitcoin. Naturally people are out here talking trash saying things like Speculative penny stock dipping into another speculative asset Big risk To that I say Exactly. This isn t a reckless gamble it s a brilliant strategy for exponential growth. Here s why 1 BTC as a Strategic Reserve We ve already seen big players like MicroStrategy and Tesla add Bitcoin to their treasuries. Why Because it s an asymmetric bet on long term value. For a company like $KULR with cutting edge tech in thermal energy management and battery safety this move signals they re not just trying to survive they re playing offense. 2 Insane Risk Reward Let s be real we re not buying penny stocks for their blue chip stability. We re here for moonshots. The combo of KULR s strong business fundamentals and a BTC kicker could supercharge the stock. The downside is limited but the upside A potential market cap of $5B or more. That s a minimum target IMO. 3 Ignore the Haters People whining about speculation need to get a grip. KULR s tech is already in high demand they re working with NASA the military and EV manufacturers. Adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet doesn t weaken their core it adds a high risk high reward asset to amplify shareholder returns. 4 Perfect Timing With Bitcoin showing signs of another bull cycle this move could significantly increase their liquidity. Think of Bitcoin as the ultimate asymmetric hedge it s speculative sure but the rewards FAR outweigh the risks for a growth stage company like KULR. In summary This isn t some pump and dump vaporware. KULR has legit tech real clients and a bold strategy to maximize growth. The Bitcoin play is a cherry on top a calculated move to leverage speculative growth alongside their core business. Risk is the name of the game with penny stocks and this one is worth it. My price target $10 short term $30 long term. If their Bitcoin gamble pays off this stock could go parabolic. Don t miss the boat. Thoughts Critics Let s discuss. EDIT Holy shit look at the numbers 71.8K views in just 6 hours and 6.6K in the past hour alone Clearly this is catching fire and for good reason. KULR s decision to allocate up to 90 of their cash reserves into Bitcoin isn t just a bold move it s a game changer. Not many companies especially at this level are thinking like this. While others are playing it safe and hoarding cash KULR is taking a strategic risk to position themselves as a forward thinking innovator. This isn t just about Bitcoin it s about showing they re willing to think outside the box and embrace growth opportunities that most companies are too hesitant to touch. This level of attention proves people are starting to recognize the significance of this move. Whether you re bullish or skeptical you can t deny that KULR is making waves. Huge moves like this don t happen every day in penny stocks. Keep watching this could be the start of something massive. $KULR $KULR,reddit,0.9968,0.197,0.103,0.7,0.11251432448625565,0.02035747468471527,0.8671282529830933,positive,neutral

2024-12-05,Waymo to expand to Miami aims to launch robotaxi service there in 2026 Waymo is setting its sights on its next location the Sunshine State. The Alphabet owned company announced Thursday that it will be hitting the roads in Miami. Waymo said it will first begin cruising through the Florida city with human safety drivers in 2025 before opening doors to riders for its robotaxi service through its Waymo One app in 2026. The expansion into Miami is indicative of Waymo s growing confidence in operating its self driving vehicles in harsher weather conditions in large metropolitan areas in the U.S. Waymo first tested in Miami in 2019 which the company said helped improve the ability of its self driving vehicles to navigate in wet and rainy conditions. We deepened our learning and understanding of the Waymo Driver s performance in adverse weather conditions a company spokesperson said. Waymo will use what it learned when it returns to the city with its all electric Jaguar I PACEs next year. The company said its initial territory in Florida will include some parts of Miami s larger metropolitan area which has a population of more than 6 million people. Waymo has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding. In November the company announced it was removing its waitlist of about 300 000 people in Los Angeles so anyone would be able to use Waymo One to hail a self driving robotaxi throughout the nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County. The company s ride hailing service also operates citywide in Phoenix and San Francisco. And in September Waymo announced a partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta. Through that deal Uber riders will be able to access Waymo s robotaxis through the Uber app starting in early 2025 and Uber will be responsible for fleet management and operations of the Waymo vehicles including maintenance and infrastructure such as vehicle charging cleaning and repairs. Additionally Waymo on Thursday announced that it will partner with mobility company Moove to manage its fleet operations facilities and charging infrastructure in both Miami and Phoenix. Moove will begin managing Waymo s Phoenix fleet in early 2025 a Waymo spokesperson said. Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture s parent company Alphabet which also owns Google led the funding round alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz Fidelity Perry Creek Silver Lake Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price. The robotaxi company said it now sees more than 150 000 paid rides per week via the Waymo One app across San Francisco Phoenix and Los Angeles. Waymo is the only autonomous vehicle developer that currently operates a commercial robotaxi service in several major metro areas across the U.S. but competitors are looming. GM owned Cruise is working on bringing its autonomous vehicles back into use on public roads after discontinuing its services following an accident where one of its self driving cars injured a pedestrian in San Francisco. Tesla meanwhile showed off design concepts for a self driving Cybercab and Robovan at an event in October. However Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self Driving software in its vehicles as partially automated driving systems which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self driving ride hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025. SoftBank funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco and Amazon owned Zoox is also testing its self driving cars which do not feature steering wheels in several U.S. cities.

2024-12-06,What is your thought on my portfolio and strategy I m 30M. I recently started investing in ETF individual stocks. Below is my portfolio I figured it out myself but I am not sure if it is reasonable in the long run and I want to hear other people s opinions comments and criticism on it. I put in a lump sum and plan to DCA monthly. ETF 75 iShares Core MSCI World IWDA Individual stocks 25 Tech Growth 12 Microsoft Google Apple Amazon Palantir Nvidia Tesla dividend 5 Siemens Merck Co Swiss Re Exxon Mobil McDonald Consumer defensive 3 UnitedHealth Mastercard Cola Personal favorite 3.5 Garmin Air Product and Chemicals Walmart Rolls Royce Airbus Aerospace Defensive 1.5 Rocket Lab Howmet RTX Corp The reason that my portfolio contains more than 20 stocks is that I want to diversify it in terms of the stocks not types of assets. My concerns questions are 1. I m not sure if I hold too many stocks in the same category and most of them are already covered by the IWDA ETF. 2. I m also considering holding only 1 or 2 high dividend stocks like AbbVie instead of 5 dividend stocks. Is it a good idea 3. My long term plan follows time in the market timing the market . So I plan to split DCA in half and put in ETF and stocks equally. I also read about the Statistically is the Enhanced DCA worth a try All suggestions are welcome.

2024-12-08,Shorting Tesla Tesla went up almost 50 after Trump won elections. Although they are friends Trump might revoke the EV tax credits. And if not Tesla will most likely be excluded from California s EV tax credits which is the inspiration for 12 other states that may or may not follow California s example. Further Tesla is becoming less of an exclusive brand and revenue is mainly from more discounted cars. Of course Tesla is more than just the cars but it is their core business.. Do you think lower revenue might tank the stock or will it still be interesting due to the different other businesses or that Elon Musk as a CEO is already enough to keep investors in.,reddit,0.8117,0.122,0.035,0.843,0.0983337014913559,0.05823608115315437,0.8434301614761353,positive,neutral
2024-12-08,I m bullish on Rivian and here is why. Currently holding 65 shares looking to round that out to 100 next pay period. I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. I am simply sharing my thoughts. These are the things I will be watching this year to continue to add to my position or to see if I should reconsider my bullish sentiment. 1. Nearing profitability. Rivian has recently re affirmed that by Q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. They are expected to deliver just over 50 000 vehicles for the year. That is a combination of mostly R1S and R1T with some of the Amazon delivery vans. If there guidance is correct and they either meet or beat q4 24 earnings it is a bullish sign. 2. $6 Billion loan from Uncle Sam. Now the new administration does create a bit of tension here. The new DOGE agency is going to be cutting Gov. spending across the board. There is some concern they will take away this loan that the Biden administration had given to Rivian. While this is certainly a possibility I do not think it is going to happen. I think it would be a very bad look politically and would give strength to the argument musk will us his Gov. connections to attack his competitors. Because of that I think this money is safely staying with Rivian. If it turns out DOGE is going to back down from this threat that is another bullish sign. 3. VW Rivian joint venture. VW NA is about to change they are getting a new CEO Kjell Gruner who previously was the President and CEO of Porsche Cars of North America and then moved to Rivian to be there Chief Commercial Officer President Business Growth . VW desperatley needs software expertise and Rivian delivers that in spades. That combined with VWs massive buying and production power is a strong match. This is a bullish sign right now and what I think has been pushing to stock upwards. VW has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits. The introduction of the old new Scout brand that looks mighty similar to Rivians R2 concepts. As well as confirming the deal with Rivian it looks like they re finally going to start to take serious steps to rebuilding their reputation especially in NA. 4. Rivians customers are happy and according to a recent Consumer Reports Survey 86 of owners say they would buy a Rivian again better than Tesla. If they are happy with their purchase they will talk to their other wealthy friends about their Rivian word of mouth is very powerful. 5. The inevitable Tesla Comparison. RIVIAN IS NOT TESLA. Now obviously Tesla the company in 2024 is very different to Tesla the company in 2015. Back in 2015 it was the 3rd year of Model S production and the first of Model X. in 2015 Tesla sold just over 50 000 Model S. Now in 2023 just two years after the Rivian R1T debuted Rivian sold just over 47 000 vehicles. I think Tesla in 2015 is more of a fair comparison to Rivian now in 2024 but Tesla now in 2024 is not so comparable to Rivian now in 2024. I think Rivian makes a fantastic product and there s a bright future ahead for them.,reddit,0.9699,0.077,0.033,0.891,0.4657421112060547,0.04339824244379997,0.49085965752601624,positive,neutral

2024-12-09,$GOOG the BFTG Regards grab your tendies and gather around the fire because I m going to tell you all about $GOOG the BFTG . I ll break it down for you because I know you polish that real nice so I can t expect a single wrinkle. 1. Criminally Low P E Ratio While all your other tech darlings are flexing P E ratios like a hooker in heat $GOOGL is at 23.4 P E ratio. For reference $SPX 27 P E $MSFT 36 P E $AAPL 39 P E $NVDA 56 P E $AMZN 47 P E $TSLA 106 P E Remember a good P E ratio is traditionally around 20 25. If you don t understand then read a fucking book. 2. AI Incumming Sure everyone s talking about OpenAI and ChatGPT but who s making real money here Google owns 90 of search traffic and monetizes it like a legal cartel. Once Gemini gets some improvements and a little lipstick even MORE money. Oh and don t forget Google Cloud which grew revenues 30 YoY last quarter. 3. Santa Rally Ho Ho Hold Onto Your Bollocks Historically December is green season for big cap tech. Funds rebalance and retail apes are YOLOing. The Santa Rally isn t just a meme it s a statistical goldmine. With $GOOG s recent earnings beat the market s about to price this in as snow starts falling. 4. Big Tech Safe Haven Recession Inflation Global chaos Who cares. Big Tech don t give a FUCK . Ad spending may wobble but companies will NEVER stop buying Google ads. 5. Buybacks on Steroids $GOOGL has a $70 BILLION buyback program active the best part They re buying low and will push us even higher. TL DR Google Is The Perfect Combo of Value Growth.

2024-12-09,Quantum Computing Inc is going to crash Context Quantum computing is having its moment. It s risky but could massively disrupt industries in areas like computing finance and cyber security. But stock market bubbles are forming. Quantum computing is probably the most technically difficult industry for analysts to assess. Few people are equipped with an adequate understanding of quantum technologies which is leading to massive mispricing. Quantum Computing Inc is junk Iceberg Research s recent short report covers some of them. They note that the firm has run from one fad to another and failed at each. They list several misleading claims that they ve made and withdrawn. The report is damning and raises serious questions about the future of the company I encourage you all to read it. However Iceberg does not go far enough. They lack talent. Successful quantum innovations requires strong technical knowledge that you really can only come by in either leading universities or megacap firms like google. I went through the Linkedin profiles of each of their employees and compared them with their small cap competitors. I tallied up the share of employees that went to an Edu Rank top 100 world universities for Quantum Physics they rank incredibly poorly among it s peers less than a fifth of employees . This is robust to different ranking metrics. Counting only Ivy leagues they come out much worse. But look not all employees are on linkedin. And this is the next big underdog No. A large share of their talent comes from the Steven s Institute of Technology an unremarkable university in New Jersey The company s Chief Quantum Officer is Yuping Huang. On first glance he appears to have a prolific publishing history however most papers receive low citations and or he is third fourth or fifth author. Huang was previously sued by shareholders for breaching fiduciary duties when he merged his previous company with Quantum Computing Inc. Notably he is both a director and employee which is a big corporate governance redflag . There is only one independent director with a background in Quantum Physics to provide checks and balance on Huang Dr Javad Shabani. He is not up to the task. His publishing history is mediocre. Looking deeper the Chief Technology Officer Yong Meng Sua has an even more mediocre publishing history. And has only risen to an Assistant Professor role at Steven s. He spends much of his time discussing esoteric computing questions tangential to his work And finally the Director of the Company s chip foundry . Dr Milan Begliarbekov after finishing high school enrolled in a bachelor s degree in English literature at Steven s graduated then immediately enrolled in a physics Phd at Steven s. Either he is a savant polymath who is able to pick up grad school physics level math or a Phd from Steven s is worthless. His publishing career is very mediocre. These scientists will not crack the major problems stopping widespread commercialization of Quantum tech. Simply compare their publishing records to the founder at Ion Q or leading quantum scientists at Google alongside the significant and verifiable technological advancements these companies have made. Another clue that something is amiss is headcount. Rigetti has three fold the number of employees. D Wave six fold. All have similar market cap. What s driving value We ve established that it s not human capital. Iceberg s research reveals it s not intellectual property or physical capital either. So why has it done so well Regarded retail investors. Only 3.3 of Quantum Computing Inc is held by institutional investors . Compared with 40 for IONQ. The lack of institutional investment while institutional investors are simultaneously clamouring to load up on quantum stocks is a massive red flag. In fact no Wall Street analysts track them. So what happens next The 800 rise in one month is going to attract short selling interest as people realise it s junk. The stock will fall back below $1. Risk If you want to short buy puts You can rest assured that the company is not going to suddenly become profitable. The main risk comes from why they ve done so well despite having little revenue expertise or innovation to show for it. They re literally called Quantum Computing Incorporated. If you re a full regard wanting to invest in Quantum computing are you going to invest in IonQ Rigetti or a company conveniently called Quantum Computing It s a regard trap. It s like being interested in electric cars and passing on Tesla because you wanted to invest in a stock called Electric Car Co. My positions 1000 put contracts to sell $4.50 cost average 0.11 expiring Dec 20. If this doesn t work I m going to buy puts again and again.

2024-12-10,GM halts funding of robotaxi development by Cruise General Motors said Tuesday that it will no longer fund robotaxi development work by Cruise citing capital allocation priorities and the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market. The Detroit automaker plans to realign its autonomous driving strategy to focus on advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous systems for use in personal vehicles instead and it will combine the majority owned Cruise LLC and GM technical teams. This summer the Detroit automaker said it would indefinitely delay production of the Origin autonomous vehicle as its Cruise self driving unit attempted to relaunch operations. At that point Cruise began to focus on using the next generation Chevrolet Bolt for development of autonomous vehicles since then. In the U.S. Alphabet owned Waymo has begun to operate commercial robotaxi services across several major metro areas while GM owned Cruise has faltered. Chinese autonomous vehicle makers including Pony.ai and WeRide have rolled out in overseas markets as well. Tesla meanwhile showed off design concepts for a self driving Cybercab at an event in October. Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self Driving software in its vehicles as partially automated driving systems which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self driving ride hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025. SoftBank funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco and Amazon owned Zoox is also testing its autonomous vehicles which do not feature steering wheels in several U.S. cities including San Francisco.

2024-12-10,Google shares rise on new quantum chip breakthrough Shares of Google saw a 4 increase in pre open trading Tuesday reflecting investor confidence following the company s unveiling of its new quantum computing chip Willow. Sundar Pichai CEO of Google introduced the chip on Monday highlighting its ability to significantly reduce computational errors and its performance in benchmark tests. Pichai emphasized the chip s potential in practical applications stating We see Willow as an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications in areas like drug discovery fusion energy battery design more. The new chip according to Pichai has achieved two major milestones. It can exponentially decrease errors with the addition of more qubits addressing a quantum error correction challenge that has persisted for nearly three decades. In addition Willow completed a standard benchmark computation in less than five minutes a task that would take one of the fastest supercomputers today more than 10 septillion years. This development is part of Google s long term commitment to quantum computing a vision that began over a decade ago when Pichai founded Google Quantum AI in 2012. The goal is to build a quantum computer that leverages quantum mechanics to advance scientific discovery and address societal challenges. The announcement drew a simple yet telling reaction from Tesla CEO Elon Musk who expressed his astonishment with a single word wow on social media platform X. The Willow chip represents a significant advancement for Google Quantum AI and positions the company closer to achieving commercially viable quantum computing applications.,reddit,0.9678,0.121,0.026,0.853,0.8827090263366699,0.010021073743700981,0.10726983845233917,positive,positive

2024-12-10,Uber vs Everyone Alright unless you been living under a rock you heard or seen some videos of self driving vehicles be it waymo or tesla. The future of self driving vehicles is not a question of if at this point but when . My question to you is this how do you see uber play out in this changing fat environment. In your view do you see uber benefiting or losing from the rise of AV brought in by smaller and bigger companies. Here is my take and I m also not fully clear . Uber clearly wants to be a software company the biggest aggregator of all mobility needs. They spent like crazy to be number 1 in travel. They spent like crazy during Covid to be the number 1 food delivery service. They spending like crazy on grocery delivery from what I notice and they eye to grow their freight business. All their investments and actions points towards the aggregator strategy from offloading their own self driving decision to Aurora to investing in all kinds of different startup from Serv robotics to Aurora and companies in India Asia and Latin America. Can this strategy back fire It could however let s ask what does Google want Google up until this point was mainly a software company yes they produce their own pixel phones but I believe their main competitor is not Uber but Tesla. Google might be expanding their taxi service but is the end goal for them to be a global taxi company I think not. There is much more profit in expanding the waymo service up until they prove that their software reached maturity. At that point Google will lease that software to any car manufacturer for a price growing revenue in speeds that they won t be able to match staying exclusive hence the Tesla competitor. In the scenario that they lease sell their software to any car manufacturer it won t be the end of the road for Uber because at worst case they can purchase a fleet of cars to continue their operations and supplement their other AV partners. Now let s assume waymo stays exclusive and Google interested to be a taxi company meaning their partnership with Uber will end and they essentially going to compete with Uber. In this case uber investments in Aurora Innovation might come helpful they can re acquire Aurora and their tech for whatever it s worth and build on top of it. They can use their large cash flow to acquire a smaller AV company that struggles to compete with the big players and build on it. In both scenarios uber has a way out as long as they don t lay on their stomach blinded by short term profits and make sure to pivot at the right moment . This is how I see it I will be happy for anyone to challenge this view because sometime we all get blinded by our own biases.,reddit,0.9919,0.134,0.05,0.816,0.12360808998346329,0.02076934278011322,0.8556225895881653,positive,neutral

What did this kind of management behaviour gave as a result for $CVNA Don t start to touch yourself i m not done yet. The market sentiment is almost at an all time low and rightfully so as they navigate a bunch of problems they caused themselves by being kind of moronic. The bet here is that they will improve on that aspect and stop shooting themselves in the foot every 2 minutes. The cars are loved by their owners this is self explanatory a great product will always win and everything will be done to avoid seing it disappear. The new cars will be a massive catalyst up to their launch if you have the patience to hold for at least 1 full year. The R2 will be a best seller and will absolutely destroy the market in which it will be competing. I would 100 buy one if I could. The cars are US made and in this case the US manufactures are not just fighting Tesla they re fighting China and a tech US company going bankrupt will not fly with the Trump administration. Bearish points will be quick we all know why it s a turd Not being gross margin profitable is a crazy achievement for any kind of respected company that s some new regarded level of regardness. They could fail on everything they re trying to accomplish R2 might just be an other turd machine that doesn t fit in any market Elon Musk is literally running the country and has people everywhere maybe he ll just want to fuck with Rivian even if it s a net negative for the US I have more to say but I just gave you bunch of regards way too much to read at once and I don t want to fry the 2 remaining brain cells you still have up there.

2024-12-11,Tesla shares climb to record boosted by 64 pop since Trump election victory Tesla shares jumped to an all time high on Wednesday surpassing their prior record reached in 2021 sparked by a post election rally and Wall Street s increased enthusiasm for Elon Musk s electric vehicle company. The stock rose to an intraday high of $415 which is 50 cents above its previous peak and was on pace to close ahead of its highest finish which was $409.97 on Nov. 4 2021. Tesla s market value has swelled by about 66 this year with almost all of those gains coming since Donald Trump s election victory early last month. The stock s 38 rally in November marked its best monthly performance since January of 2023 and its 10th best on record. Musk poured $277 million into a pro Trump campaign effort according to Federal Election Commission filings and turned his support for the Republican nominee into another full time job ahead of the election funding a swing state operation to register voters and using his social media platform X to constantly tout his preferred candidate frequently with misinformation. The world s richest person who s seen his net worth swell to over $360 billion is set to lead the Trump administration s Department of Government Efficiency alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. His new role could give Musk power over federal agencies budgets staffing and the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. Musk said during a Tesla earnings call in October that he intended to use his sway with Trump to establish a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles. Currently approvals happen at the state level. The stock is responding to the Trump bump Craig Irwin an analyst at Roth MKM told CNBC s Squawk on the Street last week. Irwin had just increased his price target to $380 from $85 writing in a report that Musk s authentic support for Trump likely doubled Tesla s pool of enthusiasts and lifted credibility for a demand inflection. On Wednesday analysts at Goldman Sachs boosted their price target on Tesla joining a parade of firms that have lifted their price expectation or their rating on the stock. The Goldman analysts wrote that the market is taking a more forward looking approach to Tesla including with respect to its AI opportunity. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have also issued bullish reports of late. Since Trump s victory Musk has been accompanying the president elect in meetings with world leaders and began advising him and members of Congress as to which federal agencies regulations and budget items the billionaire would like to eliminate or greatly reduce. Tesla s surge to a record marks a dramatic turn from its performance to start the year. The company s shares plunged 29 in the first three months of 2024 the worst quarter for the stock since the end of 2022 and the third worst since Tesla went public in 2010. At the time investors were concerned about Tesla s core business which reported declining revenue in the first quarter in part due to increased competition from China. In its third quarter earnings report in October Tesla reported a year over year revenue increase of 8 which fell just shy of estimates. However the company reported better than expected profit and Musk said on the earnings call that his best guess is that vehicle growth will reach 20 to 30 next year due to lower cost vehicles and the advent of autonomy. That forecast was ahead of analysts predictions. Source,reddit,0.9948,0.122,0.03,0.848,0.899192214012146,0.018974898383021355,0.08183284848928452,positive,positive

2024-12-11,Siemens worth a look A balanced view. Purpose of this post is to get a sense of sentiment about Siemens. It s not a lazy $hit post asking what do y all think yo But yeah essentially that s what I am asking besides listing down a long list of pros and cons of the company. I ve no position yet but thinking of it. Pros 1. The conglomerate needs no introduction. There s virtually NO piece of any complex industrial machinery that doesn t have at least a few critical components made by Siemens. The company stands to benefit from energy transition mobility urbanization and is focused on high margin specialized components. 2. Valuations 18 PE 1.9 PS 3. News there s plenty of positive news and developments Most notably partnership with NVDA for industrial robotics applications. Won a few contracts in the middle East. 4. Gaining momentum for last 10 days at least the trading volume is virtually all BUY volume . BUY volume means the trades were executed at ask price. Buyers had to up their bids to get hands on the stock. 5. Low retail concentration only 19 retail shareholders. Less susceptible to crowd thinking. It s not your GME or TSLA which will up down 10 in a day. Movements will be very slow and steady. In other words low volatality. It s a steady wealth builder with 14 YTD don t expect 500 in 5 years. Cons 1. German company. Yes yes we know Germany is in recession aging population generally hard business climate.. etc etc. But the company s operations are global. The only geographical risk is you ve a stock in EUR currency not traded as ADR on US exchange . Revenues come from all over the world in many currencies. 2. Lot of competition ABB GE Hitachi Mitsubishi Larsen Toubro.. may not be retail well known names but they all do the same stuff some better some worse.

2024-12-11,ONDS The Drone Play for the MAGA Defense Boom Alright degenerates listen up I ve found the stock that might just be the most Murica thing since bald eagles on Monster Energy cans. Ondas Holdings Inc. is here to ride the wave of border walls drones and some AI wizardry. With Trump back in office and an inevitable boost in defense spending ONDS could be the sleeper pick of the year. Let s break it down in terms even your ape brains can understand. What s the play ONDS isn t your basic drone company. It s got four killer verticals that make it the ultimate bet on MAGA era defense infrastructure and tech spending 1. Autonomous Drones Products Optimus Systems These drones basically never sleep. They re like your ex but useful doing 24 7 surveillance for infrastructure border patrol and even Dubai Police. Scout System A drone in a box setup for industrial monitoring. Think of it as Big Brother for factories. Why this matters now Trump loves big beautiful walls and surveillance tech to guard the homeland. ONDS drones can patrol borders autonomously. Imagine a giant drone wall that never stops. 2. Mission Critical Networks Products A fancy 900 MHz network made for railroads utilities and public safety. It s not just Wi Fi it s industrial grade super secure and built to last. Deployed with Metra and big rail players like Union Pacific. If the train system gets upgraded ONDS wins. Why this matters now The Trump admin is all about America First and that means beefing up critical infrastructure. Think railroads power grids and public safety networks. ONDS has the goods to cash in on this spending spree. 3. Counter Drone Solutions Products Iron Drone Raider This bad boy literally catches rogue drones. It s like Pok mon Go for Homeland Security. Why this matters now Increased focus on securing airspace. Airports military bases and critical infrastructure don t need Karen s Amazon drone snooping around. The Pentagon might be writing Ondas a fat check soon. 4. Artificial Intelligence Products AI to make all the above smarter. Think autonomous decision making for drones and optimizing mission critical networks. Why this matters now Uncle Sam loves AI. Ondas AI enhanced tech fits perfectly into defense strategies for smarter surveillance and threat detection. Show me the tendies ONDS is still in its early innings but let s look at the numbers. Q3 Revenue $1.48M. It s not Tesla numbers but they ve got contracts rolling in from railroads and homeland security deals. They won $14.4M of contracts in Q3 $9M of which was for the Iron Drone. Cash Update After a convertible noteholder pumped in $4M recently ONDS has a total cash war chest of $6.9M . Not great not terrible but enough to push the business forward until more deals hit. Why Trump s Win Makes ONDS a Buy Border Security Drones patrolling the wall Perfect synergy. Defense Spending Counter drone tech mission critical networks and AI systems are top priorities for securing the homeland. Infrastructure Ondas railroad tech plays into the MAGA promise of fixing America s crumbling infrastructure. We re talking $$$ contracts for upgrades. Drones are HOT Just look at what happened with RCAT over the last month. This sector is just getting started and the upside potential on this is huge. But What Could Go Wrong 1. Cashflow Problems $6.9M is better than $2.9M but they ll still need more funding to grow. Not a biggie if they keep closing deals though. 2. Competition The drone market is heating up. ONDS has niche tech but staying ahead of the pack won t be easy. 3. Execution Risks Scaling hardware software tech isn t simple. They ve gotta deliver. My Bullish Thesis Ondas is the perfect storm of defense tech and MAGA era spending priorities. The Trump administration is a literal gold mine for this kind of tech. Drones on the border Check. Counter drone systems for Homeland Security Check. Rail upgrades for MAGA s infrastructure promises Check. ONDS isn t just a bet on drones. It s a bet on Murica . Final Thoughts ONDS is a high risk high reward play. They ve got the tech the partnerships and the perfect timing with Trump s focus on defense and infrastructure. If this stock doesn t moon by Q2 2025 I ll eat my portfolio . Buy the dip hodl through the turbulence and let s ride these drone tendies to the moon. Not financial advice apes.

2024-12-11,Rising Tesla Curious what people here think Is it because Elon is best pals with the next administration Or is it FSD I m really not sure why being pals serves as a catalyst unless the stock was suppressed due to China US issues But doesn t this mean those issues can be exacerbated next 4 years Is it FSD I don t see California and other states approving it no matter how lax the federal government gets if Elon engages in corruption. Each state has their own licensing and investigations irrespective of the federal regulatory body. Or is this just shorts unwinding Any one with insight I think it s a mix of shorts unwinding elon bromance.,reddit,0.6148,0.055,0.022,0.923,0.029014063999056816,0.12408513575792313,0.8469007611274719,positive,neutral

Robotaxi China is way ahead of the States when it comes to Robotaxi and I feel Waymo already has the first movers advantage Model Q it s at least 3 4 years away Tesla doesn t have the turn around time that Chinese companies have Chinese EVs while they won t be allowed in USA but they have made their point they are cheaper equally good and in some cases better Tesla has limited international growth potential now. Like I hear in India people are paying over 100 in tariffs to buy BYD from Singapore they say it s still good value for money Elon will have to make some tall promises in the next earnings call to justify this valuation because he s not selling as many cars and Robotaxi or model Q are still a distant future.,reddit,0.9874,0.172,0.019,0.809,0.07934369891881943,0.056992508471012115,0.8636637330055237,positive,neutral

2024-12-12,Returning to active stock portfolio management I recently decided to return to active stock portfolio management after my first attempt ended somewhat disastrously. To reconcile this experience and entertain others I want to reflect on the mistakes I made and the new approaches I ve adopted. But first briefly the story of my initial failure. When I started managing my portfolio I quickly learned about the S P 500 but was convinced I was smart enough to outperform the market. Arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall. In 2019 I flirted with Bitcoin which initially delivered great returns. Encouraged by the hype I also invested heavily in PaySafe shortly after its IPO believing in its potential because everyone said it was going to be great. At the same time I was doing a lot of day trading. Looking back I realize I wasn t trading rationally. I d look at graphs and invest simply because I felt the price would go up. I was taking desirable outcomes for granted. Although I made a few conservative and reasonable investments their success couldn t offset the losses caused by Bitcoin s decline PaySafe s terrible performance and my risky trading. After 18 months my portfolio was down 40 . The arrogance I started with made the loss feel devastating. I abandoned my investment account for several years. When I returned to it a year ago I discovered that the growth of my conservative investments along with Bitcoin s recovery had boosted my portfolio to 20 growth from my initial investment. I sold everything and bought into the S P 500 feeling that I wasn t capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund. This turned out to be a good action as the S P 500 performed very well this year. Now I feel I ve learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again. To avoid repeating the same mistakes I ve set specific rules to guide me 1. I Avoid Speculative Investments I now steer clear of speculative assets like crypto IPO stocks or companies like Tesla. I want to be a disciplined investor keeping my greed under control. 2. I Reject Market Timing I no longer believe in timing the market but instead focus on time in the market. I avoid trying to buy low today and sell high tomorrow because it s too easy to confuse wishful thinking with reality. Paying attention to micro events can help to take advantage of daily fluctuations but it requires too much time and still offers uncertain outcomes. More often than not it doesn t pay off. 3. Focus on Debt to Equity In the past I ignored the debt to equity ratio. Now I prioritize companies with consistent net income and manageable debt levels. 4. Limit Individual Stock Exposure I cap my individual stock picks at 5 of my total portfolio. Previously this rule would have forced me to find 20 or more stocks to invest in leading to choosing assets that were just okay rather than ones I genuinely liked. Thankfully with most of my portfolio now in the S P 500 individual stock picks act as a good supplement rather than a replacement for the index. 5. Invest in Goods and Services I Value My approach to stock selection has shifted. I now look for companies whose products and services I personally interact with and consider them of great value. If the companies also demonstrate strong financial performance and maintain a reasonable debt to equity ratio they become my choice.

2024-12-12,Elon Musk becomes the first person to reach a net worth of $400 billion Elon Musk s net worth has reached $400 billion according to Bloomberg making him the first person ever to cross that mark. Behind his nearly $20 billion jump in wealth was a deal that shot up Musk s rocket company SpaceX s valuation to roughly $350 billion Bloomberg reported Tuesday. SpaceX and its investors agreed to purchase as much as $1.25 billion of insider shares. Tesla shares closed at a record high on Wednesday hitting $424.77 at market close. Musk who is Tesla s largest individual shareholder has also enjoyed the stock propelling higher in part due to the broader market NASDAQ topped 20 000 for the first time ever Wednesday. Since Election Day the EV maker s stock has rallied roughly 65 on investors belief that Musk s influence in the Trump administration will usher in an era of deregulation that will benefit the company. His artificial intelligence startup xAI also more than doubled in value in November amid a new funding round surging to $50 billion from a few months ago according to the Wall Street Journal. The world s wealthiest man is now roughly $136 billion richer since November 5 according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While the top spots on the billionaires index typically switch around Musk is racing past his wealthy peers. As of December 10 before his wealth skyrocketed to $400 billion he was already $140 billion richer than the second richest man on Earth Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Musk s record breaking Tesla shareholder approved pay package which was worth $101 billion was rejected by a Delaware court last week. Bloomberg s calculation still seems to include the pay package which is now worth as much as $120 billion based on the current value of Tesla shares.,reddit,0.9934,0.177,0.018,0.805,0.7691407799720764,0.02182793989777565,0.20903119444847107,positive,positive

2024-12-16,Achieved my first milestone after 3 years After 3 years of investing I ve finally achieved my goal of investing my first $100 000 This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent finding a decent job that pays 75k 80k a year avoiding fast food where possible and just being frugal in general. Investment strategy 1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. 2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. 3. keeping my ear to the ground and capitalizing on things like meta s stock devaluing. 4. diversifying into other promising tech companies such as Microsoft and Google. I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past it s been difficult watching the stock go up and down but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off and given Elon s position with Trump this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly because of that I can t view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past but that won t diminish it s ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future. Looking forward Since Tesla isn t going to be low for some time one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies such as nuclear for AI companies. So I ll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome My next goal will be to reach $300 000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think Achievable,reddit,0.9732,0.127,0.059,0.814,0.18235144019126892,0.015786897391080856,0.8018617033958435,positive,neutral
2024-12-16,Reminder If You Trade More Wall Street Makes More Money I ve spent a few years reading Warren Buffett and other value investors. Essentially what I learned is that they make money by other people pushing prices too high or too low. Especially when prices become too low they swoop in and buy a bunch. Next they sit on it a few years until the price goes to the correct valuation again or preferably after many years when the company deteriorates. Time and time again people have predicted that Buffett s strategy will eventually stop working. We nowadays can learn much more etc etc. Yet stock prices are all over the place. Tesla doubled in the last 3 months for example. How is that possible How can a 1T dollar company double in value in 3 months They still build the same stuff with roughly the same people. Similar for Bitcoin. Also almost doubled in a few months. If that was inevitable according to some metric then why was it not priced in At the same time there is a common sentiment online that the world is becoming more and more unequal. More wealth accumulates in the hands of a few people. So let me say this if you are currently considering buying into some stock that went up recently please let me remind you that there is only one party that will always make money from your trade. It s not you. It s your broker Wall Street. They don t care whether you make money or lose money. Some will slam price targets on stocks if that makes you trade. Some will call other stocks uninvestible if that makes you trade.,reddit,0.4767,0.055,0.048,0.896,0.04013383761048317,0.13651487231254578,0.8233513236045837,positive,neutral
2024-12-16,Stocks Trading 101 My Guide to the Basics When I first started looking into stock trading the sheer amount of jargon felt overwhelming. Over time I realized that understanding these terms is half the battle. Here are some key concepts and terms that helped me make sense of it all. Stock A piece of ownership in a company. Share One unit of stock or a slice of the company pie. Broker The service or app that connects buyers and sellers I ve used platforms like Robinhood and TD Ameritrade to get started. Bid Price The most someone is willing to pay for a stock at that moment. Ask Price The lowest price someone is willing to sell for. Spread The gap between the bid and ask prices. Smaller spreads often mean more activity and easier trades. Market Order Buying or selling instantly at the current price. Limit Order Setting a specific price at which to buy or sell I use this when I don t want to pay more or accept less than a certain amount. Stop Loss Order Automatically sells to prevent big losses if the stock price drops too much. Trailing Stop Order Similar to a stop loss but moves up with the stock price to lock in profits as the price rises. Bull Market When stock prices are generally going up. Bear Market When stock prices are falling. Volatility Measures how much stock prices go up and down with higher volatility meaning bigger swings. Liquidity Refers to how easy it is to buy or sell a stock without affecting its price much. Stocks with high liquidity feel less stressful to trade. Candlestick Chart Shows price movements over a specific period with details on opening closing highest and lowest prices. Support Level A price where a stock tends to stop falling and bounce back up. Resistance Level A price where a stock tends to stop rising and reverse. Trend Line Shows the general direction of a stock s price. Moving Average Smooths out price fluctuations to reveal trends more clearly. Earnings Per Share A company s profit divided by the number of shares. Higher EPS usually indicates more profitability. Price to Earnings Ratio Shows how much investors are willing to pay for $1 of earnings. A high P E could mean the stock is overvalued or reflect high growth expectations. Dividends Portions of profits paid out to shareholders a nice bonus for holding the stock. Market Cap The total value of all a company s shares combined. A useful way to compare company sizes. Day Trading Involves buying and selling within the same day. It s fast paced and demanding. Swing Trading Involves holding stocks for days or weeks to profit from short term trends. Long Position Buying a stock and expecting the price to rise. Short Position Selling a stock you don t own hoping the price will drop so you can buy it back cheaper. Risk Reward Ratio Balances potential losses and gains with a 1 2 ratio meaning risking $1 to potentially make $2. Diversification Spreads investments across different stocks or sectors to reduce risk. Leverage Borrowing money to trade bigger amplifying both gains and losses. I use it cautiously. Margin Money borrowed from a broker to buy stocks. Helpful but carries real risks. S P 500 Tracks 500 of the largest U.S. companies and is a good measure of the overall market. Dow Jones Industrial Average Tracks 30 major companies and has a more traditional focus. Nasdaq Heavily tech oriented featuring companies like Apple Tesla and Amazon.,reddit,0.9938,0.142,0.081,0.777,0.03421064838767052,0.0394618920981884,0.9263274073600769,positive,neutral
2024-12-16,Tesla Bull and Bear case the great AI and liability gamble Tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently nearly doubling to $1.4T market cap in just three months. The catalyst is Trump s victory and Elon Musk s instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon s influence to relax regulations clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout a potential game changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole. Tesla is trading like an AI startup and for good reason its Full Self Driving system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look. The Bull Case Tesla s data volume Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road each equipped with a suite of cameras Tesla s fleet constantly collects real world driving data. This data acts as a shadow trainer for its AI gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI providing Tesla with even more labeled data. Behind the scenes Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases rare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly Tesla s massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume which usually means better machine learning.On top of this Tesla s vision only approach using cameras without lidar makes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world not just pre mapped areas. The Bear Case Quantity vs. Quality More data is not always better and it s possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments where edge cases are relatively rare while Waymo trains their AI in dense chaotic urban areas. The result is a more diverse dataset that s constantly evolving. Waymo is owned by Alphabet and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar. Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out but failed to do. Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of since it often conflicted with the vision data. But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work. This means that its data is much richer in quality. The urban focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla s suburban heavy dataset giving its AI a potentially richer training environment. The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre mapped areas Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real world deployments today. Tesla by comparison is still at Level 2 which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn t just an incremental step it s an order of magnitude leap in complexity. Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments places like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla s FSD by contrast collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases such as jaywalking pedestrians aggressive lane merges and unexpected construction detours. As the saying goes If you can make it here you can make it anywhere. If Waymo s AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA it s far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast Tesla s suburban data might create a same shit different day scenario where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare high stakes scenarios. Regulatory relaxation is a double edged sword If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory this could limit Tesla s liability especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However accidents involving unsuspecting third parties remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure even for a small number of accidents. Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework courts ultimately determine liability and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best complicity at worst. Tesla s data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics which is very impressive. However publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because again L2 puts the onus on the driver. But it s a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla exposing them to unlimited liability. The scalability myth Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo s reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable but this argument doesn t hold weight for two reasons. First lidar is becoming much cheaper and with volume production costs could approach Tesla s camera only system. Ironically Elon s first principles philosophy should be applied here just because something was a certain way before doesn t mean it has to be that way. Secondly the market for taxis in general is urban. When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed giving it a more focused path to profitability. Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google Waymo uses millions of AI generated simulations to train its system. It s AI teaching AI similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations but Waymo s superior compute power means it s clearly dominant in this regard. Tesla bulls often cite Elon s dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla s superior approach. But they overlook Google s hegemony in AI. They were in the game before anyone. They delivered AlphaGo AlphaFold and many other paradigm shifting world changing products backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla s Dojo may be promising but it s still a newbie. tl dr Tesla s $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving which is to say its lead in AI. If Tesla dominates AI the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality liability risks and Waymo s technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind. In which case it s vastly overvalued. Full disclosure I m currently short the stock. That could change if the price goes down.,reddit,0.9953,0.116,0.072,0.812,0.14375802874565125,0.01721206307411194,0.8390299677848816,positive,neutral
2024-12-16,From GPU to ASIC Broadcom to capture NVDA market share Broadcom Surge Highlights the Importance of AI Let s start with some expert opinions I read over the weekend about Broadcom s impressive rally views I completely agree with At the hardware level training costs are skyrocketing limiting participation to a few CSP that can afford it. As economies of scale see diminishing returns these companies are shifting their strategies toward customer acquisition commercialization and retention similar to Microsoft s current approach. With growing focus on model deployment and revenue generation inference is bound to take center stage. Open source models are becoming more valuable enabling AI application developers to focus on building apps rather than training models from scratch. It s akin to the role Linux played during the cloud operating system boom. The traditional scaling laws based on data are nearing a bottleneck. We re likely approaching the end of the pretraining era with the future pointing towards the Agent and Reason age. Here s the key takeaway Broadcom predicts that by 2027 its three largest existing clients will deploy over one million arithmetic card units. Additionally two more clients are undergoing validation potentially driving $60 90 billion in AI related revenue. That said expectations for overall AI capital expenditure changes remain modest. This shift represents more of a structural change in existing capital allocation. NVIDIA which currently dominates with over 75 of the arithmetic card market may see its lead challenged. Broadcom s ASIC solutions and NVIDIA s GPUs could eventually share the market. Once AI models stabilize ASIC being application specific could offer a significant cost advantage over general purpose GPU. For major cloud providers the massive capital expenditures have sparked criticism from shareholders. At this point these companies must demonstrate revenue growth to justify the spending. As I write this AVGO is soaring again. Broadcom rise was anticipated but the market sentiment is electrifying. Investors are desperately hunting for the next NVDA. After cashing out Tesla last week I thought Monday might bring a big move for Tesla. Instead Broadcom stole the spotlight. While Tesla did rise it couldn t match Broadcom momentum. No need to fear heights Broadcom rally has just begun.,reddit,-0.0662,0.056,0.035,0.909,0.6138389706611633,0.06395260989665985,0.3222084641456604,negative,positive
2024-12-16,2.5 year follow up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks I bought the dip on several pandemic stocks that had significant declines in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1 2 times a year. In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I m also working on a self funded AI startup which keeps me in the loop on AI. Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There s more context in my previous updates linked below. Previous updates Progress updates Below are the returns for this portfolio as of December 2024. Realized in 2023 Affirm 18.09 Allbirds 6.89 Coinbase 6.42 Carvana 845.57 Meta 256.36 Cloudflare 50.67 Netflix 122.39 Peloton 71.51 Roblox 25.57 Shopify 51.27 Snapchat 1.99 Unity 27.57 See the for comments.

So I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation defensibility and long term prospects. In this case I believe that diversification among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they re all highly correlated and despite its market cap Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We ll see if the bet pays off. To clarify I am confident in the long term prospects of Palantir Tesla and others but I m just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change. Meta is the only other stock I held onto given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation. Unrealized Meta 367.97 Nvidia 117.05 Nvidia s performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings but it s up 200 since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months. These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights but I d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Rate of return My annual return for this portfolio is 73.6 . Investment thesis See a summary of my investment thesis in a TL DR AI is another secular trend like PCs the internet and mobile . The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore the 350 run up over the last 12 months doesn t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year but rather it s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what s coming thanks to NVIDIA s CUDA among Nov. 2023 Nvidia s dominance I m still working through my thoughts here but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations Nvidia is and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It s unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast growing valuable industry while maintaining such a long term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments over decades making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies . Despite their impressive growth Nvidia is still supply constrained which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly we ve barely scratched the surface of AI s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets the more use cases we ll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I m still well within the maybe I m just lucky phase since it s only been a couple years.

I bitched out on everything because I have such tight funds and was worried of losing anything and now I m looking at the year in review and my paper trades for those companies and I am KILLING MYSELF. Any personal advice for continuing and not getting discouraged feeling like I am not gonna pick well again Edit didn t expect this to really get attention and maybe only a couple replies not be on the front page But thanks to everyone who gave me words of wisdom whether hard to hear or not. I m just grateful for lessons and knowledge and perspective stories etc since I m still a beginner and determined to learn this. Edit 2 To be clear I mean Trusting my gut based on charts stats earnings valuation market cap growth potential net operating income Etc. actual numerical data and news. I m not just saying Ooooo that looks good I got a good feeling about this one No that s actually just roulette and I m not tryna live like that. Also a big reason I didn t take the risks is because money is so damn tight and I was trying to have more capital for making decent investments as opposed to smaller or less likely contracts or shares for things I thought would maybe give me some return on now but probably still had some time or that I didn t have enough to make more than a 10s of dollars on. so I did the safer thing.

2024-12-16,Tesla Bull and Bear case the great AI and liability gamble Tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently nearly doubling to $1.4T market cap in just three months. The catalyst is Trump s victory and Elon Musk s instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon s influence to relax regulations clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout a potential game changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole. Tesla is trading like an AI startup and for good reason its Full Self Driving system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look. The Bull Case Tesla s data volume Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road each equipped with a suite of cameras Tesla s fleet constantly collects real world driving data. This data acts as a shadow trainer for its AI gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI providing Tesla with even more labeled data. Behind the scenes Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases rare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly Tesla s massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume which usually means better machine learning.On top of this Tesla s vision only approach using cameras without lidar makes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world not just pre mapped areas. The Bear Case Quantity vs. Quality More data is not always better and it s possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments where edge cases are relatively rare while Waymo trains their AI in dense chaotic urban areas. The result is a more diverse dataset that s constantly evolving. Waymo is owned by Alphabet and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar. Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out but failed to do. Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of since it often conflicted with the vision data. But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work. This means that its data is much richer in quality. The urban focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla s suburban heavy dataset giving its AI a potentially richer training environment. The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre mapped areas Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real world deployments today. Tesla by comparison is still at Level 2 which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn t just an incremental step it s an order of magnitude leap in complexity. Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments places like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla s FSD by contrast collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases such as jaywalking pedestrians aggressive lane merges and unexpected construction detours. As the saying goes If you can make it here you can make it anywhere. If Waymo s AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA it s far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast Tesla s suburban data might create a same shit different day scenario where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare high stakes scenarios. Regulatory relaxation is a double edged sword If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory this could limit Tesla s liability especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However accidents involving unsuspecting third parties remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure even for a small number of accidents. Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework courts ultimately determine liability and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best complicity at worst. Tesla s data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics which is very impressive. However publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because again L2 puts the onus on the driver. But it s a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla exposing them to unlimited liability. The scalability myth Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo s reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable but this argument doesn t hold weight for two reasons. First lidar is becoming much cheaper and with volume production costs could approach Tesla s camera only system. Ironically Elon s first principles philosophy should be applied here just because something was a certain way before doesn t mean it has to be that way. Secondly the market for taxis in general is urban. When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed giving it a more focused path to profitability. Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google Waymo uses millions of AI generated simulations to train its system. It s AI teaching AI similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations but Waymo s superior compute power means it s clearly dominant in this regard. Tesla bulls often cite Elon s dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla s superior approach. But they overlook Google s hegemony in AI. They were in the game before anyone. They delivered AlphaGo AlphaFold and many other paradigm shifting world changing products backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla s Dojo may be promising but it s still a newbie. tl dr Tesla s $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving which is to say its lead in AI. If Tesla dominates AI the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality liability risks and Waymo s technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind. In which case it s vastly overvalued.,reddit,0.9953,0.118,0.073,0.809,0.14375802874565125,0.01721206307411194,0.8390299677848816,positive,neutral

2024-12-17,Ponzi Spotting a laymen s guide to differentiating investments from Ponzi schemes I often see things being called Ponzi schemes on Reddit that are very much not Ponzi schemes. Usually it always stems from the criticism that a particular investment only goes up in price because someone newer is paying a higher price for it. Hence it must be a Ponzi. I m going to blow your minds a little bit. Almost all investments require new investors willing to pay a higher price for older investors to cash out a profit. Most investable objects REGARDLESS of what underlies the object trade at a price on a market. This means at the margin some percentage of the total available supply of the object is trading hands. The trade is priced typically in your local fiat currency but this does not necessarily have to be the case. Prices are determined by supply and demand. When an investable object goes up in price on a market it means there were no sellers of the object at the lower price and price goes up until the next marginal seller decides they are willing to part with that object at the higher price. The use of the term investable object is intentionally left extremely broad. It essentially means anything quantifiable that can be owned and traded. This includes contracts stocks bonds physical objects digital objects etc. Example 1. You bought a 1st edition charizard for 20 dollars when it came out in the 1990 s. Since it was relatively abundant and Pokemon was relatively new at the time the supply was high and the demand was low. Fast forward 30 years Pokemon is super popular and there are very few 1st edition charizards remaining . You now are able to sell the charizard for 10 000 dollars to a guy that just got into Pokemon card collecting. Congratulations you bought low and sold high Was what you participated in a Ponzi scheme because you made a profit by selling to a new investor I really hope your answer to this is no. If you think the answer is yes you can stop reading here because I don t think anything I m going to say beyond this point is going to help you. The next step in logic is realizing this charizard example is essentially how ALL INVESTMENT RETURNS are made when the investable object at hand is not providing a direct flow of cash. This is true for non dividend stocks derivatives physical collectibles like pet rocks beanie babies tulip bulbs and digital collectibles like in game skins NFTs cryptocurrencies etc. Examples of cash flowing investments would be dividend stocks direct ownership of small businesses such that net profits are available to you or rental properties. It is important to note while ultimately supply and demand determine if a price for an investable object goes up over time the underlying reason an investable object has demand at all can be wildly different from object to object. The reason some people want first edition charizards is usually a very different reason people want to own a stock of a company. It is within the eye of the investor to decide if the reason is a good reason and hopefully a reason that leads to increased demand in the future. So what is a Ponzi According to ChatGPT a Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment scam that promises high returns with little or no risk to investors. The scheme relies on using the funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors rather than generating legitimate profit from actual investments or business activities. Eventually the scheme collapses when it becomes impossible to recruit enough new investors or when too many existing investors try to withdraw their money at the same time. That seems like a pretty good definition to me The part that everyone focuses on when thinking about a Ponzi is this part the scheme relies on using funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors. This sounds extremely similar to my charizard example yet I hope you have the intellectual honesty to accept that a real Ponzi scheme is different from buying low and selling high. The part that is extremely important in addition to old investor returns being funded by new investors is that the scheme PROMISES a return. The reality is that many Ponzi schemes do not start off as Ponzi schemes. There are sometimes investment funds that partake briefly in Ponzi like behavior to paper over potential insolvency during a downturn and then return to legitimate investment activities when the market improves. Doing this is quite risky and is still illegal because if you aren t able to essentially over deliver on future returns to even things out you re essentially stuck in an endless cycle of repaying old investors who cash out with newer investor money turning your once legitimate investment fund into a Ponzi scheme. The right move is to always be open and honest about what returns you re able to achieve for your investors to avoid being stuck in the Ponzi loop I described. Another attribute of Ponzi schemes is that Ponzi s almost always violently collapse once the perceived value of the fund goes down. This is because once a Ponzi stops attracting new money it becomes apparent very quickly that the liabilities of the fund far outstrip the assets. Example 2. Imagine a hypothetical Ponzi scheme. The Ponzi fund initially accepted $1 000 dollars from 10 eager investors in a local town. The fund manager promises a 10 annual yield so that in 1 year s time any of the original investors can withdraw $1 100 if they so please. Unfortunately our manager really sucks at operating this Ponzi and after 1 year obtains exactly zero new clients. His liabilities at the end of the year are now $11 000 but he only has $10 000 of cash on hand. Even more unfortunately for him Taylor Swift is announced to be coming to town and tickets are on sale now and the tickets incidentally cost $1 100. All his investors want to cash out immediately so they ask for their money back. The first 9 that come to him are able to get their money back . When the 10th person comes back he realizes there s only $100 for him not the $1 100 he was promised The fund not only has basically no money left it owes $1000. The 10th person notifies the police and our unfortunate fund manager is arrested for fraud. I will note that in this example this scheme required 90 of the investors to withdraw for the scheme to collapse but examples in history tend to be much more skewed where even a small withdrawal of 1 5 of investors can completely collapse the scheme. Returning to the investable object definition once a Ponzi runs out of new investors to pay prior investors the investable object completely disappears because the fund you thought was flush with desirable investable objects actually had a negative cash balance the entire time Behind the curtain there actually was no object at all. This is in contrast to our buy low sell high example with the charizard card. The charizard market could hypothetically collapse tomorrow such that the market price drops from $10 000 to $1. Maybe everyone collectively realizes Pokemon is super lame and that Yugioh is the superior card game. At the end of the day there are two truths you still own the investable object aka the charizard and no one promised you a return for owning it. You can always wait it out hoping that people become interested in charizards again. I hope this somewhat lengthy piece was helpful in elucidating Ponzi schemes for anyone that read this far. I often see CLEARLY non Ponzi investable objects being echo chambered as Ponzi s on Reddit when it really stems from a misunderstanding of the investable object or the mechanics of investment itself. If your investable object trades on an open market and nominal gains are made through price increases due to supply and demand dynamics it is almost certainly not a Ponzi. If nobody is promising you a return it also probably isn t a Ponzi. This does not mean your investable object itself is not a scam or a bubble. That determination should be made with your best judgment of the fundamentals that underlie the object itself. I will leave you with 2 final examples to illustrate this. Example 3. Tesla stock is neither a Ponzi nor a scam . It might be a bubble if you think the company s market cap is too high for what its future profits will be. Example 4. Nikola stock is not a Ponzi but it was a scam. The CEO lied to investors about how functional the cars were and how many they sold .,reddit,0.998,0.131,0.088,0.781,0.044238895177841187,0.0830223336815834,0.872738778591156,positive,neutral
2024-12-17,First time beating the SP500 in 3 years. Also reached my second goal of half a milli I started investing in November 2017 and I was doing great during the bull run. Unfortunately everything crashed down in 2021 and I spent 3 years kicking myself thinking I should ve just put everything on SPY and forget it. In the last few months I can finally say that my portfolio is beating the index again. At some point during December 2022 my portfolio was 35 while in comparison if I had put it on SPY I would still be positive. This traumatized me a bit and now that I am finally beating the index over the last 7.2 years I have three main thoughts 1. Is the volatility worth it 2. I m up on some names anything from 200 800 which makes them seem overvalued and makes me hesitate on buying more of those companies 3. Feels like a 30 haircut can happen at any moment and Im just dreading when it comes. Summary Portfolio is up 193 since inception sitting at 595K Breakdown Tsla 45 Pltr 25 Btc 17 Clpt 6 Abcl 3 Rest less than 5 Beam Clsk Nvda AMD Meta I think for now im going to either lower my average on the few names im still down or just slightly up and believe strongly like Beam or Meta OR just buy SPY and turn that into Tsla BTC or Pltr only if there is a big correction in those names.

2024-12-18,NVIDIA s Recent Decline and Opportunities for a New Rally NVIDIA fell nearly 4 today before narrowing the loss to 1.22 . Since hitting a record closing high of $148.88 in early November the AI chip maker s stock has dropped over 10 . So what is causing NVIDIA s decline 1. Supply Chain Issues and Challenges NVIDIA faces multiple challenges in its supply chain a significant factor in its stock decline. First according to the latest data the order volume and schedules for the GB200 and GB300 have been adjusted. Particularly the mass production and shipment of GB series products have been postponed until after the Lunar New Year in February increasing market uncertainty. Additionally the small scale production plans for GB300 face tight deadlines putting pressure on GB200 s mass production. Specific supply chain issues include CoWoS L packaging technology heating problems copper cable connections and leakage issues. These not only affect product yield rates but also increase system integration time costs. Consequently NVIDIA has suggested customers purchase the B200 8 card HGX as a transitional solution and clients like Microsoft are considering switching their orders. These supply chain issues affect NVIDIA s product delivery capabilities and reduce market expectations for its future performance. 2. Market Competition and Narrative Changes ASICs are gaining market recognition as a competitive narrative. ASICs are chips designed for specific tasks akin to custom running shoes for a race. For certain tasks ASICs outperform NVIDIA s GPUs and are potentially cheaper. OpenAI co founder Ilya and industry leaders like Microsoft s CEO Satya have started discussing the importance of not only training AI models but also ensuring they can quickly and accurately make decisions in real applications. This shift in perspective gives ASICs an advantage in some scenarios as they are designed for rapid precise execution of tasks. This raises questions about the cost of NVIDIA s GPUs. While powerful they are expensive and require significant electricity and cooling. As ASICs perform better at lower costs for some tasks there s consideration of replacing NVIDIA s GPUs with ASICs. Additionally changes in scaling law narratives and the strengthening of inference narratives pose threats to NVIDIA. Scaling laws suggest that increasing AI model size typically improves performance but these gains are not infinite and require significant computational resources. This means NVIDIA must continually invest resources to improve product performance potentially increasing costs. Moreover companies like BTC Tesla and Google are investing heavily in their own AI chips or solutions. This intensifies market competition and challenges NVIDIA s leadership. 3. Market Sentiment and Capital Flows Market sentiment and capital flow significantly impact NVIDIA s stock price. As the year ends retail investors ETFs and institutions adjust their portfolios. Fluctuations in tech giants like Microsoft Apple and Google affect tech stocks like NVIDIA. Investors are more cautious favoring stable promising companies. Given these conditions NVIDIA faces pressure on its stock price due to supply chain issues and competition. Lowered expectations for NVIDIA s future performance lead to capital outflows and stock price declines. 4. Future Outlook and Catalysts Despite current challenges NVIDIA has opportunities for a turnaround. First NVIDIA needs to resolve supply chain issues improve product yield and delivery capabilities. Second strengthening its presence in software and applications is crucial to addressing market competition. Additionally NVIDIA should explore new computing narratives to expand its computing potential. 5. Technical Analysis and Price Divergence Previously prices rose continuously but volume and KDJ began to decline showing divergence. Without capital support upward momentum was insufficient leading to a short term adjustment and a break below the mid term trend line resulting in a mid term adjustment. When Might a New Rally Occur From a technical analysis perspective After two prior mid term adjustments breaking the downward trend line may signal the start of a new rally. Thus this new rally must first break the resistance line. From a catalyst perspective While January s CES and the earnings release in late February may not bring major surprises March s GTC is worth anticipating. NVIDIA needs to showcase new technologies and products at this event to restore market confidence. If NVIDIA can introduce groundbreaking innovations a stock rebound is possible.,reddit,0.998,0.145,0.035,0.82,0.0556100457906723,0.8828138709068298,0.06157602742314339,positive,negative
2024-12-18,Self driving business grows 6x Uber is clearly misplaced by the market and is on the verge of 50 upside Shares of Uber have fallen more than 30 from their October 2024 highs in just a few weeks on concerns that self driving cars could eliminate intermediary services While news such as Google s Waymo skipping Uber to enter the self driving cab business in Miami is thought provoking enough to make some investors uneasy Uber s positioning as the transportation app for everyone an aggregator of all transportation needs for more than 160 million consumers makes it an inevitable market platform for self driving car companies. This makes it an inevitable market platform for self driving car companies. Tesla and Google have deep pockets but building a bilateral network of self driving cabs from scratch would cost tens of billions of dollars take years to achieve scalable economics and make it difficult to change customer behavior despite the novelty of driverless cabs. Additionally Uber has partnered with several AV providers to bring self driving cabs to its platform From an economic standpoint it makes more sense to partner with Uber as an AV supplier than to try to create demand on a new network of self driving cabs with a limited and expensive AV fleet. Now in the past Uber s leadership team has used self driving cars as TAM extenders which is the right thought process as increased supply in the form of robo taxis could potentially lower Uber s cost per mile which in turn would push penetration and total bookings higher The growth of the self driving car market will unfold over the next decade or two so it seems premature to abandon Uber based on concerns about disintermediation. As long as Uber s business grows as planned there s no reason to panic sell. On the contrary Uber stock s recent decline has significantly improved its long term risk reward with TQI s five year expected compound annual growth rate for Uber jumping from 16.1 to 25.8 . Based on forward looking estimates Uber s revenue will continue to grow at a healthy double digit rate over the next five years As a result in today s valuation the analysts are sticking with the growth and margin assumptions used in their previous assessment of Uber. That is updating Uber s revenue base to $43.71 billion and updating the stock count to 2.154 billion shares. All other assumptions remain unchanged and relatively simple. Based on the valuation model Uber s fair value is approximately $105.50 per share or currently undervalued by approximately 45 . In addition given the sharp decline Uber s long term risk reward has improved considerably. Given its 5 year expected compound annual growth rate is currently about 25.8 well above our 15 investment threshold rate. In a historically expensive stock market Uber is now one of the few large tech stocks that offer amazing value Uber is making every effort to become a reliable money printing machine. Given Uber s fast growing cash flow production and the shareholder friendly capital allocation policies adopted by management investors had plenty of margin of safety in this large tech stock. Now Uber stock is finally pulling back. Yes Uber s image has been poor due to recent self driving cab developments however Uber s business is in good shape with continued strong sales and profitability growth In Q3 2024 Uber s total bookings increased 16 year over year to $40.97 billion driven by healthy growth in MAPC and MAPC usage frequency . Additionally Uber s cash conversion continued to improve at a rapid pace in Q3 with free cash flow increasing 133 year over year to $2.1 billion. From a technical perspective Uber shares are above the 100 week moving average which could be strong support. Additionally the 200 week moving average is at $47. Given that Uber s weekly RSI is near oversold territory the $47 $57 range is a strong buy zone for long term investors.,reddit,0.9985,0.165,0.045,0.79,0.6703404784202576,0.20211011171340942,0.12754938006401062,positive,positive

2024-12-19,Question on Tesla Could a Potential Fallout Between Elon Musk and Trump Justify a Short Position If the alliance between Elon Musk and Donald Trump proves to be short lived which seems plausible given their mutual need to always be in the driver s seat and if the current Tesla rally is partially fueled by the perceived strength of their relationship could this present a case for shorting Tesla While there s no direct tension yet some news outlets have sarcastically referred to Musk as an unelected figure eager to steal the spotlight suggesting that his high profile actions might overshadow others. This raises the question Is Tesla s current rally driven by the perceived good relationship between Musk and Trump or is it rooted in a genuine improvement in Tesla s revenue outlook If the rally is supported by a stronger business foundation this speculative angle may hold little weight. Conversely if public perception and narratives are the primary drivers the risk of a fallout could present a case for downside potential. For disclosure while I am currently long on Tesla my holdings are relatively small. Nevertheless I believe this thesis deserves further exploration for those considering speculative positions.,reddit,0.8645,0.106,0.053,0.841,0.16052958369255066,0.06392696499824524,0.7755433917045593,positive,neutral

2024-12-20,Every Monday morning I invest $1 885. Here is how I divvy it up can y all provide feedback opinions on my investing strategy please I m an early 30s single guy with a solid income. I invest $1885.00 every week which amounts to roughly half of my take home pay and I live off the other half. I live in a very high cost of living city and I rent an apartment. I ve got a very long time horizon so I m trying to be aggressive. Here is how I divvy my money Stock Amount Invested Percentage of investment S P 500 ETF $700 37.14 NASDAQ 100 ETF $400 21.22 MAG 6 $180 9.55 Small Caps $120 6.37 Bitcoin ETF $100 5.30 Financial Sector ETFs $80 4.244 Semiconductors ETF $80 4.244 Individual Stock Picks I like $225 11.94 TOTAL $1885 100 The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa Mastercard Bank of America Wells Fargo etc... whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley Schwab S P Global etc... There is only a 15 overlap between these two ETFs. The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are Adobe AMD Broadcom Chipotle Salesforce Door Dash Netflix ServiceNow Palo Alto Networks Palantir Shopify Sofi Bank Uber I think at first glance some will say that there is a little redundancy here such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

2024-12-20,Can Tesla bounce back quickly Tesla stock has been on a recent surge especially after Trump s victory with shares soaring from $246.23 to $487 a gain of nearly 97 . This rise has been largely driven by politics particularly Musk s relationship with Trump. But the question is how long will this premium due to politics last Tesla s future is also closely tied to Fully Self Driving . If FSD is successfully rolled out and receives regulatory approval Tesla could transform into an online car company which would be a steady source of cash flow. However regulatory issues and technology rollout remain challenges. Although Tesla s stock price has risen sharply analysts have mixed views on its outlook. Barclays maintains a Neutral rating believing that Tesla s stock price is out of touch with the company s fundamentals with a price target of $270. CFRA on the other hand is more optimistic about Tesla raising its price target to $560 believing that the elimination of the electric vehicle tax credit will help Tesla expand its market share. Going forward Tesla could be at risk of a stock price correction but if FSD goes smoothly and there are no regulatory hurdles Tesla s long term outlook remains bullish. Tesla followed suit in the face of Powell s news announcement over the past two days when will it return to its high value,reddit,0.9827,0.138,0.021,0.841,0.9088751077651978,0.03223748505115509,0.058887410908937454,positive,positive

2024-12-20,Could GOEV Be a Hidden Gem and at a Place When Tesla Was at $1.33 Only or When Bitcoin was but Mere Cents Only Hi investing friends could GOEV be a hidden gem and now at a place when Tesla was at $1.33 or when BTC was mere cents about a decade and a half ago It was ignored coz no one was buying much. It s always tough to see looking forward though I always look at who s creating what who s the real leader and Canoo s leader seems maybe a few percentages of Elon Musk. The Canoo founder has a lot of patents it seems innovative it seem similar to Elon had a successful venture . But only time will tell if the pattern will repeat itself with Canoo it has a great design innovative especially their MPDV . It just needs to launch already their working models have amazing design especially the shelf mechanism of their nice looking MPDV. If they just did a pre order which is a genius strategy pioneered by amazing Apple God willing they will break through but they also need to upgrade their battery from 200mi to 320mi for good measure. They need to launch now coz the chinese EVs are coming with tariffs by Pres. Trump or not it s like finished or not finished pass your papers.

2024-12-20,Every Monday morning I invest $1 885. Here is how I divvy it up can y all provide feedback opinions on my investing strategy please I m an early 30s single guy with a solid income. I invest $1885.00 every week which amounts to roughly half of my take home pay and I live off the other half. I live in a very high cost of living city and I rent an apartment. I ve got a very long time horizon so I m trying to be aggressive. Here is how I divvy my money Stock Amount Invested Percentage of investment S P 500 ETF $700 37.14 NASDAQ 100 ETF $400 21.22 MAG 6 $180 9.55 Small Caps $120 6.37 Bitcoin ETF $100 5.30 Financial Sector ETFs $80 4.244 Semiconductors ETF $80 4.244 Individual Stock Picks I like $225 11.94 TOTAL $1885 100 The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa Mastercard Bank of America Wells Fargo etc... whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley Schwab S P Global etc... There is only a 15 overlap between these two ETFs. The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are Adobe AMD Broadcom Chipotle Salesforce Door Dash Netflix ServiceNow Palo Alto Networks Palantir Shopify Sofi Bank Uber I think at first glance some will say that there is a little redundancy here such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds. I m open to feedback from others. I m trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36 of my money in the S P and Nasdaq getting small cap exposure exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities .

2024-12-20,Nvidia Will Be the next Intel Why I m bearish long term. TSMC is the true winner Right now Google Microsoft Apple Amazon and Meta are all spending more than Nvidia on R D and are developing their own AI chips. Tesla and AMD are also developing AI chips. Right now tech companies are only buying Nvidia s chips to get started and build market share because they do not want to fall behind their competition. Using Nvidia s chips at current prices is not profitable even successful AI companies such as OpenAI fail to achieve positive operating margins despite a highly popular product with paid features. Large tech companies are reluctantly buying Nvidia s hardware to avoid falling behind their competition in market share. But relying on Nvidia long term is never the intention these companies need to be profitable eventually Nvidia is just there to get them started. The thing is Nvidia s 74.56 gross margin is a strength but its also a vulnerability. It demonstrates that any AI company that can cut out Nvidia can significantly reduce their costs and that s why everyone is building their own chips. They don t need to be faster than Nvidia to succeed they just need to be fast enough to provide services at a lower cost which is quite a low bar. Developing new products takes time which is why Nvidia s windfall has lasted. But give it 1 3 more years and you ll start to see the impact on Nvidia s sales. With everyone rushing to develop their own chips and all of them relying on TSMC TSMC has the true windfall. They will certainly be able to hike their prices on wafers due to increased demand which will hurt Nvidia s margins. Intel was once a dominant and unstoppable player in the semiconductor space but then they got too comfortable and started spending their cash flow on dividends and stock buybacks instead of reinvesting in R D. We see how that played out with AMD catching up and stealing market share and now Intel is struggling. No moat is impenetrable. Nvidia is following in Intel s footsteps with their $50 Billion stock buyback plan at 50x earnings. Despite facing competition from the largest tech companies with deep pockets they are spending their record windfall just to buy back less than 2 of their shares outstanding. This will be their downfall. They are not hedging their reliance on TSMC by seeking to acquire or develop their own fab business they are not increasing R D sufficiently to stay ahead of their competition. This will be their downfall. In 5 10 years Nvidia will almost certainly have thinner margins and less market share in the AI space as their customers develop their own in house solutions. At best Nvidia will be relied upon for niche applications where performance is essential.,reddit,0.9698,0.12,0.087,0.794,0.15920856595039368,0.30028223991394043,0.5405091643333435,positive,neutral

2024-12-21,I have stop trading options and became rich again. Stopped Who cares how I did it if you re losing you should stop and start thinking but anyways here s my current play. Don t do what I m doing as I have other investments apart from those high risk high reward. When you are pushed in a corner you must study read listen watch countless of hours and I promise you will make it through Warning I am heavily invested in high risk ETFS I wil name them bellow . I started accumulating this week. All Roads lead to Rome In the short term all signs point to strong returns driven by America s economic exceptionalism. I expect significant gains by early or mid 2025 from the following positions ETF TNA . ETF UDOW . ETF FAS . ETF 3x Bull ETF ether ETHU Why not by the end of the year A market correction in the early or mid part of 2025 is a real possibility which is why I m positioning for the short term gains A Key Reminder from a Legendary Investor One of the most respected fixed income investors of all time whom Warren Buffett sought advice from Mark Howard s once said The market can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent. You may think the market is overpriced but the premium you re paying for American stocks is justified because the U.S. is the world s greatest economy. Keep in mind this is from someone that does not invest a penny in securities or seldom does and continues to buy bonds when the 2008 crash occurred he was considered one of the smartest since his portfolio barely took a hit and made billions upon billions afterwards. He greatly reminds us that investing is a losers game and predicting the future is not possible On that note you can for certain know that whatever what happened in the past is not a good indication of future Performance but you can be certain that you can analyze today and today is American economic exceptionalism For dummies this means that there is no greater economy American exceptionalism was a political word used by the early settlers. Almost every president uses it but today you are actually living it . A beacon light upon a hill in which the eyes of the world is set up on us an example to the world. I have a minor in political science once I thought it would be useless to study . I did for fun What I Know for Sure While I can t predict what will happen tomorrow here s what I can say about today Job Market There s never been a better time to find a job. Boomers are retiring in large numbers and younger generations aren t filling those gaps. With immigration restrictions tightening job openings will continue to rise. Interest Rates Inflation Whether rates go up down or stay the same any shift is just an opportunity to buy. Despite inflation GDP growth will likely outpace any downturns. All signs point to a strong American economy. Political Environment The new administration may bring volatility and media distractions but over time you ll get used to it. And the market will get use to it in fact it will become almost meaningless . As long as the economy remains strong those disruptions won t matter. Final Thought from Warren Buffett In Buffett s words America is like a train that keeps moving forward picking up more passengers along the way. Occasionally it may get derailed or need to stop but it will always get back on track and keep moving forward. You will never know why he sold yet is it because his age is it because he actually believes at the market is overvalued if so he would have listen to Mark Howard s in his recent interview I believe it is more of a shifting of strategy plus or minus his given age and his future holdings not a reflection of what he believes about the American economy Current holdings PLTR sold 2 3 at 400 gain rest are locked forever TSLA 170 average any major dip is honey the Cinderal story BABA the Chinese awakening Uber purchased at 61$ Hood 20$ I see other opportunities Trow the finance story Block Finance story Broadcom and NVDIA are both to be owned,reddit,0.9916,0.113,0.071,0.816,0.06122488155961037,0.03569038212299347,0.9030847549438477,positive,neutral

2024-12-23,When Tech Eventually Fizzles Will U.S. Continue to Dominate Backtesting Excluding Tech vs. Global Markets Edit People are misunderstanding the question. I m not bearish on tech. It s more of a question of US continuing to out perform the global market once the expected returns on tech slows. TL DR As tech s strong performance fades why should we believe the U.S. market will continue to outperform globally Has anyone already backtested the S P 500 excluding tech especially the Magnificent 7 and compared its performance to developed and emerging markets Over the past 15 years the U.S. market has massively outperformed global equities leading to the narrative that U.S. governance monetary policy the strength of the dollar and favorable geopolitical conditions will continue to support this dominance. This view is widely accepted in this community . However the primary driver of U.S. outperformance has been the tech sector particularly the Magnificent 7 . A quick search shows that these companies have been responsible for a significant portion of U.S. market returns over the past two decades with tech alone contributing heavily to the growth of the S P 500. But what happens when the tech sector eventually hits a slowdown or correction While it could continue to dominate for another decade at some point the market may shift and another sector or region could rise to prominence. So if tech loses its edge what is left to support U.S. market dominance I m particularly interested in whether anyone has backtested the S P 500 excluding tech stocks and compared its performance against global markets both developed and emerging. Excluding the top tech names from the S P 500 could provide a more realistic view of the underlying market performance without the distortion caused by these mega cap stocks which are arguably overvalued or at least priced for significant future growth. I m asking this because as a long term passive investor I think the MAG 7 may be overvalued and their strong returns over the past 15 years might not be sustainable. To further diversify my portfolio I ve begun investing in US mid and small cap S P funds but I m also looking to increase my exposure to global equities. From what I can see excluding tech from the equation international equities don t appear to underperform as much relative to U.S. stocks. So I m interested in seeing if global diversification especially in emerging markets would still yield solid returns after this adjustment. A few questions I have Has anyone conducted a backtest or analysis of the S P 500 s performance excluding the Magnificent 7 How does it compare to global markets particularly developed and emerging markets If tech returns eventually fizzle out should we expect the U.S. to continue outperforming What other sectors or factors might drive U.S. market growth in the future I ve prepared myself for critical feedback Drag me.,reddit,0.9925,0.12,0.03,0.85,0.29483845829963684,0.021134329959750175,0.6840271949768066,positive,neutral

2024-12-23,Honda and Nissan officially start merger talks Honda and Nissan have officially begun merger talks partially aimed at competing with Tesla and Chinese companies in the ev space. If completed the merger would make the third largest auto company in the world. The two companies currently have an MoU for the proposed merger. The tentative merger deal is looking to close June of 2025. The leadership would be largely decimated by Honda and could include a reciprocal manufacturing agreement to use one another s plants. Nissan has been struggling under heavy debt and lackluster revenue and most recently announced significant layoffs after a 93 profit plunge. Honda can be seeing this as more of an acquisition than a merger as they aim to swoop in and help Nissan achieve a v shaped recovery from their recent downturn. The completed merger could reset the stage for major auto makers and present serious competition for American car companies. Looking forward to watching this develop and see what the impacts will be. Honda does have some U.S. manufacturing but also has plants in Mexico Canada and Japan making discussions of what if any tariffs they could face another piece of the landscape.,reddit,0.3883,0.036,0.024,0.94,0.07050938904285431,0.8345794081687927,0.09491120278835297,positive,negative

2024-12-26,After TSLA Surge Who s Next in the Auto Sector After hedge funds and algorithms inflated TSLA s price in a completely absurd and unjustified manner it was inevitable that this imbalance couldn t persist without consequences. As expected we re now seeing a rebound with Toyota up 10 and Honda surging over 18 in recent days. This shift begs the question who will be next to benefit from the substantial capital inflow into the automotive sector Will historical European automakers like Stellantis BMW Porsche and VW capitalize on the momentum With the growing interest in electric vehicles and the continued push for sustainability these brands could potentially see significant growth in the coming months. The market may have just started shifting and identifying these trends early could provide a solid opportunity for investors.,reddit,0.9501,0.143,0.0,0.857,0.9222735166549683,0.013842951506376266,0.0638834536075592,positive,positive

2024-12-26,NVIDIA s $30 billion net retail buy in in 2024 and when NVIDIA s market cap will overtake Apple s with the rise of artificial intelligence Retail investors bought nearly $30 billion of NVIDIA stock this year through Dec. 17 making it the company with the largest retail inflow this year according to Vanda research data. That s nearly twice as much as the SPDR S P 500 ETF a large cap U.S. stock ETF and is on track to overtake Tesla which will be Retail s Favorite Stock in 2023 Marco Iachini senior vice president of research at Vanda said NVIDIA s stock price has risen so spectacularly that it has stolen the limelight from Tesla. NVIDIA has been favored by investors large and small over the past year or so. Last month NVIDIA officially joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average and was the top performer among the index s 30 components. Despite slightly volatile trading in December NVIDIA is still on track to realize a gain of more than 180 by the end of 2024. Today its market capitalization has surpassed $3 trillion making it the second largest U.S. company by market capitalization behind Apple. NVIDIA s retail investor position has also increased significantly. According to Vanda s data NVIDIA s weighting in retail portfolios has risen from 5.5 earlier this year to more than 10 . Currently NVIDIA is the second largest position for retail investors behind Tesla. This year net inflows of retail money into NVIDIA are up more than 885 from three years ago.,reddit,0.9001,0.06,0.012,0.929,0.9457910060882568,0.01690598390996456,0.03730301931500435,positive,positive
2024-12-26,Why $BROS shouldn t come before hoes A Bear Case DD. Listen up regards ive been going to $BROS since 2017 back when they only had 1 branch in a small college town in Colorado and seen them expand across the entire state over a few years. Yes i know the lines are always long yeah they re competing with starbucks yap yap yeah they got the lisa su of coffee in christine barone as the new CEO but shut it and hear me out. I m gonna tell you why this company is gonna fk up your grandma s inheritance way quicker than you can count to Gee Em EE . If you genuinely bought that stock that shall not be named you should actually buy BROS since you ve likely been donating to the market for years anyway Less Blondes More WTF is that thing that took my order When I first started going to Dutch Bros every morning was basically a softcore caffeine porno. 10 10 baristas smiling at you making your day less miserable before you go back to being a wage cuck at whatever bs remote job you do. Now I show up and I m greeted by some purple haired thing named Skylar. The amount of rainbow employees i ve been seeing at different locations has made me gag If I genuinely wanted a questionable gender fluid experience I d just invest in coins again. Now I just go to $SBUX to get served by underpaid but a cute WOMAN. idc what you say you can t put a P E on no boner no brew. Healthier Options Brain Activity Lost Sales look I go to Dutch Bros because I want 500 grams of sugar in a single gulp. I m not here to think about the caloric content of my caramel macchi whatever the fuck. Studies show that when you force customers to think you lose money. Give me my diabetes in a cup and let me die happy. Also who the fuck buys a protein coffee get a grip . Competition is Thiccker than a Nikola motors truck Expansion is a bitch when you re trying to out coffee Starbucks Dunkin and every bearded hipster in a food truck. You really think $BROS can find prime corners in big cities when SBUX has already claimed every intersection and half the alleyways Good luck with that. They might as well set up shop in the middle of bumfuck iowa at least they ll have a monopoly there. Real Estate From Tiny Shacks to Big Ass Buildings The beauty of Dutch Bros was their huts little shacks that cost roughly the same as an average tiny 3d printed home. Now I m seeing thicker stores with actual indoor outdoor seating meaning sky high overhead. If you re regarded More real estate more capital expenses less margin. you start letting customers inside and guess what They might linger think about what they re buying and worst of all might even realize they can just make their own coffee at home like a finance guru on youtube Expansion Costs Financial Fuckery Yea yea $BROS wants to open 1 500 stores in the next decade. Each new location can cost up to $1M in capex . With an average check size that barely pays your rent or even covers a 3d printed house that s a metric shit ton of $9 coffees just to break even.Meanwhile $SBUX is sitting on every corner flexing their global supply chain and brand recognition. And where are the profits Last quarter $BROS had a net loss of around $16 million while expanding. Their operating margin makes my match rate on hinge look good. Their P S ratio implies theyre the TSLA of coffee but let s face it they can only dream of . To add onto this their new CEO looks more bullish on $MCD than she is on $BROS christin barron if you re reading this sign up for equinox get you some $PTON and maybe ill buy some of your shares. The only bullish thing is that their CEO is a whale meaning she probably buys her own produce TL DR if you hate skinny women love to lose money or both. buy $BROS My Position 5 Puts $25 Strike jan 15 2027 Edit typo i also own 35 shares 10 in my roth and 24 in my main acc $BROS $BROS $SBUX $BROS $BROS $SBUX $BROS $MCD $BROS $PTON $BROS,reddit,-0.9585,0.078,0.091,0.832,0.03684987872838974,0.07367242127656937,0.8894776701927185,negative,neutral

2024-12-28,Tesla s Genius Autonomous Strategy and Implied Supremacy Tesla s autonomous program FSD will inevitably become the prime competitor in the U.S. to Waymo and the leader everywhere else where it is legal. I have this conviction because I can look clearly at the actual comparisons of the vehicles statistics rather than their permit level. The reason that it makes sense to ignore the permit level is that Tesla intentionally declares their autonomous program at Level 2 Autonomy to avoid the increased regulations on testing that Level 3 or Level 4 incur. Essentially what Tesla has seemingly believed from the inception of their FSD program was that more Data better system . And I agree with them. If we look at any machine learning program or deep learning that has aimed to create a high fidelity system most of the time the sheer scale of data has increased output quality immensely . In deploying their FSD to independent owners who supervise it they essentially are able to scale their data collection without hiring and deploying skilled safety testers like Waymo has had to in the past to collect data and train their model giving them a huge leg up in cost efficiency and scalability. People don t realize how good Tesla s FSD because of Autopilot s failures. The rollout of Autopilot and the marketing of it has a lot of criticism for good reason but Full Self Driving may as well be a different system with how markedly different the crash rates between them are. This is also combined with the fact that Waymo vehicles have not operated on freeways while Tesla vehicles have. Waymo only recently began testing on freeways which is quite insane to me because how can anyone believe that Waymo has achieved technological supremacy when they only started testing on freeways a few months ago All of these reasons contribute to my belief that Tesla will achieve Level 5 Autonomy first . . Not only do they actually have a working model of the CyberCab while Waymo does not they also now have the government aligned with them on the federal level that could provide them the ability to create regulatory guidance and permits that could benefit the public s perception and deployment of FSD. You have all of the basic important facts you need to see the likely outcome of the autonomous vehicle landscape but it s up to you to cut through the noise of what news articles write about Tesla s implied supremacy here. Tesla will say it you don t have to believe them because there s people saying otherwise but you have all the details here and the cognitive capacity to ascertain the truth. Good luck.,reddit,0.9769,0.108,0.035,0.857,0.11527873575687408,0.029940854758024216,0.854780375957489,positive,neutral
2024-12-28,Lithium Americas $LAC A High Risk High Reward INVESTMENT Hey folks let s talk about $LAC Why Lithium Matters Lithium isn t just for EV batteries although that s a massive part of its demand. Here s what lithium is used for Electric Vehicles Powers Tesla Rivian and other EVs. Every EV battery needs lithium. Consumer Electronics Think smartphones laptops and even gaming consoles. Energy Storage Lithium ion batteries are essential for renewable energy storage . Aerospace Lightweight lithium batteries for planes and satellites. Medical Uses Lithium is used in pharmaceuticals and medical devices . Industrial Applications Lubricants ceramics glass and even nuclear fusion research. Demand for lithium is expected to grow 25 annually through 2030 as we move toward a greener future. That s where LAC comes in. What s Going Right for LAC 1. The Thacker Pass Project This is the largest known lithium deposit in the U.S. and it s expected to produce 40 000 metric tons year of lithium carbonate in Phase 1 with potential for expansion. LAC recently finalized a joint venture with General Motors in December 2024. GM invested $625 million and now holds a 38 stake ensuring funding and a steady buyer for the lithium. Source Reuters Dec 23 2024 2. DOE Loan Approval The U.S. Department of Energy granted LAC a $2.26 billion loan in October 2024 to fund Thacker Pass. This shows strong government support for domestic lithium production. Source Reuters Oct 28 2024 3. Market Outlook Lithium demand is skyrocketing due to EVs and renewable energy storage. Thacker Pass could be a game changer for the U.S. reducing reliance on foreign lithium from countries like China and Australia. The Numbers Stock Price $3.09 Market Cap $1.5 billion Analyst Ratings Average 12 month price target of $5.06 implying 60 upside. Source Stock Analysis What s the Catch 1. Environmental and Legal Challenges Thacker Pass has faced lawsuits from environmental groups and local tribes. These legal battles could delay production and increase costs. Source BBC News Oct 2024 2. Market Volatility Lithium prices have been unpredictable. If prices dip it could hurt profitability. 3. Dilution Risk LAC is still in its development phase and isn t profitable yet. It might need to issue more shares to raise capital diluting current shareholders. 4. Competition Other players in the lithium space like Albemarle and Piedmont Lithium could overshadow LAC if they scale production faster. Why It s Worth Watching If you believe in the future of EVs renewable energy and tech lithium is the oil of the 21st century.

2024-12-28,AMPX the battery dark horse of 2025 We all know its not just about the tech but timing the investment is crucial. I will use time stamped youtube video links. There is a hype cycle for a new tech The share price roughly follows the amount of hype. Obviously you don t want to buy at the top and become a bag holder. There are so many new battery technologies fortunately a group of German scientists have categorised them according to potential impact and time to market silicon anode batteries are judged to be highly transformative and time to market is less than 2 years AMPX are developing silicon anode batteries. They are developing silicon anode batteries for EV and EVTOLS The science Silicon is good at storing Lithium ions one Silicon atom can store 4 Lithium ions and 24 times more efficient than graphite anodes in use today so it can be more energy dense and light weight compared to existing batteries . The main issues its that the silicon anode will expand a lot. This is mitigated by using silicon nanowires which are deep pores in the silicon which allows the silicon to expand without it being a problem. You can look at the share price chart of AMPX its not in the hype cycle they have factories in the United States they are working with KULR who are working with Space X Archer and Tesla. This isn t financial advice please do you own due diligence.,reddit,0.9805,0.12,0.013,0.867,0.055934399366378784,0.01654140278697014,0.927524209022522,positive,neutral
2024-12-28,How to invest in broad market minus a few stocks Most of my money s in index funds but there are a few stocks that I don t believe are worth paying for. I pretty much want an index fund like VOO minus a few stocks such as APPL TSLA MSTR . Idealy a financial institution would provide a bunch check boxes for each compaany where by default it buys the same fraction of each stock. Essentially I want to create a custom index fund where my custom fund has almost every notable company in the USA or the world. I like being lazy and do not want to buy 500 stocks ever time I get a paycheck. From googling around there are services that offer something called direct indexing but I don t see why buying selling a market proportional ammount should cost 0.4 year. I also do not understand why there would need to be rebalancing since ETFs such as VOO own 5 of everything and buy sell as people buy sell the ETF.,reddit,0.9204,0.098,0.024,0.878,0.0314323715865612,0.14394234120845795,0.8246253132820129,positive,neutral

2024-12-30,The top 5 performing stocks of the past decade have one thing in common The five best performing stocks of the past decade Nvidia AMD Camtek Fair Isaac and Tesla have one thing in common their stock prices have all experienced at least one drop of 50 or more. For example Tesla s stock dropped by more than 70 and Nvidia experienced a 66 decline in 2022. These sharp fluctuations caused many investors to panic and sell. However if we had sold during these major drops we would have missed out on the subsequent huge gains These stocks have had compound annual growth rates ranging from 40 to 75 For instance if you had invested $10 000 in Tesla ten years ago it would now be worth $290 000 and Nvidia return is even more impressive with a $10 000 investment now worth nearly $2.7 million This made me realize that an important investment principle is to let your winners keep winning While there are only a few winners in the market if we can hold on to them in our portfolio the returns can be very significant. However to do this investors need to overcome the fear of large price fluctuations and avoid selling when prices drop It is often only after such fluctuations that these stocks experience the next big rise Investment guru Charlie Munger once said If you can t calmly endure a 50 drop in stock prices two or three times you re not suited to be a common shareholder I have come to understand that market volatility is inevitable and investors must learn to accept significant price swings and remain calm during downturns The key is to have a clear investment thesis when buying stocks understand the company s long term value and compare the company s performance to your judgment. If things are progressing as expected holding on is usually a good idea because it gives you confidence during market turbulence In summary one of the most important investment principles is to continue holding on to the stocks that are performing well even if they experience significant volatility. Volatility is part of the market and only by having strong conviction can we maintain long term returns through market turbulence,reddit,0.9916,0.155,0.04,0.804,0.12467201054096222,0.04958365485072136,0.8257443308830261,positive,neutral

2024-12-31,Why I am optimistic about TANH Tantech Holdings Ltd. listed on NASDAQ produces activated carbon based products and eco friendly technologies including electric vehicles . Here s a quick breakdown of why it might be worth your investment Why Invest in Tantech 1. Diverse and sustainable products Tantech makes products used for water filtration air purification and more. A company that s cleaning water and air Maybe it ll clean up in the market too. 2. Growing presence in the EV market They re focusing on electric commercial vehicles like buses and transport trucks. Not exactly Tesla but hey who doesn t love a good underdog story 3. Rising demand for green tech The world wants sustainability and Tantech is in the right place at the right time. Governments love funding green projects so why not hitch a ride on their budget 4. Access to China s market China s massive EV and green tech market is Tantech s home turf. When your playground is the biggest EV market in the world you ve got at least some room to grow. 5. Affordable stock price It s cheap. Like I ll throw in $50 and see what happens cheap. Remember no risk no reward just don t bet your lunch money. 6. Potential for global expansion If Tantech starts expanding internationally it could turn some heads. Think of it like a penny stock going abroad for the first time kind of like that cousin who just discovered backpacking. Tantech might not be the next big thing but it could surprise you if it capitalizes on the EV and green tech trends. Just remember it s a penny stock so play it smart. This is not financial advice.

2025-01-01,Gains are not worth the risk I wrote this in the hopes of saving some of you future heartache and irreversible trauma. I lost 110k over the past month. The majority after options calls during the bloodbath after december fed meeting. If i could go back to my past self i would say this. The loss isn t worth the potential gains. Before I was just burnt out from my job. But at least i was proud to have saved up my first 100k. Now im burnt out down 3 years of savings and have a lot less freedom in my life. I can t focus on work i m depressed and can t find joy in my hobbies anymore. I m probably in the process of ruining my relationship as well. Even if i had won i definitely don t think I d be happier an equivalent amount. Life is hard. If you worked hard and earned some money. Dont make degenerate bets. The vast majority of us are just normal humans who should just save their time and invest in part index fund and part cash equivalents. Or maybe this marks the bottom and it is a buying opportunity. Your choice. EDIT Was only expecting maybe max 100 upvotes but i guess I said something that resonates. After wading through the comments insults memes etc. I was touched by enough kind people reaching out to add some more. I dont think i can stomach another comment reading though so please dont expect me to react anymore. Notifications are off. Posted a 80k loss screenshot of part of my portfolio. Another 30k was lost in another account. 1. only bet what you can afford to lose doesn t really make sense. Dont use that saying to convince yourself to make risky gambles. I could afford to lose 110k in the sense that i won t starve i would still have a roof over my head and i still have 30k i left that i promised to myself i wouldnt touch. But i lost things i didn t expect. Like my passions for my hobbies a healthy exercise habit my mental health after recovering from depression during college. Even during the time i was trading i also hated how it felt. I was glued to the ticker and was losing connection with real life relationships. Before you use the money you think you are willing to lose. Try spending a part of that amount on yourself. Get yourself some luxuries some experiences maybe travel take a sabbatical from work or spend it on someone close to you. Its all numbers on the screen when trading so its easy to lose a sense of it all. Afterwards imagine losing the ability to do all that and only proceed if youre ok with that. 2. For those who think this isnt something a normal person could go through. I saved roughly 60 70 of my paycheck the past 3 years. I made sacrifices on lifestyle and luxuries. 3. For those that still want to go on i sure cant stop you. Maybe some of us need to learn a lesson firsthand. Might be better even to learn early on before you have a family with hundreds of thousands saved up over decades. This might help. Looking back i definitely had chances to make money. I was thinking about RKLB when it was $5 . I had a chance to jump into RDDT when it was still $80. I considered googl at 165 since the bad news seemed overblown. Even at my most insane already down 50k before i lost it all i almost went all in in on christmas eve with 1 week dte options on tsla calls. Instead i did it on the Friday afterwards hoping for a similar bounce to recover the from the drop after fed earnings. If you get into single stocks crypto options it s a lot riskier. Youre going to have to be lucky with the timing. Youre also going to have to be disciplined with your strategy. When you make your bet. If you win stop. i hope you become happy. I hope you get more time to pursue your passions. To spend time with family and friends. To become a person you are proud of. If you lose i hope you recover. Never gamble again. Life will be harder. But maybe we can still find a part of that happiness. I dont think we really want money. We just want a more human experience.,reddit,0.998,0.183,0.097,0.72,0.0397355742752552,0.3114869296550751,0.648777425289154,positive,neutral

2025-01-01,Airspace Batteries is positioning itself to be the next $KULR Not financial advice. Do your own due diligence before you invest. Congrats to everyone who saw gains from $ABTT on Tuesday. Considering it was a down day for most other stocks I ll happily take a 24 gain. However Airspace Batteries is likely due for at least one more surge in January. With high earnings per share cutting edge tech and large institutional buy in there is a chance this could be the next $KULR. Market Cap $98.2mil Current Price $2.54 52 Week Range $0.81 2.67 1. Recent Developments Has developed a new patented lithium ion battery in 2023 which can store charge 12 better than its competitors. It s now out the research and development phase and the company is now laser focused on securing contracts with several buyers interested. Reported net profit of $0.4 EPS in their latest earnings report which is mind boggling considering they ve been focused on developing their products. Analysts expect this to soar in 2025 and 2026. Partnerships and Acquisitions Interest from the military with a rumoured partnership with a well known carmaker. 2. History and Product Quite a new company as it was founded in 2019 by MIT alumni Jordan Hughes a serial entrepreneur who founded Pop Rocketr before its acquisition for $1.6mil. Hughes was unhappy with the state of electric car batteries and wanted to turbocharge progress so the next generation of batteries could be launched today. Inspired by his wife s pent up rage towards his business ventures Hughes wanted the battery to store an additional 86 charge than Tesla and Duracell batteries. So far results are positive with a single Cheetah outlasting the latter by over 370 . The implications of this are massive as you could charge your phone in twice the speed as a conventional charger. Hughes is hoping to shrink the Cheetah by 10X so it can eventually stand comfortably on your desk. $ABTT raised a staggering $30mil last year when Hughes approached a renown loan shark for capital in exchange for repayment. Sadly not realising the loan shark was connected to the mob Hughes has struggled to repay on time due to the cutting edge research and development costs that come with building a battery. This has resulted in Hughes losing his two best typing figures with analysts predicting double digit losses by 2027 if capital is not repaid. However Hughes remains optimistic that he can repay once his Bitcoin treasury pays dividends . However their main market is electric vehicles. The results are coming in and $ABTT batteries are outperforming their competitors by a country mile One study has found that when fitted in an electric car of your choice the Cheetah battery can outlast the car s lifespan by over 10 years . Critics have argued this is due to the battery shorting the car s circuits rendering it unusable. However Hughes has since successfully made the case in court that you should diversify your car holdings to allow for combustible fuel engines as well. 3. Detailed Financial Analysis and developments Where most companies often struggle turning a profit until their research and development stage is over $ABTT has already started to turn profitable bringing in a whopping $0.4 per share in earnings. There are currently no plans for dilution in the next 6 12 days and analysts are positive that the EPS could even rise to $0.41 next quarter. Airspace Batteries shocked the investing world when they announced a bold plan to create a massive Bitcoin treasury this financial quarter using net cash. Investors have been cautiously optimistic as the company has already allocated funds for a whopping 685 485 Satoshis. Their crypto broker has confirmed this is the maximum amount of Bitcoin you can buy per financial year and Hughes has stated that this justifies spending 68 of their net cash on cryptocurrency and fees. There are already plans next financial quarter to buy the rest of the bitcoin. Institutional investors are now observing whether this bold move will bring big returns but considering the success of other companies with Bitcoin treasuries I think this can only mean good things. Net revenue for the last financial year was $23mil a 90 increase on the financial year before . 4. Growth Drivers for next 5 years. a. The demand for lithium ion batteries is expanding by 18 per year with no signs of stopping . Futurologists are already predicting the end of combustible engine batteries which means there will be a market void to fill. $ABTT is well positioned to get a big slice of that pie. b. With current price indicators remaining bullish on crypto over the next 5 years analysts are confident that the newly established Bitcoin treasury will likely boost revenues by an eye watering $3.6. The C.E.O Jordan Hughes has a great record for promoting his company online and shows no sign of stopping. This has increased visibility in the company by 600 since August last year. He has also made numerous media appearances whilst giving out flyers on Wall Street. This will likely pay dividends in the company s future. 5. Potential Risks Airspace Batteries is a relatively new company so will have difficulty jostling for a bigger slice of the market compared to its competitors. Hughes is a notorious gambler often taking his company s revenue to Vegas each financial quarter and betting it all on the roulette table. This has been a risky strategy but has paid off at least 2 6 times so far. However Hughes is looking to pivot his high risk high reward strategy towards poker. Could more gains be on the horizon Activist investors are unsure about whether to invest money in a company where the mob has a 48 stake in it. However analysts are predicting that with such big institutional buy in that this should ensure stability towards the company s success. It s always worth doing due diligence with a company of this type. In summary $ABTT is a high risk high reward play that could pay big in 2025. As the company is out of its research and development phase with huge institutional buy in Airspace Batteries can now focus on acquiring customers and finally take on big battery.

2025-01-01,Bitcoin Isn t Unique But Infinite $100K Is Beyond Absurd Imagine this air the most abundant and freely available resource on Earth. Everyone can breathe it without restriction it s everywhere and it costs nothing. Now imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles claiming Only 21 million bottles will ever exist. They sell the bottles marketing them as rare and special and soon the price of a single bottle soars to $100 000. But here s the catch anyone can grab the same air bottle it themselves impose their own arbitrary limits and sell it too. The air inside these bottles is identical same purity same ability to sustain life. Yet somehow the original company convinces people their air is unique while the others are dismissed as worthless. This isn t just absurd but comically irrational. And yet it s a perfect analogy for Bitcoin. Think about it bottling air to sell is ridiculous. Why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available Worse imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system one consuming massive amounts of electricity requiring complex networks and involving global participants to package transfer and store this bottled air. This is the level of absurdity we reach with Bitcoin. Bitcoin s defenders often point to its decentralization anonymity and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. But what is this decentralized system really securing Digital air. The units being produced transferred and protected represent nothing they are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. Anyone with the technical knowledge can clone Bitcoin s code impose their own arbitrary cap and launch their own cryptocurrency. This brings us to the critical difference between Bitcoin and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless. Stocks represent ownership in a company. A company cannot be copied like a piece of code. The value of a share is tied to the performance assets and operations of that unique entity. You cannot clone Tesla or Apple and therefore you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. Stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite tied to real world assets operations and innovation. Fiat currencies on the other hand represent units of debt. They are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers companies governments or individuals to repay them. Banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. No one can walk into a bank and request a trillion dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it. Cryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. If you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow nothing stops you. Bitcoin s 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the Bitcoin protocol adjust the parameters and produce trillions of coins in their own system. In this way cryptocurrencies represent nothing no ownership no debt no tangible connection to the real economy. They are the digital equivalent of bottling air infinitely replicable with no inherent value. Bitcoin s defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable likening it to gold. But unlike gold Bitcoin s scarcity is artificial and replicable. Limiting Bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming We re only producing 21 million bottles. The air is still abundant and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits. The absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing transferring and storing these digital tokens. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations and yet what is being protected A digital representation of air something freely available infinitely replicable and ultimately meaningless. Bitcoin s price doesn t reflect the value of its features. If decentralization anonymity and security were truly valuable Bitcoin s clones many of which improve on these features would share its valuation. Instead Bitcoin s price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. People aren t paying $100 000 because Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency they re paying because they believe someone else will pay more. This speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin s features are infinitely replicable and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost the illusion will collapse. Bitcoin isn t digital gold nor is it a revolutionary asset. It s a digital air packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. Paying $100 000 for a single Bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. The elaborate decentralized system supporting Bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost. When the hype fades and the absurdity of the system becomes clear Bitcoin s price will plummet leaving behind the inescapable truth no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.,reddit,0.998,0.163,0.078,0.76,0.02722739987075329,0.09234790503978729,0.8804246783256531,positive,neutral

It doesn t really matter if it was caused by fireworks in the trunk or something else Elon will likely address it somehow. There s a good chance his response will include a statement emphasizing Tesla s commitment to battery safety the fact that their batteries are reliable and even ongoing efforts to improve safety further. My first thought KULR. Even if Elon stays silent the market might still make the connection TSLA safety batteries KULR. These are just my loose thoughts I m not claiming this will definitely happen nor that KULR would be the only beneficiary of such a scenario.

2025-01-02,So keep looking at tech stocks in 2025 Seven giants drove the market rally in 2024 with artificial intelligence chip leader Nvidia soaring 171 for the year and Apple shares rising nearly 31 over the same period. But stocks retreated in the final days of 2024 with the S P 500 ending the year with four consecutive days of losses for the first time since 1966 This basically means that the U.S. stock market this year will not be Santa Claus market . This well known market indicator usually refers to the stock market at the end of the year the last five trading days and the first two trading days of the new year rose. Statistics show that since 1950 the S P 500 has risen an average of 1.3 during this period and has closed higher nearly 80 of the time. The tech led rally in 2024 has raised some concerns about its sustainability but more optimistic investors point to continued economic growth and improved profitability as reasons for the market to continue to rise.

How can I search options that fit a similar profile Got lucky as sold these risky options at the peak of TSLA a few weeks ago. I didn t analyze the Greeks or anything other than seeing that the price would have to go up considerably after an already huge run to lose money. My question is how can I retroactively analyze these to see what the Greeks looked like or what the conditions were that aligned with my intuition. Most likely this was just luck but I d like to get more into option selling to profit from theta vega. These felt like absolutely free money and went positive immediately. My logic was that the stock was up 100 in a month. High vol the company is clearly overvalued and over 1 trillion in market cap. If I were to take major loses on these Tesla would have to add another trillion in market cap in the next few months. I didn t see that happening.

2025-01-04,Why RVSN is THE investment. I do not understand why people ask for a price target. Point prediction is just stupid because no one knows where the price will be in a certain time. Price fluctuations are natural for small cap stocks especially if assaulted by big investors that can easily move the price up down so don t be scared of losses and don t get too excited for gains. This company has potential to grow and I am not the only one believing in this. Let s talk about numbers Revenue Growth 436 y o y . Liquidity Current ratio improved to 4.86 in 2024 from 3.27 in 2023 showing they have the cash to fund growth without immediate risks. Scaling Phase Net losses grew by 316 tied to R D and scaling i.e. typical sign of a company transitioning to higher revenue tiers . Not to mention how their products can be disruptive. RVSN is developing AI powered railway safety systems that have the potential to revolutionize rail transportation 1. Safety First Their technology detects obstacles on railway tracks in real time even in low visibility conditions. This could dramatically reduce accidents saving lives and preventing costly disruptions. 2. Global Adoption Potential Rail safety is a $100B global market with increasing investments in automation and AI driven solutions. RVSN s technology fits perfectly into this growing trend. 3. Market Expansion Opportunities Beyond railways this tech could expand into metro systems industrial automation or even other safety critical industries opening doors to multiple revenue streams. I can reference every single number. Be also aware that the company almost achieved Nasdaq compliance. This will let institutional investors gaining even more confidence... I am holding shares with a long term perspective and I will buy more every time it dips Kisses to everyone.,reddit,0.971,0.164,0.095,0.741,0.8054534196853638,0.01701371558010578,0.1775328516960144,positive,positive

2025-01-04,First 3 months trading options I ve been obsessed with finance and investing for the last year. At first it was a healthy hobby gave me motivation to stimulate my mind and try to learn as much as possible. Then I discovered 0dte SPY calls. Now my investment strategy resolves around buying 0dte SPY calls at open but sometimes I ll do 0dte TSLA call instead. Or if I m feeling really crazy I ll do like 2 week to expiry calls on HOOd or LUNR LOL Oh yeah then there was that time I got drunk and bought some KULR SHARES so regarded. No usually I stick to buying 0dte SPY calls AT OPEN. Buying the calls at open is an important part of the strategy because I m in Australia so when market open it s 1030pm for me and I need to get to sleep at a reasonable hour. Some nights I sit outside smoking a cigarette or joint just looking at the moon. Marvelling at its beauty. Then I see the faint green glow of the SPY chart in my periphery. The light reflects against the lens of my glasses.

2025-01-04,$250 into $2700 in one day Tesla 0 DTE $400 calls... could of been 10k if I hadn t sold any until close. Bought calls around 1 hour after open on the dip. Tesla started coming back and then never really stopped going up. Could have held on for bigger gains as these options closed at $10 aka $1000 had I been a bit more aggressive but profits can disappear very quickly on 0dte options if the stock reverses. First went to $2 and then back down to .65 cents... then rocketed back up to $2 and above. Wish I hadn t sold any early on but who knew Tesla would be up 9 today. Kinda figured Tesla was in for a reversal after it getting smoked for $100 from the ath few weeks ago and then the huge move down yesterday from delivery numbers. But either way got a bit lucky with the overall market going up and didn t worry crazily about the position since it was such a small initial max risk of $250.

2025-01-04,Electrification Is Disrupting The Global Economy. Wolfspeed s SiC Is Among The Best Investments For This Energy Transition. Energy Transition is happening on a massive scale and it s upending traditional energy markets. China is leading the world in electrification which is disrupting large parts of the world economy. Wolfspeed s SiC is one of the best ways to invest in this unstoppable energy revolution. China s forward thinking accomplishments deserve our admiration and gratitude. Their investments are benefiting the entire planet and future technology of society. We need to keep up with their innovation and progress in the most peaceful and mutually beneficial ways possible. China leads in energy generation transmission transportation and storage. Power semiconductors are the main technology where they are still lagging behind. With global adversarial tensions surrounding semiconductor technologies they will be independently produced as much as possible.

Same devices can be used on heat pumps industrial motor drives and induction heating. SiC increases electrical efficiency in all these applications. The intermittent nature of renewables is being addressed with batteries and Energy Storage Systems . Costs continue to plummet with for the world s combustion based energy sources. Doing things cheaper with electricity creates less need to manage tiny explosions and burn resources. helped offset declining vehicle deliveries with some expecting ESS to be the bigger part of TSLA s future.

The The technologies involved in the Energy Transition are a difficult place to invest with all the disruption innovation and competition.

2025-01-04,Is it worth it to invest time into learning technical analysis For context I ve been buying stocks and options since I turned 18 around 3 months ago so I don t have a lot of experience or knowledge in the first place. I ve just been making moves based on my own research combined with other people s ideas. I was looking through a discord where people share their ideas as I wanted to expand my portfolio past being 65 NVDA and 35 random bullshit and I often see these pictures of daily 5 minute candles with countless horizontal diagonal and curvy lines. The poster then mentions various names for some candlestick patterns and says something about how the stock closed above under the EMA or some crap then proceeds to justify their following move seeming to have full confidence because of this chart they drew. So I thought if I could go by the book and use rules and numbers to get a solid guess on which way the stock s gonna go I d be rich. But if it were that easy everyone would be rich. And one look through this r wallstreetbets makes it clear that there s not a lot of people who have achieved that status. I m posting to ask if learning about all this is worth it. I know that the market is unpredictable and there s no way looking at a bunch of lines will give me a positive winrate but does it help For example could you have a better chance at guessing what s gonna happen in the next 30 minutes if you recognized the pattern that came before it I know that I cannot expect the book to be right all the time but would it at least give me a better shot at it I haven t tried this at all and so far I ve been doing fine though I know the stuff I ve bought have been nice to me in the months I ve held it and I can t expect the same in the future . I know reading these patterns won t help in the long run as I m holding shares and am not planning to sell in the foreseeable future but I want to understand what these people are talking about when they do TAs and try it for myself to see if it actually helps or not.

2025-01-04,Arcadium Lithium says shareholders approved Rio Tinto deal Shareholders of Arcadium Lithium have given the green light for a $6.7 billion sale to Australian mining heavyweight Rio Tinto as announced by the company on Monday. This news was met with positivity in the stock market with Arcadium s shares climbing over 2 in after hours trading. However the path to the deal is not without its obstacles. Arcadium is currently dealing with legal challenges from a section of its shareholders. These shareholders have lodged lawsuits against the company accusing it of misrepresentation concealment and negligence in relation to the takeover deal. This information was disclosed by Arcadium in a regulatory filing earlier this month. Earlier in the year Rio Tinto stated its intention to acquire Arcadium at a price of $5.85 per share which was paid in cash. This purchase price represented a nearly 90 premium on Arcadium s closing stock price on October 4 the day a potential deal was first reported by Reuters. The acquisition will grant Rio Tinto access to Arcadium s lithium mines processing facilities and deposits located in Argentina Australia Canada and the United States. Additionally Rio Tinto will also inherit Arcadium s customer base which includes major automotive manufacturers such as Tesla BMW and General Motors .,reddit,0.8564,0.082,0.036,0.882,0.1852455735206604,0.4066636860370636,0.408090740442276,positive,neutral

2025-01-05,What is everyone reading for business stock news So as I learn more about investing I m realizing there are a TON of websites giving different stories on companies etc. What are the top 10 websites that are giving the most trusted accurate information I would like them to be free but I understand some do charge for a subscription nowadays. Next before investing in a company what are we looking at 10Q Trends quarterly reports latest news and once again from what sites I m willing to read 12 hours a day. It s hard for me to determine what s making a stock news based of what information Like why is Warren Buffet in OXY and not Exxon mobile I d like to read and find out but I don t want to waste time of bad news providing websites. Does anyone look at the buys and sells of the day For example I watched Tesla fall about $30 the other day due to a report saying they sold less vehicles. Then the next day skyrocketed past the $30 loss.. How do you know for one the stock would skyrocket past the $30 mark and what trusted websites or news articles did you read when you found out they missed their sales mark Sorry I ask a lot of questions but I don t want to go into this blindly when it comes to buying and selling stocks. I also appreciate all the information about the kiddos I think I ll be going into the 529.,reddit,0.9185,0.115,0.06,0.826,0.037438999861478806,0.07921969890594482,0.8833412528038025,positive,neutral

2025-01-06,Why is trading working out for me I need advice to be better improve No I don t mean one of those people who just started trading 6 months ago and gambled 80 of my money on penny stocked and options and made $10k I ve been trading for 4 years. I m not an expert by any means. But I m actually doing pretty well and I just wanna stay humble because once you start getting too confident you start messing up. I started by dabbling around with a few stocks like Tesla and apple. Then I discovered bitcoin. Slowly got into that and admittedly made most of my money from bitcoin. I worked my ass off investing a lot of my money into bitcoin. THEN I got into stocks. I also got more comfortable with doge coin. I started very little. Making $10 $80 swing trade gains. Getting used to the feeling of losses. Researching stocks. Learning to not panic and try to make my money back when I lose some money. As of now most of my money is in bitcoin and I m okay with that. I ve also played with doge but I stayed really patient. Was down $7k and just waited it out. It was very discouraging. But I stayed patient and I made so much money from bitcoin and doge coin. I started playing with options and thankfully did not get caught up into gambling and losing my money. BUT I started getting more and more into stocks. Researching companies especially AI industry. So I am not stupid enough to just put 80 of my money in penny stocks.y net worst is $120k I am 24 years old. And I ve been investing swing trading penny stocks such as BBAI SERV KULR SOUN and also some NVDA along with holding my bitcoin and holding selling my dogecoin. I am not investing trading these stocks because of hype only. But also because of the company having potential. I only put $10k max into stocks. I ve learned to manage my risk by researching companies especially with CHATGPT. Thinking more before taking a loss or gain. Not putting my self in a position to panic. For example if bitcoin crashes it ll hurt but I won t panic because even though I have a LOT in bitcoin I believe in it. If doge crashes it ll hurt a lot but I didn t put all my money. I might panic a little tbh though lol. With the stocks especially penny stocks even if they all crashed it will hurt a lot but I won t panic because I put less than 10 in stocks I researched the stocks and I diversified my portfolio I ve been making better gains. I m not a good trader. But I ve been taking it slow with stocks. My gains losses for the past 14 months at $6700 gains and $3500 losses. But I ve gotten better at making more profit. Now I have made more around $100 to $1500 profit and got used to losing money. I don t use stop losses because I don t invest enough money to need to panic if they crash. But essentially I ve just learned to not panic and to not put my self in a position to panic and I ve learned to do more research. I ve learned to handle losses be patient and balance patience and learning when to take a loss or gain. I don t have a handbook or anything. But my skill seems to be like it s just intuition at this point which makes me very uncomfortable because it feels like I m lying to my self and will fail soon. All I can say is that I ve learned to not risk all my money in one place understand how much I can put and handle losing without losing my mind diversifying researching BEING PATIENT thinking before taking a loss or gain learn from mistakes of any losses not be crazy and try to make all my money back if I lost any take it slow until my intuition and skills gets better and NOT GAMBLE WITH OPTIONS I d often look and just wonder how in the world people lose 90 of their money and it turns out it s just gambling most your money in risky stocks options penny stocks etc and just trying to get rich quick I m 24 120k$ net worth wanna start a business wanna get better at trading. I m lowkey clueless in a way. I feel smart because I ve made money but I m not smart at all which is why I am asking for advice on how to be an actual successful trader based on my current experience,reddit,-0.7731,0.139,0.143,0.719,0.056799162179231644,0.10496994107961655,0.8382308483123779,negative,neutral

2025-01-06,Mag7 Personal experiment 2024 Hi everyone In 2024 I decided to try a simple but consistent investment experiment I invested 10 per week in the Magnificent 7 . The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice but I can t remember when exactly . This wasn t my only investment and its sole purpose was to see how it would perform over the course of a year. It s not an allocation I plan to keep in the future. Results I invested a total of 520 throughout the year. The current portfolio value is 706.80 which means a profit of 186.80 . Key Takeaways Consistency works Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA for the win Stock selection matters The Magnificent 7 are heavily exposed to the tech sector which had a strong year but that also means higher volatility. Patience is key I didn t touch the investments throughout the year and that was crucial for these results. This was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy. It s just my experience not right not wrong just mine and I wanted to share it with you Discussion Has anyone else here tried investment experiments like this How did it go for you Check the screenshots for the portfolio details if you re curious,reddit,0.9917,0.161,0.024,0.814,0.06381279230117798,0.021182915195822716,0.9150042533874512,positive,neutral
2025-01-06,Tesla s Deliveries Disappoint Time To Take Profits Summary Tesla s stock remains overvalued despite disappointing vehicle delivery numbers and slowing growth. The surge in Tesla s stock price is driven by enthusiasm for AI advancements Elon Musk s charisma and Donald Trump s election victory rather than improvements in the company s core business fundamentals. At 126 times projected earnings Tesla s valuation is far higher than both industry peers and even Nvidia making it increasingly difficult to justify its current price. The company s challenges including declining deliveries suggest that much of its upside potential has already been priced in. Investors should consider taking profits while the stock is trading at near record highs. Tesla s stock has been riding a wave of unprecedented enthusiasm with its price reaching all time highs despite recently published delivery numbers that fell short of analysts expectations. This discrepancy highlights a growing disconnect between Tesla s market valuation and its actual performance. The company once known for its relentless growth and innovation delivered fewer cars in 2024 than in 2023 marking its first ever year of declining deliveries. Despite this Tesla s stock price has surged by 63 in 2024 demonstrating how much investor sentiment rather than fundamental growth is driving its valuation. In my October analysis I discussed how Tesla s slowing delivery growth and declining net income despite aggressive price cuts were becoming evident concerns. Even the highly anticipated robotaxi event failed to deliver the excitement that investors had hoped for leading to a drop in the stock price at the time. While Tesla was already trading at a premium then its valuation has only become more stretched in the months since. The most recent data on Tesla s deliveries reveals troubling trends. In the fourth quarter of 2024 the company delivered 495 570 vehicles falling short of the 512 300 deliveries expected by analysts. This shortfall contributed to a total of 1.79 million vehicles delivered for the year a slight decline from the 1.81 million delivered in 2023. While the drop in deliveries may seem modest it is significant as it breaks Tesla s streak of consistent year over year growth which had previously been a hallmark of its success. This is especially notable given the company s reliance on vehicle sales for approximately 80 of its revenue. Without sustained growth in this area the rationale for holding Tesla as a growth stock diminishes considerably. From 2020 to 2023 Tesla experienced remarkable growth in deliveries with annual numbers climbing steadily. However 2024 marked a departure from this trend with sales stagnating and then declining. Quarterly delivery figures also highlight the slowdown with growth peaking in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently stalling. This lack of growth is especially concerning for a company that reinvests all earnings into future expansion rather than paying dividends to shareholders. Tesla s business model hinges on its ability to grow continuously and the absence of that growth undermines its investment appeal. Despite these challenges Tesla s stock has soared buoyed by investor excitement over its advancements in artificial intelligence Elon Musk s magnetic persona and the political implications of Donald Trump s recent election victory. Musk has repeatedly emphasized Tesla s position as a leader in AI and robotics which has further fueled optimism among investors. Additionally Tesla s stock experienced significant gains following the November election with investors speculating that Trump s administration might ease regulations related to self driving technology. However such regulatory changes would only be beneficial if Tesla achieves full autonomy an ambitious milestone that remains elusive. Tesla s valuation underscores the risks of the current enthusiasm. The stock is now trading at an extraordinary 126 times projected earnings a multiple that far exceeds even AI powerhouse Nvidia which trades at around 42 times earnings. Comparisons with legacy automakers further highlight the disparity. Tesla s market cap of $1.2 trillion is greater than that of the next 20 largest automakers combined yet it delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than in 2023. This disconnect raises questions about whether Tesla s valuation can be justified in the absence of tangible growth. Tesla s performance relative to Nvidia provides another perspective on the stock s overvaluation. While both companies have benefited from their association with AI Tesla s stock has outperformed Nvidia s despite facing significant headwinds in its core business. This suggests that investor enthusiasm for Tesla may be outpacing its actual achievements. Although Tesla remains a leader in EV production and is recognized for its innovative technologies including AI and robotics these factors are already priced into the stock. The company s market leadership positions it well to benefit from long term trends in EV adoption but its challenges in the short term including declining deliveries and uncertain profitability from new ventures make its current valuation appear precarious. In conclusion Tesla s stock is trading at unsustainable levels given its recent performance. While the company s technological advancements and market leadership are undeniable its reliance on investor sentiment rather than business fundamentals makes it a risky investment at these prices. Taking profits now would allow investors to capitalize on the stock s near record highs while avoiding potential losses should the market reassess Tesla s valuation. While the enthusiasm surrounding Tesla may persist in the short term prudence suggests that this is an opportune moment to exit the position.,reddit,0.9922,0.104,0.036,0.86,0.03542156517505646,0.9434007406234741,0.021177735179662704,positive,negative

2025-01-06,WOLF Oversold Chipmaker Ready to Explode Due to Massive Capacity Increase WOLF is uniquely positioned as a global leader in silicon carbide and gallium nitride technologies which are critical for high performance energy efficient power and RF solutions. The company s strategic focus on markets undergoing rapid electrification including EVs renewable energy and industrial applications positions it to capitalize on secular growth trends. With a robust pipeline of customer contracts significant capacity expansion plans and strong R D capabilities Wolfspeed is set to deliver sustained revenue and margin growth over the long term. Key Catalysts for Growth 1. Leadership in Silicon Carbide Technology Wolfspeed has established itself as a pioneer in SiC semiconductor manufacturing an essential material for high efficiency power applications. SiC adoption is expected to accelerate as industries prioritize energy efficiency and performance giving Wolfspeed a durable competitive advantage. 2. Electric Vehicle Market Expansion The global EV market is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 20 through 2030. Wolfspeed s SiC components enable higher efficiency and range in EVs making the company a key supplier to leading automakers. Recent multi year supply agreements with major EV manufacturers including Tesla underscore its pivotal role in this ecosystem. 3. Mohawk Valley Fab Ramp Up The Mohawk Valley Fab Wolfspeed s state of the art SiC facility has begun operations and is expected to increase production capacity significantly. This will support the company s ability to meet surging demand and scale revenues. 4. Secular Trends in Renewable Energy As the world transitions to renewable energy sources SiC s superior efficiency makes it indispensable for applications in solar inverters wind turbines and energy storage systems. Wolfspeed s solutions align perfectly with these trends opening new avenues for growth. 5. R D and Technological Innovation Wolfspeed s continued investment in R D ensures that it remains at the forefront of innovation enabling the development of next generation SiC and GaN solutions that will drive future growth. 6. Potential for a Short Squeeze Wolfspeed has very high short interest currently at 30.14 of its float. If positive developments such as stronger than expected earnings or favorable industry news were to materialize it could trigger a short squeeze. Investors should consider this dynamic as a potential accelerant to Wolfspeed s already strong growth narrative. 7. Primed for a Rebound Wolfspeed s stock has been under significant pressure in recent months with its valuation beaten down due to macroeconomic concerns and temporary operational challenges. However the company s underlying fundamentals remain strong and any positive news such as improved earnings increased EV adoption or successful capacity ramp ups could serve as a catalyst for a sharp rebound. Given its leadership position and strategic importance in high growth markets the stock is primed to take off as sentiment shifts positively. Financial Overview Revenue Growth Wolfspeed delivered revenue growth of 36 year over year in the most recent quarter driven by strong demand across EV and industrial markets. Gross Margins While current gross margins are under pressure due to capacity expansion costs I expect margins to improve as the Mohawk Valley Fab reaches optimal utilization. Long Term Contracts Wolfspeed s $3 billion order backlog provides clear visibility into future revenue streams. Balance Sheet Strength The company maintains a solid cash position enabling it to fund expansion and innovation initiatives. It was also the recipient of $750MM from the CHIPS Act. Valuation My price target of $14.72 is based on a forward P S multiple of 2.3x reflecting Wolfspeed s premium positioning in high growth markets and robust earnings potential.,reddit,0.9992,0.243,0.026,0.731,0.8808122873306274,0.0127088138833642,0.10647885501384735,positive,positive

2025-01-06,The current U.S. stock market valuation has reached 2000 and 2021 levels. Will this time be different Three different U.S. stock market valuation models are flashing extreme overvaluation warning signs that were both last seen in 2000 and 2021. Both 2000 and 2021 marked market euphoria highs and bear markets followed. You can make all your jokes that you want about gay bears successfully calling 420 of the last 69 recessions or what not but the undeniable fact is that the track record of these three valuation models showing strongly overvalued in unison is 2 for 2 in calling bear markets that followed very quickly. Will history repeat itself again Or is this time different There is also a fourth model the Interest Rate Model which measures S P 500 valuation relative to current 10 year treasury rate. It hasn t quite hit the strongly overvalued line but it is pretty close to it. Two recession risk models Yield Curve Inversion and the Sahm Rule may be signaling a rough time as well. There is also the Fed Funds Rate. It is showing a similar setup to previous cycles of rate hikes followed by rate holds followed by rate cuts followed by recession. The current setup looks similar to 2007 2008 especially. Will the recession or bear market be cancelled this time with mission accomplished soft landing achieved Here is the inflation adjusted S P 500 on a log scale chart. It has historically gone through a series of hot periods where the market beats inflation for roughly 15 years followed by cold periods where the market loses to inflation that last 10 years . The magnitude and time length of the current hot period looks like it could be giving way to a cold period soon if the overall historical cycle is followed. Last but not least I ll list a few informal Can t you just feel it it in the room type blow off top indicators of a potential market top 1. Tesla stock doubled in price in like 1 2 months on shallow narratives not backed by numbers. An insane $750 billion market cap to an even more insane $1.5 trillion market cap in 1 2 months on a company earning roughly $13 billion annually and not growing much anymore. Ludicrous. Earnings have not exploded in line with stock price not nearly at all. I don t care what you TSLA lovers say your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth. 2. Palantir stock also doubled in price in like 1 2 months also on shallow narratives not backed by numbers. Roughly $100 billion to $180 billion market cap with a price to SALES ratio going from an insane 30x to an even more insane 67x. Ludicrous. And I don t care what you PLTR lovers say your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth. 3. 4. Just the mentality of too many market participants buying ponzi scheme like assets or money burning trash companies at all in general often knowingly. Like seriously why is this even a thing What the fuck is wrong with this market This shouldn t be happening... like at all. 5. The great momentum chase of 2024. The theme of the year was to just bid up and crowd into the most popular meme like line go up assets regardless of fundamentals. It went into over drive in November December to the point of self parody. It has a very end stage bull market feeling to it. 6. The great AI hype. Does the potential future of AI justify many of these extreme valuations Maybe but I m not convinced that there s much upside left near term. The only companies making serious money from this so far are Nvidia and the handful of companies selling the AI hardware to other companies that are speculating on it. And the once rapid progression in generative AI chatbots picture generators and video generators seen in 2023 and early 2024 seems to have slowed and hit a bit of a wall in the second half of 2024. TL DR All the warning signs of extreme overvaluation and an incoming bear market are there. Unlike most other gay bear posts that usually just show one warning sign chart to make a case I showed you multiple charts along with multiple observations. Whether you choose to ignore them or not depends on how long you think the market will choose to ignore them or not. Positions Bent over a table. Puts on TSLA PLTR MSTR and some other 2024 momentum clown stocks for 2025. Contemplating whether to inverse or to inverse my inverse. Update 1 7 Pre market I have taken down the screenshot of my tentative positions from 1 6 because I will be closing some of them and changing some things around. For archival purposes you may view my original 1 6 positions Update 1 6 7 00PM EST Cramer on his closing segment on Mad Money just said I think Palantir and Tesla stock are DEFINITELY going higher. Take that for what you will. I know the meme is to inverse Cramer but he does end up being right short term a number of times so it doesn t really make me any more confident in my puts.,reddit,0.9845,0.119,0.09,0.791,0.05575624480843544,0.08672100305557251,0.85752272605896,positive,neutral

2025-01-06,New Volkswagen Leaks Alright degenerates strap in because this is why Volkswagen might just be the juiciest short of 2025. Spoiler alert this makes Dieselgate look like a warmup. My Position Just opened a 0 4 Delta 80 put on Volkswagen for 5000 expiring 19th June 26. The Chaos Computer Club just just revealed that Volkswagen exposed the real time locations of 800 000 EVs . That s right anyone with basic skills could pinpoint where your $40k EV is parked plus grab your name and contact info. VW literally left their cars and customers wide open for anyone to exploit. Volkswagen s software arm Cariad stored all this sensitive data on Amazon Web Services without proper encryption or safeguards. Let me say that again no encryption in 2025. That s amateur hour for a company that sells millions of cars. Oh and this isn t the first time VW screwed the pooch on tech their software track record is garbage. Here is the link to their video Why This Is Bigger Than Dieselgate Dieselgate cost Volkswagen over $30 billion in fines lawsuits and buybacks. But that was emissions . This This is personal data names locations potential stalking targets and members of the BND. We re living in the post GDPR era where the EU doesn t play nice with data breaches. Fines for mishandling data can be as high as 4 of annual global turnover which for VW could mean billions. Plus the reputational damage. There has not yet been a Market reaction to the release of this video. Also want to give you some reasons why you should not take my advice and short VW Volkswagen is the biggest EV player in Europe with about 25 market share. European people don t trust Chinese vehicles and they don t trust Elon Musk. VW is grossly undervalued compared to Tesla. We re talking 44 billion market cap vs. 1 279 billion for Tesla. VW currently earns those 44 billion every four years. CCC did responsible disclosure and VW already fixed the breach. It will be hard to prove harm done to you. The German state is highly invested in VW EU regulations require automakers to collect and process vast amounts of data to comply with emissions standards safety protocols and EV monitoring. The breach highlights shortcomings but some responsibility lies with the regulatory framework.

2025-01-06,Mag7 Personal experiment 2024 Hi everyone In 2024 I decided to try a simple but consistent investment experiment I invested 10 per week in the Magnificent 7 . The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice but I can t remember when exactly . This wasn t my only investment and its sole purpose was to see how it would perform over the course of a year. It s not an allocation I plan to keep in the future. Results I invested a total of 520 throughout the year. The current portfolio value is 706.80 which means a profit of 186.80 . Key Takeaways Consistency works Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA for the win Stock selection matters The Magnificent 7 are heavily exposed to the tech sector which had a strong year but that also means higher volatility. Patience is key I didn t touch the investments throughout the year and that was crucial for these results. This was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy. It s just my experience not right not wrong just mine and I wanted to share it with you Discussion Has anyone else here tried investment experiments like this How did it go for you Check the screenshots for the portfolio details if you re curious,reddit,0.9917,0.161,0.024,0.814,0.06381279230117798,0.021182915195822716,0.9150042533874512,positive,neutral

2025-01-07,$XBOT AT CES TOMORROW Realbotix Shares 2025 Outlook LAS VEGAS NEVADA December 19 2024 Realbotix Corp. Realbotix or the Company a leading creator of humanoid robots and companionship based AI is pleased to share its 2025 business outlook underscoring confidence in its companionship product advancements AI development initiatives and cryptocurrency holdings. 2024 had many changes including an expansion into AI and robotics a name change and a rebrand said Andrew Kiguel CEO. We re pleased to see our crypto strategy paying off and are confident that our ventures in AI and robotics will provide for meaningful shareholder value in 2025. 2025 Capital Markets Initiatives Realbotix remains well capitalized and management does not foresee the need to raise capital in 2025. In addition management does not feel the current share price fully reflects the value of its business. As a result Realbotix will allocate a portion of its capital in Q1 to its Normal Course Issuer Bid announced in October to buy back its common shares if they remain at current levels. At the current common share prices the Company s cash and cash equivalents represents over 50 of its market capitalization. Realbotix has a September financial year end and is currently finalizing its audited financial statements for 2024. It is anticipated that the Company will release its audited statements approximately in the third week of January and within regulatory timelines. Cryptocurrency Treasury Strategy Realbotix remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency market. While the company continues to stake approximately 60 of its owned ETH the other approximately 40 of its ETH holdings are unstaked to allow for opportunistic selling in anticipation of a further bullish pricing environment. In December Realbotix sold 100 ETH for working capital purposes. The Company s remaining crypto holdings have appreciated by 173 since our previous fiscal year ended October 1st 2023. Realbotix may explore additional purchases or sales of cryptocurrency. The company currently holds approximately 2880 ETH alongside other digital assets and is owed approximately 10 333 SOL and 84 ETH from Genesis. Genesis has communicated to the Company that further distributions will occur before the end of 2024. Management is confident it will recover the majority of the remaining assets from Genesis. The current value of Realbotix s self custodied cryptocurrency and holdings those held at Genesis have a gross value of approximately US$ 13.77M US$ 2.5M held at Genesis or CDN$ 19.73M. As disclosed previously Genesis Global Trading is undergoing a restructuring. As a result some of those holdings may not be recovered. We note these figures do not include Realbotix s cash holdings. At current market values this represents over 50 of the Company s market capitalization. 2025 Robotic and AI Marketing Initiatives With the launch of the new consumer website Realbotix.com the company enters 2025 with a focus on sales and marketing strategy. Plans include hiring sales people and scaling operations to meet demand. Realbotix has been the beneficiary of significant positive media coverage in 2024 and anticipates this momentum to grow as its robot lineup expands in the coming year. The AI and robotics market is on a significant upward trajectory. Elon Musk recently estimated that humanoid robots could become a multi trillion dollar industry1 further validating Realbotix s innovative product strategy and growth potential. 1 t said tesla has a 200 trillion opportunity in front of it heres what it would take to get there Our goal is to become a significant player in the humanoid robotics market. Although the market and our products are at early stages our robots are available now for purchase said Andrew Kiguel CEO of Realbotix. Our next iteration of companionship and social AI is nearing completion. We believe our products have numerous use cases including tackling the loneliness epidemic which is estimated to impact as high as 50 of US citizens2 . As one of the only providers of robotic hardware and AI software that integrates to address this area of healthcare management feels confident in our ability to successfully grow. Realbotix continues to distinguish itself from other AI companies by offering deeply integrated hardware and software solutions that focus on human like connection creating what management believes to be the most realistic AI powered robots on the market. Management intends to make further investments into marketing and sales with the goal of increasing its revenue pipeline. This would take the form of hiring additional sales support personnel and investing in further marketing such as attending trade shows and other forms of advertising. 2025 AI and Hardware Development The development of Realbotix s next generation companionship AI remains a core focus with key partnerships driving progress. Supported by Compass and a grant from Amazon Web Services the company is advancing its unique emotional AI platform which prioritizes unfiltered emotionally driven conversations over traditional task based AI models. Additionally the Robot Controller 3.0 currently under development represents a large upgrade in the functionality and AI of Realbotix s humanoid robotics. With improved motors speech capabilities it delivers high levels of fluidity and realism in movement. In addition it leverages our proprietary AI technologies to bring smarter more intuitive interactions to life setting new standards in robotic innovation. 2 Domain Name Sales Management plans to be more assertive in 2025 with respect to selling certain domain names including Tokens.com. The Tokens.com landing page has been converted to a sales site with that domain listed at US$6 million. Management notes the domain is not valued on its balance sheet and any sales would be incremental to the balance sheet asset values. Consumer Electronics Show 2025 Realbotix is excited to showcase its cutting edge products at the Consumer Electronics Show being held January 7th 10th 2025. Realbotix will be located at booth 9468 and will be unveiling its new robot to further solidify its presence as a leader in AI powered companionship robots.

2025-01-07,Shares of Tencent fall 5 in Hong Kong after U.S. adds firm to list of Chinese military companies Shares of Chinese tech heavyweight Tencent Holdings tumbled 7 in Hong Kong after the company was added to a list of Chinese military companies by the U.S. Department of Defense. The move follows a near 8 fall in Tencent s U.S. depository receipts on Wall Street. Other Chinese companies added to the list included battery maker CATL which is part of the supply chain for automakers such as Ford and Tesla. CATL shares which fell as much as 5.6 were last down 2.8 in Shenzhen. The National Defence Authorization Act of 2024 says that the DoD will be prohibited from procuring goods or services directly from entities on the list in June 2026 and indirectly from June 2027. In response to the decision Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was clearly a mistake. We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls this listing has no impact on our business the company added. CATL also called the designation a mistake in a response saying it is not engaged in any military related activities. The U.S. has taken aim at Chinese tech companies in its bid to restrict transfer of high end technologies to China. Last year it revoked certain licenses to sell chips to China s Huawei in May and unveiling new sweeping export controls on critical technologies in September including quantum computing and semiconductor goods. In 2022 the U.S. Department of Commerce s Bureau of Industry and Security said companies must apply for a license if they want to sell certain advanced computing semiconductors or related manufacturing equipment to China.

2025-01-07,This is why we dont buy Chinese stocks US Dept of Defense Labels Tencent a military company From The U.S. Department of Defense has added Tencent Holdings and CATL to its blacklist of companies allegedly linked to China s military causing Tencent s U.S. listed shares to drop nearly 10 . This move is part of the Pentagon s Section 1260H list which now names 134 firms believed to support China s military civil fusion strategy where civilian tech is leveraged for military purposes. Tencent known for WeChat and major gaming investments has denied the allegations and plans to work with U.S. authorities to clear up what it calls a misunderstanding. Similarly CATL a key supplier of EV batteries to Tesla Ford and BMW refuted the claims calling their inclusion a mistake and stating they have no involvement in military activities. While the designation doesn t impose immediate sanctions it signals increased risk for U.S. investors and partners. Companies previously added to this list like DJI have faced serious business disruptions including bans and reputational hits. Both Tencent and CATL are expected to challenge the decision but this adds to the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. Investors should keep an eye on this situation as it could impact these stocks and broader U.S. China market relations.,reddit,-0.7227,0.053,0.079,0.868,0.009871185757219791,0.9629948735237122,0.027133991941809654,negative,negative

2025-01-07,Uber A Great Buying Opportunity In Current Markets Summary Uber s stock is currently undervalued due to market fears surrounding autonomous vehicles but its robust fundamentals and durable business model make it a highly appealing investment. Key strengths include an extensive urban mobility database loyal user base and diversified sources of revenue. While the rise of self driving technology presents certain risks Uber s strategic alliances regulatory challenges for competitors and market dominance ensure it remains well positioned for sustained growth. Even cautious revenue and margin projections suggest considerable upside potential making Uber an attractive choice with a strong margin of safety. The Impact of Market Narratives on Uber s Perception Recent announcements have reignited interest in autonomous driving. Tesla revealed plans to launch the Cybercab by 2027 while Google s Waymo announced expansion into Miami. These updates have led to a nearly 10 drop in Uber s stock contributing to a 15 decline over the past month. This situation is reminiscent of past market narratives that impacted companies like Google and Meta . Both experienced temporary valuation drops due to overblown concerns but ultimately delivered strong returns supported by solid fundamentals and competent management. Uber continues to showcase impressive operational growth strong cash flow and consistent profitability all while trading at historically low P E multiples. These attributes combined with its moat driven business model position Uber as a promising portfolio addition. Uber s Competitive Moats and the Importance of Strategic Management Uber s advantages go beyond its network effects. Its unmatched urban mobility database allows for optimized routing pricing and seamless connections between users and drivers. Additionally features like loyalty programs subscriptions and brand trust further enhance its competitive position in a sector where reliability and safety are crucial. Diversification is another critical element in reducing risk. Similar to Google s evolution beyond search Uber has created a multifaceted platform that includes logistics and transportation. Delivery accounted for 30 of revenue in Q3 while freight contributed 11 generating $1.3 billion despite not yet achieving positive EBITDA margins. These emerging segments have the potential to become significant revenue drivers in the future. Furthermore Uber s investments in companies like Grab and DiDi reflect a strategic approach to balancing profitability and competition. These equity stakes act as a form of optionality while demonstrating Uber s ability to focus on long term gains in key regions. Uber s management has shown remarkable capability in adapting to industry changes. Much like Meta s successful redirection of investments Uber is already positioning itself for the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Partnerships with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta exemplify its ability to integrate self driving technology while retaining its platform leadership. Adapting to Regulations and Long Term Mobility Trends The adoption of self driving vehicles faces significant hurdles including regulatory and infrastructure challenges particularly in emerging markets that are critical to Uber s business. While major cities like Los Angeles and Miami may adopt autonomous technology sooner broader implementation is likely to take years especially in regions such as Brazil India and Mexico. In addition overarching trends in urban mobility including cost savings easing traffic congestion and the shift from ownership to access support Uber s long term growth. Although the global ride hailing market is already substantial it remains underpenetrated in numerous regions providing opportunities for continued expansion. Uber s Resilience Shines Even in Pessimistic Scenarios While autonomous vehicles pose potential risks competition from local apps and evolving regulations may present more immediate challenges to Uber s margins and market share. Nonetheless analysts project Uber s EPS to reach $4 by 2027 and $4.80 by 2028 resulting in P E multiples of 15x and 12.8x respectively. Even under conservative assumptions Uber s revenue could exceed $74 billion by 2030 with margins reaching 11.5 . In a more optimistic outlook margins of 17 would result in a P E multiple around 10x equating to an earnings yield of 10 a compelling figure for a leader in a growing market. Uber s forward P E and free cash flow multiples of 21.9x remain attractive given its growth trajectory and low current valuations. With management forecasting strong EBITDA growth and robust free cash flow conversion Uber offers significant upside even if its market valuation remains steady. TLDR Uber s long term outlook remains favorable despite concerns over disruption from self driving technology. Its diversified operations strategic investments and adaptability effectively mitigate potential risks. At its current valuation Uber represents a strong investment opportunity with substantial potential for long term shareholder returns.

2025-01-07,The potential AI stocks in 2025 When think of AI stocks the first names that come to my mind is $NVDA and $MSFT. NVIDIA dominates the AI hardware market with its GPU technology while Microsoft through its partnership with OpenAI has become a benchmark in the AI software space. Meanwhile Applovin has excelled in AI driven advertising with its stock price doubling in November attracting widespread attention. But beyond these giants there are still many hidden champions lurking among the small cap stocks. For example $BBAI which focuses on defense AI and UiPath specializing in enterprise automation have garnered attention from the capital markets due to their deep market positioning. But I am currently eyeing on $BGM s recent stock price fluctuations. Recently BGM completed its acquisition of AIFU s insurance platform marking a significant step in its transformation into the AI insurance sector. AIFU s DuXiaoBao platform powered by Baidu s big data is a prime example of such integration. It combines Baidu s 704 million monthly active users with AIFU s 48 million insurance sales network. Currently the platform covers over 16.8 million customers and 17.5 million households. With BGM s integration of medical resources the user base and insurance coverage are expected to expand significantly driving explosive growth for the company. Traditional insurance sales rely on broker networks but DuXiaoBao is changing the game by using Baidu and AIFU s deep data models to offer tailored insurance solutions. In the future it might even analyze users lifestyle and health data to predict their health risks over the next 30 years and design personalized insurance products based on that. Imagine if AI told you there was a 95 chance you d be sick in the next 20 30 years and recommended an insurance product accordingly would you buy it This smart privacy insurance sales model is truly disruptive. This approach bears a striking similarity to Tesla s innovation Tesla used vehicle data to personalize car insurance disrupting the traditional auto insurance industry while BGM is using big data to empower insurance products revolutionizing the customer experience. Looking ahead BGM might even leverage OpenAI s technology to take the DuXiaoBao platform global offering personalized health and insurance services to users worldwide. This vision of globalization and technological integration opens up even greater growth potential for the company. BGM s market cap is currently just around $60 million compared to insurance giants like Prudential and Prudential Financial which are dozens of times its size.

2025-01-08,Contrarian Alert Uber s Missing the AI Wave Yet It s a Buy After Travis Kalanick got ousted Dara Khosrowshahi stepped in and turned Uber from a wartime to a peacetime company. He cleaned up the culture mess shoved aside long term moonshots and put the company on a strict path to profitability . Despite getting smacked by COVID and high interest rates Uber tightened its belt doubled down on demand supply matchmaking and came out profitable. Wall Street went nuts. Uber is now FCF positive and aiming for even higher margins. So what is Uber today Dara says they re laser focused on nailing that perfect supply demand match. Sure they re winning in mobility and they might tackle new verticals like Fiverr style marketplaces. Sounds great except they re missing out on the biggest opportunity of our era which motherfucking AI Uber collects 11B trips a year from 160M users racking up insane amounts of data . This could ve made them a self driving powerhouse. But they ditched their autonomous unit in 2020 to cut costs just as NVIDIA s Jensen Huang now shows off new automotive processors and partnerships with Toyota Aurora and Volvo. Uber s name is nowhere on that list No matter how you spin it a simple supply demand marketplace could get overshadowed once autonomous vehicles go mainstream. Especially when you already own the infrastructure for ride hailing food delivery scooters and bikes. Activist investors might be licking their chops at two big plays 1. Pull a Reddit Sell anonymized data for LLM training and get lots of money further increasing margins. Instantly Uber gets an AI play. 2. Sell to Tesla or Google Supercharge someone else s AV ambitions and get a fat premium in the process. Meanwhile the stock still looks undervalued. Uber s LTM P FCF is around 22.6x PEG is under 1.0x and a Reverse DCF suggests they only need 9.2 revenue growth over 10 years to justify the current price. That s totally doable. Here s how I see it playing out 1. Best case Tesla or Google acquires them this year and we get a solid premium payday. Probably a stock deal but it s still peanuts compared to Tesla and Google market caps 2. Second best Uber pivots to selling AI training data 3. Not bad either Uber dominates more human driven marketplaces 4. Base scenario They stick to mobility keep expanding margins and maybe bolt on third party AVs At current valuations there s enough margin of safety for me. I m buying in and watching these scenarios unfold.,reddit,0.9911,0.127,0.04,0.833,0.2210538238286972,0.021722258999943733,0.757223904132843,positive,neutral

Why Weather Proof AF LiDAR struggles in rain snow but Arbe s radar doesn t flinch. Longer Range Great for big rigs and fleets. Cheaper and Stronger LiDAR s overpriced and fragile this radar tech is built for the grind. Not Perfect Sure it doesn t have LiDAR s resolution in ideal conditions but in the real world this wins. Now imagine fleets of commercial trucks or robotaxis running on this stuff. Tesla hates LiDAR and won t touch it this tech fits right into their cheaper faster better vibe. Feels like Arbe could land some juicy partnerships down the line. About That NVIDIA Collab Did some digging. Arbe says they re working with NVIDIA on their DRIVE platform. Jensen didn t name drop them at CES but he did mention partnerships focused on AI for autonomous vehicles. Could be legit could be Arbe trying to flex. Either way it s on the radar . The cons Let s be real Arbe s revenue is barely scraping six figures and they re burning cash faster than a YOLO options trade. Manufacturing is still in baby steps and if they can t scale up someone else will eat their lunch. Plus negative gross profit C mon at least pretend to make money. My Play In for 2 000 shares at $4.47. Waiting for news that Arbe s cranking out chips and landing deals. If this tech takes off it s game over for LiDAR in fleets.

2025-01-10,DD BeammWave a paradigm shift in wireless communication Good day to all of you this is a deep dive into a a real sleeper Enter BeammWave who s innovation will likely underpin a great chunk of wireless communication in the future. This will be a lengthy one so hang on but what s five minutes of reading for early retirement in a couple of years eh Ticker BEAMMW.B or BEAMMW B Current Price 5 25 SEK $0.50 USD Market Cap $15.7M USD Industry wireless communication The TL DR They have a technology that literally everyone in the mobile industry and beyond will need to be able to compete in the higher radio frequencies Their solution is superior to anything out there today faster smaller and more energy efficient at an affordable price point Competition to what they do is basically zero with extremely high barriers of entry due to a literal minefield of patents that they own Their tech fits in smartphones routers base stations you name it it will fit They have the absolute dream team working on this Applications range from mobile base stations CPE operators satellite self driving cars military radar etc. the possibilities are endless as long as data needs to be transmitted wirelessly This is a recipe for TSLA levels of success. Who are they BeammWave is a Swedish tech company developing and industrializing a technology called digital distributed beamforming which makes wireless data transfer significantly faster and more efficient and solves the looming issue of bandwidth running out on the frequencies in use today. It s the sorely missing key for the mobile industry to utilize higher radio frequencies at scale something all the big players are frothing at their mouths to get at. Their key product is a compact and affordable chip system with fully integrated antennas enabling reliable wireless communication on the mmWave spectrum without the bulk and subpar performance of the solutions in use today. Last summer they became the world first to showcase an over the air demo of digital distributed beamforming and having protected their solution with over 40 patents so far they aim to own the entire market ok apples to oranges since Bluetooth is a protocol and distributed digital beamforming is a technical solution but the common factor is both represent a paradigm shift in the industry something that everyone will need to adopt to be competitive How are they pulling it off For being a small company in such a daunting industry they have some serious talent behind them the team consists of telecom industry OG s several of them having held key roles in developing bluetooth in the 90 s and leading development of 5G at some of the biggest firms in the telecom industry one of their engineers holding over 2000 patents to his name alone. These guys garner a lot of respect in the industry and due to that they ve had access to discuss their idea with all the big players for years already. As the CEO Stefan Svedberg himself says everybody who s anybody in the industry knows who BeammWave are and what they are working on. Their personal merits have awarded them opportunities to work directly with chip manufacturers who normally don t do prototyping for small startups and gain access to special tooling and materials usually reserved for the big guys. They also have a company member inside the organization for mobile broadband network standarization 3GPP with significant influence there and they obviously aim to position digital distributed beamforming as the standard for mmWave operations in the future. Simply put BeammWave have positioned themselves as thought leaders when it comes to mmWave. The tech they own has sprung out of a decade of research at the University of Lund and what speaks to their clout is they have been able to attract global talent from the likes of Samsung Huawei etc. to work for them instead. The exciting bit is nobody s really caught onto them outside the industry. Yet. The geeky bits underpinning the value Wireless communication is a MASSIVE market. The game has always been the same to get faster speeds more bandwdith and lower latency with less power consumption and at a cheaper price. Data traffic s been increasing at breakneck speed through the adoption of smartphones developments in computing AI etc. to the point where current frequencies in use are simply running out of bandwidth. Moving to higher frequencies what are called mmWave is unavoidable in order to solve the data bandwidth problem. The issue is once you go up in frequency the reach and penetration of radio waves diminish significantly. Huge investments have been made into mmWave only for the tech to disappoint time after time to a point where the whole field has gotten a bit of a bad rep. This is because the industry has been trying to solve it the wrong way. The tech in use today is called analog beamforming the hardware is bulky expensive slow at catching a signal sensitive to spatial change needs an unobstructed line of sight and simply doesn t work well. From the beginning the founders of BeammWave argued that analog beamforming was a stillborn idea it simply would not work in real life. They argued the intelligent way to do beamforming was digital and this is something everyone would agree on but the retort was it wouldn t be cheap enough. It wouldn t be energy efficient enough. It might just be impossible full stop. Well turns out it wasn t. And nobody else was crazy enough to go for it. Where are they at today Since 2023 4 BeammWave has been out of their research and development phase and are now selling their development platform called ADP1 and are working with customers on projects that aim for production. According to the CEO they re on track to have a fully commercial product ready this year with production of scale ramping up in 2026. Currently four major companies are working with them and evaluating their product 1. Molex which is the second largest electronic connector company in the world 2. Alpha Networks with whom they are working on a fixed wireless access solution together 3. SAAB with whom they are working on innovations with military civilian synergies and 4. an as of yet undisclosed customer who has revealed they re an Asian component manufacturer and industry leader in mmWave with over 70 000 employees and 10 billion USD in revenue. All the hints point toward muRata Manufacturing. In the event the rumors are correct I can t stress how huge that would be. It could imply that both Apple and Samsung are nibbling on BeammWave s solution already since muRata supplies them both. Keep in mind BeammWave are the only ones in the world with this kind of tech something everyone in the industry needs to be able to compete in the mmWave frequencies. And they ve protected their solution with over 40 patents so far and more incoming. It will be extremely difficult bordering impossible for anyone to bypass their intellectual property with a distributed digital beamforming solution no matter who you are. So what about the MONEY In interviews the CEO Stefan Svedberg has repeatedly been asked to tease some numbers on how their revenues will scale but understandably he s been quite vague. His exact words from a few months back were that the numbers get pretty ridiculous pretty fast if you start to do math... But since I m not the CEO let me pull some numbers outta my ass anyway. Current stock price is sitting around 0 50USD with a mkt cap of around 13 7 million at a 30 million share float. Say BeammWave chips get into 20 of the smartphones before 2030 around 300 million units per year. The estimate is they ll need 6 10 chips per unit at 1 2USD chip that s 6 20USD per device. Revenue would be totalling 1 8 6 billion USD a year. Let s lowball a P E of 5. That would mean a market cap of 9 30 billion USD in other words 300 1000 USD share at the current float. PWOAH Yeah that went apeshit pretty fast.. And that s only the mobile market. I won t pull any more numbers outta my ass but to me this is looking like one of the plays of the decade. Why is the current valuation so low Well personally I think they d already be due for a 10x with what they have so far but they are a very tech oriented company and what they do is very very complex. I don t think a lot of people understand the scope of their business case and they haven t been shouting about themselves from the rooftops either. There s no sexy one paragraph way of explaining the proposition. On top of that they re trading on the rather obscure Nasdaq First North growth market and not many eyes have been on them so far. But once their stuff starts going to mass production oh boy.

2025-01-10,Tesla Intraday Trading Double Chances or Double Trouble Dear Trading Community I had an enlightening idea while showering this morning that s either completely idiotic or absolutely brilliant. Let s philosophize about Tesla and the art of leveraged trading. The thesis is actually quite simple Tesla is notoriously more volatile than a teenager s mood swings. So why not capitalize on this volatility The plan Every morning at the same time simultaneously open both a long and short position with moderate leverage . Tesla will inevitably move in some direction . As soon as one position turns green cash out. The other position Well we let it ride because Tesla swings back and forth like a metronome on speed. The price will eventually reverse... or not. But seriously let s talk risks Double position fees Spread costs in both directions If Tesla really crashes or moons one position gets completely wiped The notorious theta decay eats away at both positions Musk might tweet. Need I say more What do you think about this foolproof strategy Is this the path to quick riches or an express ticket to the savings account Has anyone experimented with similar approaches P.S. This is not financial advice. I sometimes eat crayons for breakfast.,reddit,0.5902,0.094,0.064,0.842,0.03805331140756607,0.08584672957658768,0.8760999441146851,positive,neutral

2025-01-10,Capital loss carryover question I had significant capital loss in 2024 due to trying to short tesla. I sold the short position but bought back in when the price went higher. At this point unfortunately it s personal because I would be irritated if the price dropped and I was out of the position. But I m not sure if my short position were to become profitable in 2025 year then the capital gains would cancel out from the 2024 losses Thanks,reddit,-0.6901,0.119,0.185,0.695,0.024795694276690483,0.8950279951095581,0.08017632365226746,negative,negative
2025-01-10,Contrarian alert Uber s missing the AI wave yet it looks promising. So after Travis Kalanick got ousted Dara Khosrowshahi stepped in and turned Uber from a wartime to a peacetime company. He cleaned up the culture mess shoved aside long term moonshots and put the company on a strict path to profitability . Despite getting smacked by COVID and high interest rates Uber tightened its belt doubled down on demand supply matchmaking and came out profitable. Wall Street went nuts. Uber is now FCF positive and aiming for even higher margins. So what is Uber today Dara says they re laser focused on nailing that perfect supply demand match. Sure they re winning in mobility and they might tackle new verticals like Fiverr style marketplaces. Sounds great except they re missing out on the biggest opportunity of our era which is motherfucking AI. Uber collects 11B trips a year from 160M users racking up insane amounts of data . This could ve made them a self driving powerhouse. But they ditched their autonomous unit in 2020 to cut costs just as NVIDIA s Jensen Huang now shows off new automotive processors and partnerships with Toyota Aurora and Volvo. Uber s name is nowhere on that list No matter how you spin it a simple supply demand marketplace could get overshadowed once autonomous vehicles go mainstream. Especially when you already own the infrastructure for ride hailing food delivery scooters and bikes. Investors might be licking their chops at two big plays 1. Pull a Reddit Sell anonymized data for LLM training and get lots of money further increasing margins. Instantly Uber gets an AI play. 2. Sell to Tesla or Google Supercharge someone else s AV ambitions and get a fat premium in the process. Meanwhile the stock still looks undervalued. Uber s LTM P FCF is around 22.6x PEG is under 1.0x and a Reverse DCF suggests they only need 9.2 revenue growth over 10 years to justify the current price. That s totally doable. Here s how I see it playing out 1. Best case Tesla or Google acquires them this year and we get a solid premium payday. Probably a stock deal but it s still peanuts compared to Tesla and Google market caps. 2. Second best Uber pivots to selling AI training data. 3. Not bad either Uber dominates more human driven marketplaces. 4. Base scenario They stick to mobility keep expanding margins and maybe bolt on third party AVs .

2025-01-11,The beginning of a Bear Market Since the beginning of 2025 the market has been crashing and in fact in started in December of 2024 Watching the history of the VIX we are currently at the beginning of a cyclical and with the turn of events lately we are set for a real turn in the market by the beginning to end of next week. Short Term ETF VIXY 50MA is about to test the 200MA. Tesla vehicles being recalled and EV sales down down. BoFA no longer sees rate cuts coming in the upcoming years. Blackrock is almost down 10 so far. Yields are up. California is on fire and in big trouble with the 2nd biggest city economy in the world threatened to be burned down. The busiest freeway in the world is shutting down due to these fires happening and on the lowend earlier today the costs were estimated to be 20 billion USD. If the fire does not stop by the end of this weekend the costs could effectively cost California over $1.5 Trillion. Power will be shutoff temporarily for the surrounding areas around LA causing for concerns for public safety. Bankruptcies are definitely expected to increase and while the politics and worldwide conflicts take over the media this upcoming week LA is at risk of going up in smoke. All this being said it is already the most devastating fire in US history and people will lose their home over a force of nature. As of the time of this post only 8 has been contained so far. Be prepared and be ready as the market has already shown signs of cracks and will create issues in the upcoming months.

2025-01-11,Are any of the Mag 7 Stocks a Buy right now I wanna invest for the long term. I have found many people arguing you should just DCA into the Mag 7 but Lump Sum seems better. At the moment I was looking into buying some Google Amazon and Microsoft. They seem decently priced I know I missed the Google jump. Amazon is pretty low for their standard and Microsoft shouldn t see much decline making it seem a decent buy right now. Would you guys buy these 3 right now I will buy Meta when the price goes down Also how come nobody is talking about buying NVIDIA do people not believe in it long term I know Apple and Tesla are not buys and are never talked about understandably so due to high pricing. This makes me feel like only MSFT GOOG AMZN META are long term buys What are your thoughts and thank you,reddit,0.9062,0.108,0.043,0.85,0.05475988984107971,0.05928877741098404,0.8859513401985168,positive,neutral

2025-01-12,S P s $18 Trillion Rally Threatened by Psychology of 5 Yields For years it s seemed like nothing could stop the stock market s inexorable march higher as the S P 500 Index soared more than 50 from the start of 2023 to the end of 2024 adding $18 trillion in value in the process. Now however Wall Street is seeing what can ultimately derail this rally Treasury yields above 5 . Equities traders have shrugged off the bond market s warnings for months focusing instead on the windfall from President elect Donald Trump s promised tax cuts and the seemingly limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence. But the risk came into focus last week as Treasury yields climbed toward their ominous milestones and share prices sank in response. The yield on 20 year US Treasuries breached 5 on Wednesday and jumped back above on Friday reaching the highest since Nov. 2 2023. Meanwhile 30 year US Treasuries briefly crossed 5 on Friday to the highest since Oct. 31 2023. Those yields have risen roughly 100 basis points since mid September when the Federal Reserve started reducing the fed funds rate which has come down 100 basis points over the same time. It is unusual Jeff Blazek co CIO of multi asset strategies at Neuberger Berman said of the dramatic and rapid jump in bond yields in the early months of an easing cycle. Over the past 30 years intermediate and longer term yields have been relatively flat or modestly higher in the months after the Fed initiated a string of rate cuts he added. Traders are watching the policy sensitive 10 year Treasury yield which is the highest it s been since October 2023 and is rapidly approaching 5 a level they fear could spark a stock market correction. It last passed the threshold briefly in October 2023 and before that you have to go back to July 2007. If the 10 year hits 5 there will be a knee jerk reaction to sell stocks said Matt Peron Janus Henderson s global head of solutions. Episodes like this take weeks or maybe a few months to play out and over the course of that the S P 500 could get to down 10 . The reason is fairly simple. Rising bond yields make returns on Treasuries more attractive while also increasing the cost of raising capital for companies. The spillover into the stock market was apparent on Friday as the S P 500 tumbled 1.5 for its worst day since mid December turned negative for 2025 and came close to wiping out all the gains from the November euphoria sparked by Trump s election. While there s no magic to the fixation on 5 beyond round number psychology perceived barriers can create technical barriers said Kristy Akullian Blackrock s head of iShares investment strategy. Meaning a swift move in yields can make it difficult for stocks to rise. Investors are already seeing how. The earnings yield for the S P 500 is sitting 1 percentage point below what s offered by 10 year Treasuries a development last seen in 2002. In other words the return on owning a significantly less risky asset than the US equities benchmark hasn t been this good in a long time. Once yields get higher it becomes harder and harder to rationalize valuation levels said Mike Reynolds vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede Trust. And if earnings growth starts to falter there can be issues. Not surprisingly strategists and portfolio managers predict a bumpy road ahead for stocks. Morgan Stanley s Mike Wilson anticipates a tough six months for equities while Citigroup s wealth division told clients there s a buying opportunity in bonds. The path to 5 on the 10 year Treasury became more realistic on Friday after strong jobs data caused economists to reduce expectations for rate cuts this year. But this isn t just about the Fed. The selloff in bonds is global and based on sticky inflation hawkish central banks ballooning government debts and extreme uncertainties presented by the incoming Trump administration. When you re in hostile waters yields above 5 is where all bets are off Mark Malek chief investment officer at Siebert said. What equity investors need to know now is if and when serious buyers step in. The real question is where we go from there said Rick de los Reyes a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. If it s 5 on its way to 6 then that s going to get people concerned if it s 5 before stabilizing and ultimately going lower then things will be fine. Red Flags The key isn t so much that yields are rising but why market pros say. A slow increase as the US economy improves can help stocks. But a quick jump due to concerns about inflation the federal deficit and policy uncertainty is a red flag. In recent years whenever yields have risen quickly stocks have sold off. The difference this time appears to be complacent investors as seen in bullish positioning in the face of frothy valuations and uncertainties about Trump s policies. And that s putting equities in a vulnerable position. When you look at rising prices a strong job market and an overall strong economy it all points to a possible uptick in inflation said Eric Diton president of the Wealth Alliance. And that s not even including Trump s policies. One area that may prove to be a haven for equity investors is the group that s been driving most of the gains these past few years Big Tech. The so called Magnificent Seven companies Alphabet Inc. Amazon.com Inc. Apple Inc. Meta Platforms Inc. Microsoft Corp. Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. are still posting rapid earnings growth and massive cash flows. Plus looking to the future they re expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence revolution. Investors typically seek high quality stocks with strong balance sheets and strong cash flows during market turmoil said Eric Sterner chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth. The mega techs have become part of that defensive play recently. That s the hope many equity investors are hanging on that mega cap tech companies sway over the broader market and their relative security will limit any weakness in the stock market. The Magnificent Seven have a more than 30 weighting in the S P 500. At the same time the Fed is in the midst of lowering interest rates although the pace is likely going to be slower than expected. That makes this a very different situation than 2022 when the Fed was hiking rates rapidly and indexes plunged. Still many Wall Street pros are urging investors to proceed cautiously for the time being as rate risk hits in various unexpected ways. The companies in the S P 500 that are up the most will probably be the most vulnerable and that could include the Mag Seven and some frothy areas of mid cap and small cap growth will likely be under pressure said Janus Henderson s Peron. We ve been consistent across our firm on staying focused on quality and being valuation sensitive. That will be very important in the coming months.,reddit,0.9984,0.132,0.064,0.804,0.05526979640126228,0.7379180192947388,0.20681212842464447,positive,negative
2025-01-12,Clients returns and the stock company s profits are at odds with each other I ve worked as an asset manager helping people manage their investments. My main focus is on designing retirement plans especially for young clients. Here s the dilemma I face. I firmly believe in long term investing in S P500 or Nasdaq100 index funds and that s what I advise my clients to do for their retirement planning from their early age. The problem arises with short and medium term investments. The more frequently my clients buy and sell individual stocks the higher the fees I earn which makes me wealthier. Leverage stocks like 3x tesla have much higher fees than index funds as you know. But clients who trade frequently tend to see lower returns over time. On the other hand those who simply buy index funds consistently or hold onto blue chip stocks like google or micorsoft for the long term usually achieve much better returns. Of course these long term investors don t generate as much revenue for me. Yet I often find myself advising clients not to trade too often even though I know this reduces my own income. It feels ironic that the system is designed so that frequent trading benefits the stock companies or asset managers but not the investors themselves.,reddit,0.961,0.112,0.032,0.856,0.09242072701454163,0.21369291841983795,0.6938862800598145,positive,neutral

2025-01-13,What is your allocation of ETFS versus Individual Stocks and why As a newer investor I have started investing into big market cap stocks for the long term . However as I have noticed it has more emotional ups and downs can be way more rewarding but also way more gutting. ETF s seems safer less downside and way less emotion and time. However I understand that many choose stocks because it s more entertaining than an etf. But if my main goal was to have May 7 V MA SPGI Uber Nike ASML AMD CRM Sofi what etf suits this best I know many will say choose MAGS but not many do why is that Aside from some wanting strict allocations in a couple and not all.

2025-01-14,NBIS Picks Shovels but make it AI TL DR Company makes infrastructure for AI workloads at extremely impressive efficiency levels. Proprietary configuration for GPU clusters has efficiency levels and compute performance beyond that of Tesla s latest creation which NVDA Jensen said described as remarkable. Tip of the iceberg $700 mil invested by NVIDIA who is supplying H100 Hopper GPUs for their cluster models with the first being constructed in KC with plans to integrate Blackwell GPU H2 2025. Minimal debt totaling $27mil with a near $2bil in cash $1bil planned infrastructure development in 25 with ARR forecast of $750m 1b Primary focus is not some unremarkable data processing system that every SV chump and his grandma are pushing down throats. Nebius was sitting on some already profitable infrastructure in Finland and decided they could expand replicate and improve across Europe and North America. They were able to secure listing on the NASDAQ and quickly obtained a $700 mil investment from Nvidia. Contrary to the few posts from your normal run of the mill bullshit like Motley fool etc... this part on it s own is actually meaningless. Companies the size on Nvidia throw hail mary s at startups all the time and don t blink when they fail. However in the context of their lofty development goals this was their entry point to securing the hardware they needed to succeed of which there is a finite supply. Nebius plans to house 35 000 GPU s upon completion of the KC facility utilizing the latest and incredibly efficient NVIDIA H200 GPUs Alongside this their facility in Finland is getting an overhaul and expansion and a new facility will be constructed in Paris. This is early days P S incredibly low in the peer group which is insane considering the ridiculous multiples on all of the other shit doing nothing in this space. Industry trends are a massive tail wind. If they stay true to growth projections it s only a matter of time before it balloons and Q1 is an excellent test of their reliance and ability to meet targets. They received their first buy rating today from some garage shop trying to play wallstreet dress up but institutional money is going to be eyeing this closely and they have an added advantage of their global footprint for managers looking to reposition this far into the secular bull. As far as revenue goes they reported $43 million in Q3 2024. They anticipate ARR to surpass $700 mil by year end. If we want to keep valuations reasonable relative to peers this company should be valued well above 15 billion by year end making a $65 share price entirely reasonable as the market plays catch up.

2025-01-14,China Discusses Sale of TikTok US to Musk as One Possible Option Bloomberg Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short video app according to people familiar with the matter. Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent ByteDance Ltd. the people say and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on Jan. 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trump s administration one of which involves Musk said the people asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions. A potential high profile deal with one of Trump s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump s re election and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office. Under one scenario that s been discussed by the Chinese government Musk s X the former Twitter would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US TikTok could bolster X s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company xAI that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok. Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary the people said. It s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It s also unclear whether Musk TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal. Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk posted in April that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. In my opinion TikTok should not be banned in the USA even though such a ban may benefit the X platform he wrote on X. Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for. ByteDance and TikTok representatives didn t respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China s Ministry of Commerce government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok s future also didn t respond to requests for comment. The talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok s fate may no longer be in ByteDance s sole control said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs export controls and other issues and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation they said. The Chinese government holds a so called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co. and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still Beijing s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok s valuable recommendation engine it has a significant voice in any possible deal. TikTok s US operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That s a substantial sum even for the world s richest person. It s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction whether it would require the sale of other holdings or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022 and is still paying off sizable loans. Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his Tesla Inc. business the person added. ByteDance s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution s First Amendment. A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President elect Trump who takes office Jan. 20 has sought to delay the TikTok ban which takes effect Jan. 19 so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to save the app and there s been speculation he could take last minute action to sidestep the ban. On a practical level spinning off TikTok s US business would be highly complex affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be extraordinarily difficult. It s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and Shark Tank investor Kevin O Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok which O Leary has said he discussed with Trump. In the past Microsoft Corp. had sought to acquire the business and Oracle Corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company. One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app with different branding to potentially sidestep the ban one of the people said. It s not clear how effective such a move would be. One person close to the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good. Musk is in a position to influence the China US relationship as the world s richest person with businesses that straddle the world s two largest economies. Tesla where Musk is chief executive officer erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition and build goodwill with government officials. While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies including the Biden administration s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. Thoughts Obviously this type of news has the ability to move TSLA META social networks.

2025-01-14,Using two separate orders instead of OCO I m trying to trade a stock using a margin account . When I enter a position I want to be able to separately set a limit and stop order above and below the position. thinkorswim forces you to do an OCO. They won t let you create two separate orders. Example buy 100 shares of TSLA at $400 put in limit sell order for 405.00 put in stop sell order for 395.00 The reason I don t want to use an OCO is because it is slower than putting in two separate orders. Any advice here Are there any other recommended brokers that would allow you to do this. Any help would be greatly appreciated. thank you,reddit,0.943,0.166,0.031,0.803,0.05620207265019417,0.021465875208377838,0.9223320484161377,positive,neutral

2025-01-14,New research note from Damo Up to 100 bullish on Tesla to $800 Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target on Tesla from $400 to $430 and set a new bullish scenario valuation of $800 . The stock index increase was primarily driven by Tesla s progress in self driving car technology and its integration of embedded AI. The report notes that Tesla s unique combination of expertise in data collection robotics energy storage and AI computing infrastructure puts it at the forefront of the emerging self driving mobility market. The analysts emphasize the role of Tesla s Travel Services division the company s self driving carpooling business which is valued at $90 per share in a revised sum of the parts valuation model. The travel services fleet size is expected to grow to 7.5 million vehicles by 2040 with projected revenue per mile of $1.46 and EBITDA margins of 29 Morgan Stanley also emphasized the growing importance of Tesla s Network Services which covers recurring revenue streams such as Fully Self Driving Supercharging and software upgrades. The network services division is expected to contribute about one third of Tesla s total EBITDA by 2030 with that percentage rising to nearly 60 by 2040. The Network Services division is currently valued at $168 per share reflecting its growing importance in Tesla s business model. We are raising our price target to $430 from the previous $400 an adjustment driven by increased valuation of travel services and network services partially offset by lower valuation of the third party battery business the analysts wrote. They note that Tesla has a lot of potential in embedded AI including opportunities in aerospace marine and other areas though these have not yet been factored into this valuation. Analysts expect Tesla s fleet of unmanned self driving cars to debut in urban environments by 2026. However in their Tesla Travel Services forecast self driving cars are not expected to achieve mass deployment until after 2030. While self driving policy may be reassessed at the national level once a new administration takes office the analysts added that Tesla still faces significant hurdles in overcoming the technical testing and licensing challenges associated with near term commercialization. The updated bullish scenario of $800 per share assumes a fleet size of 12 million vehicles by 2040 revenues of $1.50 per mile and EBITDA margins of 45 . This scenario foresees strong international expansion and greater pricing power. On the other hand Morgan Stanley s bearish scenario is valued at $200 per share reflecting potential headwinds such as stricter regulation and slow market expansion.,reddit,0.9914,0.113,0.005,0.882,0.8813135623931885,0.013846732676029205,0.1048397645354271,positive,positive

2025-01-16,What to do with Uber I am right around break even on UBER. I bought in right before that waymo news hit and then GM dropped cruise which knocked the stock down to 60. There has since been a lot of talk about how Uber is going to get disrupted by robotaxis Tesla and google. Luckily after a streak of bad news uber finally started getting some upgrades and even Announced an accelerated buy back. That said recently there has also been rumors of Lyft getting bought by Amazon. If that were to happen I think it would be be very negative for uber. I am contemplating bailing out here break even as this company seems to be in the crosshairs of potential disruption. As it stands now they are crushing it and in the near term will probably continue to do so. I m just nervous waking up one morning to another robotaxi headline or Lyft getting bought by Tesla or Amazon.

2025-01-16,I Asked AI to Build the Best Trading Strategy So I recently asked Chad Geepeetee to create the ultimate trading strategy. I told it to think really outside of the box and run troubleshooting and refinement iterations about 30 times. Here s the strategy it generated. The Quantum Flux Edge Strategy The idea behind this strategy is that markets are like particles in quantum mechanics constantly fluctuating between states of order and chaos. The strategy works by exploiting flux zones which are areas of transition between calm and volatile price action. The Rules 1. Identify the Flux Zone Use a 3 line EMA cloud to identify the market flux. A flux zone occurs when the EMAs converge within a range of 5 of the asset s average daily range . 2. Quantum State Confirmation Overlay a custom oscillator called the Quantum Flow Index . It s basically RSI Bollinger Bands a noise filter from Heikin Ashi candles. When the QFI crosses above 55 in a flux zone it signals that the market is moving into a state of order. Below 45 indicates chaos. 3. Entry Signals Enter a long trade when The price breaks out of the flux zone upward with at least a 1.5x ATR candle. The QFI is above 55 and rising. The volume on the breakout is 20 above the 10 day moving average. Enter a short trade when The price breaks below the flux zone with the same conditions reversed. 4. Profit Targets and Stops Target Use Fibonacci extensions of 1.618 from the flux zone range for exits. Stop Place stops just outside the flux zone. 5. The Entropy Spike Filter This is the unique part before any trade check for an entropy spike which occurs when the QFI diverges from price direction for more than 3 consecutive bars. If it happens no trade it means the market s quantum state is unpredictable. I backtested it on EUR USD BTC USD and TSLA just for fun. The win rate was 48 but the R R was always 1 3 or better so it was tehcnically profitable. But who knows if this will hold up live. Gonna test it on real price action for a month and let ya know the results.,reddit,0.9081,0.063,0.032,0.905,0.046876128762960434,0.04529665783047676,0.9078272581100464,positive,neutral

The Great Depression passed the... Anyone Anyone The tariff bill The Hawley Smoot Tariff Act Which anyone Raised or lowered ... Raised tariffs in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government. Did it work Anyone Anyone know the effects It did not work and t he United States sank deeper into the Great Depression. Opening Scene of Ferris Bueller s Day Off Inauguration of Trump Monday is priced in and it was priced very high in November . What is not priced in is the exact outcome of the flood of Executive Orders waiting to signed on Monday. We have some hints of what they will be but I don t think anyone knows exactly what they will be and how they will be viewed from the market. I expect a wild ride but I don t think the outcomes will match the predictions. My Speculation 1. National Emergency Who the hell knows what it will be Economic Border crisis Public health Your guess is as good as mine. But there will be one and the markets won t like it. Plus Trump declared seven national emergencies last time and another would give him sweeping powers to make significant executive order changes. Puts on SPX OTM. 2. Tariffs I m taking the man at his word tariffs are coming. The specifics what and how much remain unknown but most economists agree this will be bad news. Tariffs also happen to feature in the intro to my favorite movie so that s good enough DD for me. Long puts on XLY and throwing in a little SOYB puts as well. Thanks 3. Bitcoin I know I know. But hear me out Trump isn t going to do anything to hurt BTC. At least not yet. There will at least be signaling of something positive Either way it seems like Bitcoin has an upward trajectory. Calls on IBIT. 4. Hedge If the markets tank they ll tank hard and my deep OTM puts will pay big. However there s always a chance they ll go up. To cover my bases I m doing a straddle on SPX on a 1DTE. If I m wrong and lose all my puts the calls might help me break even. And if my puts hit I won t care about the call premium. I am sure there is some math that says I am doing it wrong. I will pick up a call on SPX ATM towards the end of the day. Sidenote I m stuck holding puts on DJT until it plummets. My DJT calls already paid off so whatever I get out of those puts is pure profit at this point. As a put on TSLA because screw them. I ve been slowly building these positions over time and it s been a rough week. As a rainbow bear I ve been getting punished while theta eats me alive.

2025-01-18,Tech bubble A lot of people assume stocks will go up forever and their earnings will continue to go up no matter what. you know who also thought a certain market would always go up and were SO beyond confident in it. the banks who caused the housing crisis. The market is inflated. if you don t think so ask yourself why so many people have started investing who don t know what they are doing. how many people who have full faith reoccurring investments in SPY who don t even care to look at macro issues we have. people are blinded by bullish sentiment. Most of the MAG7 stocks which make up a significant amount of SPY basically just run off hype. TESLA is so incredibly overbought yet every day there s people posting TESLA TO 500 Tesla doesn t even have to release any news. elon could say 2 words on twitter and the stock goes up 30 dollars on the day. you don t think we are in a bubble the funny part is the crisis we enter from this hyper inflated market can t be stopped. the government is so deep into debt. the most in US history they can t bail themselves out. the government almost had a shutdown due to budgeting a few months ago and you think they can bail us out in a recession the government barely has enough money to sustain itself. actually no. it doesn t have ANY money to sustain itself. i m not sure when no one does but when this crash happens the government will not be there to stop it. they don t have the money. which means neither do the banks. the current debt we are in has almost caused a shutdown. if we enter a recession the government can t give out money to banks stimulus checks reduce taxes. we are AT the threshold of what the government can sustain. if we enter a recession the government literally cannot afford it. mix that in with the hyper inflated market i don t see how anyone is bullish on the market anymore. something horrible is brewing. dumb investors who believe tech will always go up a government that literally cannot sustain itself financially and tech making up an overwhelming chunk of the market in which a lot of blind bullish investors are heavily invested in.,reddit,-0.9853,0.03,0.1,0.871,0.031303275376558304,0.5080656409263611,0.4606310725212097,negative,negative

2025-01-18,I Paper Handed My Way Out of Scoring Nearly $200k in TSLA Puts Today TL DR I am a paper handed bitch and even though I made $3k I am still an idiot. Introduction I have been very lucky this year playing puts and calls. I am already up over $103k since 1 1 and I have the receipts. So cry me a river indeed. Nearly every single play has been buying puts when things seem irrationally high or buying calls when they ve fallen too far What is too far Good question. But to play this you need volume and volatility. $CEG has been the perfect trade for that this year. Four times on three separate days I ve bought puts on their frothiness. Yesterday I made $20k off $CEG in about an hour. Good work if you can get it. So that brings us to today. It s Friday 0 Day Expiration party time This morning lots of things are green and meme stock Elon plaything Tesla is blowing up like a SpaceX rocket over the Carribean. I am ready to make a killing. It s up 5 from the previous day and if my results this year are right it s going to go down. Everything returns to the mean. Nothing finishes at the high of the day. So I buy 200 Put options for $1.24 at $430. It s a $25k bet and my account is ready. But it doesn t go down right away. This is fine I tell myself as the stock goes up to 436 437... So I decide to double down and buy 150 put options for $1.46 at $435. It s a $22k bet. I ve now got $47k on the line about half my gains on the year. If the stock traces back to $430 it ll be great. $425 would make serious coin. But I forgot Tesla stock is fucking insane and every regard in this sub is jerking it to this chart. At this point I have the live chart on my screen and I know I am going to eat shit and be down more than $40k and wipe out everything I ve scammed for this year. Every time it comes down to 437 it goes back up to 439. 438. 439. 438. Stupid TSLA. But wait With an hour left it starts to fall just like I thought it would. To $434 at least. My second buy is green more than $10k while my first one is pretty much toast. Every tick up or down is the worst. With less than an hour ago the flip flopping continues. $432. Back up to $433. I realize I am up $21k on one put and down $17k on the other put. I panic sell both and leave with $3k gains. Survival I was stunned any dork bought my obviously dead put with minutes left. So what happens $TSLA crashes all the way to $426.50 at end of day. I was right. So let s do the math on those puts $435 $426.5 $8.5 150 100 $127 500 $430 $426.5 $3.5 200 100 $70 000 I would have cleared $197 500 instead of $3 200 because I was a paper handed bitch and didn t want to lose $47k.

2025-01-19,The great scam market I posted a similar Topic in a couple of other subs yesterday but Mods were quickly removing them on the basis that the question was too subjective Anyway I ve been working on a theory for a few years now that the markets have very very little to do with actual company performance or metrics and everything to do about Mass perception and psychology Almost every day now I see a trader trying to analyse a stock based on a Shiller ratio or a Buffet Indicator or pattern whatever ... Are we really going to kid ourselves the markets are trading on these metrics anymore if so how do we explain Big Tech most of the valuations defy every piece of logical or rational explanation A share price can move more on 4 lines of text from an individual on a social media site than on a full quarters earnings report Then allow me to move into day trading which is perhaps the most manipulated aspect of the entire show we ve known since the dawn of time Tutes and Hedges have the upper hand but now I believe with A.I trading algorithms thats been taken to a level whereby there s literal fraud happening on a daily basis If you think this is crazy conspiracy level stuff try researching algorithmic and cryptographic trading signals These theories and technology s speculate that these trading Algos can now actually communicate between each other via a certain price signal and then work together to shift the market higher or lower You can t beat this yea you can get lucky and maybe be on the right side of the coin when it happens but generally over a sustained period these are cleverly programmed to bleed day traders out and to often go against Mass assumption This explains the very odd situation whereby sometimes a company gets bad news the stock actually ends up trading higher and vice versa. This is a strange Phenomenon most traders can never explain or comprehend so its often passed of as oh markets just being irrational No that s a lie its being done intentionally to Fvck the opposite positions Tesla is a fantastic example of everything I ve talked about above really the daily and weekly price movement needs to investigated by the SEC for securities fraud but I believe a deep forensic analysis would uncover a body of manipulation and fraud Long term we all know the overall stock market will keep going higher and higher forever which I guess means locking capital in for 40 years into ETF s makes the most sense but again the big boys know dam well Retail gets impatient and wants faster gain and will try to make daily weekly or monthly trades Theres a lot of FOMO out there now too which further exacerbates many traders need to get in on the action This is exactly what Tutes Hedges and Banks want ......it s their bread and butter Anyway looking forward to hearing others opinions I m not particularly interested in discussing if this is a conspiracy or not because frankly its brutally obvious a lot of this is happening in some context and you would be very very Naive to think otherwise But maybe I have some angles or aspects wrong or maybe I ve missed something somebody else wants to add,reddit,-0.9916,0.06,0.119,0.821,0.03429798781871796,0.10967914760112762,0.856022834777832,negative,neutral

2025-01-20,Tired of losing Money on pumps n dumps Dig deeper With TMC The easiest multibagger of Your life EDIT TRUMP CONFIRMED TO EXPAND ON DRILLING What is TMC THE Mineral Company Its a deep ocean mining company Trump loves that stuff Trumps indicated tariffs on China they for sure want to mine their own metals even if it is underwater and the current administration is positive to deep sea mining if there is money to be made they are gonna legalize it. The mineral deposits they are working on are worth almost 60x of its current mcap alone with todays prices. Trade war and tariffs vs China Russia etc might make this even higher The boring stuff TMC the metals company Inc. is a deep sea minerals exploration firm focused on collecting processing and refining polymetallic nodules from the seafloor primarily in the Clarion Clipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean. These nodules contain metals such as nickel cobalt copper and manganese which are essential for electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy storage solutions. Ring a bell Over the past 52 weeks the stock has fluctuated between $0.721 and $2.070. The company has a market capitalization of approximately $372.52 million with 341.76 million shares outstanding. TMC reported a net loss of $99.34 million over the trailing twelve months resulting in an earnings per share of $0.32. Currently the company does not generate revenue. Sadly i bought in after the recent 30 spike but this thing is going even higher. Price targets from professionals Analyst coverage for TMC is limited. One analyst has issued a Hold rating with a 12 month price target of $4.00 this is over a 2x from the current price Stock Analysis Another source indicates a mean price target of $4.18. Be aware that TMC operates in a nascent industry with inherent risks including regulatory challenges environmental Centerns and the technical complexities of deep sea mining. The company s financial performance has been characterized by net losses and it currently lacks revenue generation. Potential investors should conduct thorough due diligence and consider these factors when evaluating the investment potential of TMC. Insiders own 58.79 of the Stock and the latest price target came from Alliance global partners With a PT of 3.75 Steve Jurvetson renowned for his roles at SpaceX and Tesla was just added to their board. This is one of the big ones. In late May 2024 The Metals Company announced a significant breakthrough the first successful extraction of battery grade nickel from deep sea sources. Independent third party evaluations confirmed that the nickel extracted from the Pacific Ocean could be processed into nickel sulfate a crucial component in battery manufacturing. Company forecasts indicate that their undersea resources could potentially supply the material needs of up to 280 million electric vehicles which is equivalent to the current number of vehicles on U.S. roads. Analysts predict a break even point by next year or 2026 positioning The Metals Company as a compelling near term investment among penny stocks. Which is Incredible for a deep sea mining Stock. I currently have 6k invested in tmc and putting in 4 more at market open tomorrow. I dont think this stock is gonna move at lightspeed until something happens on the legalization front but you never know.,reddit,0.9087,0.071,0.037,0.892,0.07081863284111023,0.0520474836230278,0.877133846282959,positive,neutral

2025-01-21,Does a fairly large earnings miss stop a stock s incredible momentum for the intermediate future I understand that a big earnings miss will weaken a stock s momentum.. Mathematically that is obvious BUT what i am asking is if NVDA TSLA LLY Planatir etc. have big earnings miss can the stock price shake it off and continue an incredible bullish run.. Or is that generally the end of the extraordinary stock run In recnt times it seems like the 4 stocks i mentioned had really amazing runs .. w as there very little bad news associated with them Or did investors create their bubble like returns to some degree absent specific good news much of the time Something I ve wondered for awhile.. Surprisingly i have not seen a research paper on this subject Right i am wondering this about Tesla in particular.. NVDA and LLY have slowed alot.. And Planitir not a key stock I do know AAPL didn t have a meaningful earnings miss for a long time.. 10 years or so Thanks in adance..

2025-01-21,XPEL Analyzing Growth Potential in the Automotive Market Here s my condensed analysis of XPEL FYI I focus on uncovering companies with strong growth potential and sharing my insights. Note All hyperlinks will lead you to direct source material Disclaimer I DO NOT own shares of XPEL at the time of writing I would love to hear from the community and have a in depth conversation from ya ll. Thank you enjoy Macro Overview Electric Vehicle Growth The U.S. EV market is projected to show annual growth of 10.54 from 2025 2029 resulting in a market value of $156.3 billion by 2029 Unit sales alone are projected to reach 2.32 million units by 2029 as well. Consumers now have significantly more choices when shopping for an electric vehicle. They can choose from offerings by Hyundai and many others. EV s often have unique aesthetic and maintenance needs that typically have high quality protective films and coatings. The growth in consumer adoption of EV s coincides with Xpel products particularly on the impact in the aftermarket. EV owners value vehicle preservation. This creates a growing market share for XPEL S products. These products also include heat reducing window films that indirectly enhance battery performance. Aging Vehicles The average car or truck on the road in the U.S in 2024 was more than 12.6 years old a new record according to Consumers now choose to keep cars longer than they used to. This is largely because of the increases in new vehicle prices. As these older vehicles age the demand for general maintenance and preservation are more likely to rise. Car price increases have climbed for four consecutive months according to As of December 2024 the average price of a new vehicle was $49 740 the second highest level ever recorded. Economic uncertainty and higher costs can discourage new purchases. This situation favors repairs and maintenance of existing vehicles as the fleet continues to get older before replacement. Technological advancements from XPEL and competitors and were released much earlier. They have recently gained traction as consumers want paint protection film to protect their vehicles. Self healing films use polymer capable of automatically repairing minor scratches and abrasions when exposed to heat. As vehicles on the road become increasingly older the demand for reduced effort in maintaining a vehicle s exterior will increase. Vehicle owners will likely seek easier maintenance solutions with minimal effort that repel against water dirt and scratches more easily. Consumers and manufacturers are increasingly adopting self healing films. People who want to protect their older vehicles find XPEL appealing. It is also chosen to keep luxury cars in pristine condition. Investment Thesis XPEL is a compelling investment with an attractive growth story in the automotive sector. It is supported by a strong brand presence international expansion growth and financial strength. With high expectations investors should take notice in the premium valuation risks apparent. Long term growth is certainly compelling but there are clear short term headwinds including macroeconomic uncertainties that require careful monitoring. Product Diversification XPEL is widely known for their paint protection films. These films contribute to 70 of total Q3 sales and grew by 2.7 . Still products like their window film and ceramic coatings have outperformed with growth of 20.6 . like home office window films antimicrobial film and niche surface protection film also out performed by 11.6 . Together both segments contributed 30 to total sales. Impressive growth outperformance though has largely been a significant reason for overall revenue growth in recent quarters. International Expansion U.S. sales are the largest contributor to total revenue accounting for 57.2 of the total and reaching $64.6 million in Q3 reflecting year over year growth of 9.4 . Despite the reliance on U.S. sales International sales continue to outperform. Canada is the second largest contributor at 12.8 of revenue with growth of 25.7 to $14.4 million. All international markets saw growth except for the third largest market which is China. China saw a significant decline of 11.6 to just $9.06 million. The decrease was primarily attributed to XPEL s distributor working through excess inventory levels. With only a weighting of 8 of total sales the negative growth did not hurt overall sales significantly. While XPEL faced challenges in China as well as minor growth of 4.1 and 1.4 in Europe and the U.K strong international performance lead to record revenue. Strategic Partnerships XPEL has established multiple strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. Recent collaborations with brands like exclusive supplier partnership and have been formed. These collaborations including with service providers like have strengthened market presence. Brand visibility and revenue growth have also increased as a result. The Tesla partnership in particular is of major importance due to their dominance in the EV market. These recent collaborations integrate XPEL s wide array of products into solutions for high profile vehicles and events. The partnerships with Tesla and Rivian are particularly significant. They expand their reach into the electric vehicle market that continues to rapidly grow in the U.S. and internationally. Risk Factors Reliance On Chinese Distribution from a new administration will significantly impact XPEL if enacted. If new tariffs are applied XPEL will be faced with increases in far materials leading to higher production costs. With the U.S market as the largest source of revenue at 57.2 passing on further costs to consumers would likely reduce demand. Most importantly reliance on one distributor could lead to supply chain constraints due to an over reliance on one company. Price increases or delayed deliveries would harm relationships and hurt XPEL s brand. The Culper Research Short Report On October 19 2023 sending XPEL s stock retreating 17.3 from $51.51 per share to $42.61. A notable accusation was XPEL s understated reliance on Tesla. by stating Tesla represented just 5 of 2023 revenue. Secondly Culper believes XPEL is concealing a massive risk. Their primary supplier Entrotech Inc has formed a on May 23 2023. Lastly Culper s claim as seen below would have massive repercussions for XPEL if they are correct. Additional Culper Info The validity of Culper s claims on XPEL and others have been for self benefiting public statements. What we do know for sure is the joint venture with PPG Industries is in fact truthful. The extent of which XPEL will become obsolete on the other is a highly questionable take. For some reason Culper did not mention that XPEL stands out due to their DAP software. It is not because of the PPF raw material. Hence XPEL would know exactly how much material and company their products were installed on. These allegations were made in 2023. XPEL has continued to show strong growth. The company has not skipped a beat. Conclusion XPEL offers an attractive growth story in the automotive industry. This growth is supported by their strong market position and international expansion. The company also has a diverse product portfolio and strategic partnerships. A P E ratio of 23.98 certainly wouldn t be viewed as cheap by any measures. Still their P E is significantly below their five year average P E of 41.6. Long term growth remains compelling with the expectation of double digit growth in the next two years. Nonetheless there are near term headwinds. Sure XPEL has displayed a history of growth but near term macroeconomic uncertainties regarding tariff concerns are worth monitoring. XPEL must consider how to react to such challenges since their distributor is based in China. For the reasons noted above we still believe XPEL is a compelling BUY. It offers long term sustainable growth strategic partnerships international expansion and a strong balance sheet.,reddit,0.9993,0.159,0.035,0.805,0.3709545433521271,0.01869290880858898,0.6103525757789612,positive,neutral

Matt Tuttle who struck gold with leveraged meme stock funds but fell flat with his Jim Cramer ETFs has filed to create a line of new offerings that will trade fast twitch derivatives on popular companies beloved by the retail investing masses. Think Nvidia Corp. Tesla Inc. MicroStrategy Inc. and more. The gamble Publicly traded single stock options aren t available on a daily basis meaning 0DTE bets can currently only occur on a Friday when weekly monthly and quarterly contracts expire. Yet Tuttle says he is convinced it s a matter of time before derivatives tied to individual companies shift to daily expiry. Whether that s three months from now six months from now two years from now I have no idea the Tuttle Capital Management CEO said. My thinking is if I do believe that s going to happen I want to be first in line for it. In the meantime Tuttle has come up with a workaround for his new ETFs which could launch in the first half of the year provided the Securities and Exchange Commission doesn t object. They ll trade so called Flex options customized contracts that allow users to set terms such as strike prices and expiration dates and roll them on a daily basis. Such contracts can be listed on exchanges without approvals in advance Tuttle said. America s dynamic $11 trillion ETF industry is no stranger to investment strategies being prepared before demand feasibility or even regulatory approval is assured. Increasingly complicated strategies featuring diverse leverage and return targets are being packaged into the easily traded wrapper and sold to the masses. Tuttle is seeking to capitalize on two hot but controversial trends on Wall Street Selling options to generate income and trading those with zero days to expiration or 0DTE. His firm plans a series of so called 0DTE covered call ETFs targeting mostly technology megacaps including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. To Ben Johnson head of client solutions at Morningstar the industry s emphasis on first mover advantage and apparent indifference to the risks of many strategies highlight the growing competition between firms for new business. Another blast from the ETF industry s spaghetti cannon a shot fired in hopes that a few of these products might stick to the wall Johnson said. Sponsors are clearly not all that interested in whether these products actually have any long term investment merit he said. The concept of an ETF using 0DTE options is not new. The likes of Defiance ETFs and Roundhill Investments have launched ETFs focused on indexes such as the S P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 that aim to harvest income from zero day contracts. But almost three years after derivatives on indexes and ETFs began expiring daily the same change has yet to be made for single stock options. Unlike S P 500 index options that are proprietary to Cboe Global Markets the trading venue at the center of the 0DTE craze listing single stock zero day contracts would be an industry wide effort said a spokesperson at the exchange. Tuttle attracted widespread attention in 2021 when he launched a fund betting against Cathie Wood s Ark Innovation ETF. While his attempt to ride the fame of Cramer the host of CNBC s Mad Money show sputtered in short order his foray into super leveraged single stock ETFs produced some of 2024 s biggest hits. The ETF industry is very clever about finding workarounds to buy time until the real thing is ready Eric Balchunas senior ETF analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence said of the proposed funds. In the end how the sausage is made isn t that important to investors. They just care that they re getting this sort of cool hot sauce and end product. Thoughts on this ETFs that become massive from investors not understanding the risks are nothing new but this will lead to interesting trading situations when there s dislocation between these theorized 0 DTE underlying ETFs and security itself. I can foresee a situation where 0 DTEs are massively overvalued undervalued compared to what the underlying should theoretically be and then take a arbitrage position on these . Guess they really want that options gambling money from the people who can t get approved to trade options.

2025-01-22,Tesla CEO Elon Musk bashes the $500 billion AI project Trump announced claiming its backers don t have the money Shortly after President Donald Trump announced a new massive AI infrastructure investment from the White House First Buddy Elon Musk tried to tear it down. They don t actually have the money Musk wrote on his social media platform X. SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority. Trump said the investment will create a new company called Stargate to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States. The leaders of SoftBank OpenAI and Oracle stood alongside Trump during the announcement. Their respective companies will invest $100 billion in total for the project to start with plans to pour up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years. Perhaps it should not be a surprise that Musk is going after an OpenAI initiative. Musk is in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman who was at the White House for the announcement. Musk who has said he doesn t trust Altman claims in the lawsuit the ChatGPT has abandoned its original nonprofit mission by reserving some of its most advanced AI technology for private customers. The companies involved in Stargate have not publicly disclosed how they will contribute the funds but they don t necessarily need the money in the bank to support it they could raise debt or sign on other equity investors.,reddit,0.8534,0.089,0.037,0.874,0.04409913718700409,0.0700417160987854,0.8858591914176941,positive,neutral

2025-01-23,Reddit ETF progress from Jan 2021 to Jan 2025 This was made at the beginning of 2021 near the period of peak euphoria. Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time which you can see in the comments of that post. Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later which is why it did not appear there. I felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it and now have been doing yearly updates. After all for something like this you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least. We are now on year 4 and to date I have sarcastically remarked about how the sharp financial geniuses of the time performed against SPY and VTI. This year I was rather surprised at the results. All 2025 numbers use the prices right now. I used a $100 000 initial investment and just rounded all the prices to the dollar for visual simplicity . This also backtracks prices from stock splits.

2025-01-24,DD UiPath Mispriced and Misunderstood I m looking for the regardedest lowest humblest of you to confirm the way. Big brains didn t agree when I said PLTR bumpy revenues weren t a concern . Big brains didn t agree when I said get into Bitcoin before the wall street wave . Big brains didn t agree when I said Tesla revenues were about to go parabolic . It s true when they say Bears sound smart at parties but the bulls make money. Big brains are too smart for their own good blowing up fears in their minds. Why do I even posts Selfishly to have a record of being right. I love looking back and saying yep yep yep and laughing at big brains while wiping my ass with cash. I didn t go to Harvard or work for a big firm. I have a chip on my shoulder and I m here to outclass them all. So fellow idiots I think we have another winner. Time to get hyped. UiPath $13.86 . Big brains claim RPA is dead Those pushing AI Agents and claiming RPA is dead are wrong. They assume AI Agents can be developed by skipping straight to step Z when in reality they will need to build steps A Y. AI currently only has a brain. It needs hands and tools connected it to perform real work. UiPath has built out steps A Y and is ready to take step Z. UiPath is in a position to capitalize on the power of Gen AI. There s a spectrum of automation applications and RPA will still make the most sense in many use cases as the most efficient tool for the job . AI Agents will have their place but UiPath will have a system to orchestrate the spectrum of tools spanning from RPA hybrid to advanced AI agents. Big brains claim UiPath has no moat. UiPath s product is more differentiated than the market gives them credit for. The market seems to conflate all RPA vendors as interchangeable but I believe there are nuanced and important differences between the offerings. UiPath appears to be the most robust user friendly and an innovation leader. Where s their moat 1. Network effects. They have a large install base with 10 000 customers 2. UiPath is immune to vendor locking . 3. Preferred vendor partner to major consulting companies . 4. Existing partnerships with major software companies gives UiPath exposure to potential new customers. 5. UiPath has a large base of experienced RPA developers that prefer to use UiPath and who are likely to recommend it where they go. 6. Founder led. Founder is a product focused engineer not a career executive playing politics in a bureaucracy. This allows UiPath to be nimbler and seize market opportunities as they arise. Big brains claim UiPath s growth story is over. Gen AI can have a similar effect on UiPath as it did on Palantir and their AIP product. Gen AI will make the existing UiPath platform exponentially more powerful meaning more and higher value use cases. As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world their sales will accelerate. Big brains have beaten this stock to death. This stock is down from all time highs at $85.12 share in 2021 to less than $14 share today. Big brains seem to be discounting UiPath s potential at a current price to sales multiple of 5.275x. SAAS companies can easily trade between 10 20x. UiPath has $1.6B in cash and $0 debt. 82 gross margins. 113 net dollar retention On the verge of flipping profitable. Guidance from last earnings call they said ARR is expected to stabilize and free cash flow to accelerate. TLDR My bet is UiPath has a greater than 50 chance for growth reacceleration. UiPath product differentiation will become more apparent in the future. As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world their sales will accelerate. . None of this is financial advice. I may or may not know what I m doing. Reposted with position. $PATH $PATH,reddit,0.9971,0.159,0.062,0.779,0.07221748679876328,0.026222381740808487,0.9015601873397827,positive,neutral

2025-01-24,$500B Stargate AI Project What Sectors and Stocks Could Win Big So the $500 billion Stargate AI Project was just announced and honestly that s a huge amount of money being thrown into AI and related tech. It s got me thinking what sectors and companies could ride this wave in the near future If history tells us anything investments of this scale tend to shake up entire industries with both big names and under the radar players benefiting. Let s break it down by sector because there s a lot to unpack here 1. Semiconductors The Brains Behind AI AI doesn t run without hardware and semiconductors are at the heart of it all. GPUs CPUs and those fancy AI specialized chips are the foundation of machine learning. Companies like Nvidia AMD and Intel are already dominating this space and I wouldn t be surprised if they see even more demand. Nvidia especially is practically the poster child for AI hardware. Their growth has been insane and a project of this magnitude could push it even further. Expect AI chips to continue driving their revenue in the coming years. 2. Cloud Computing Data Centers AI projects need a ton of computing power and storage. That s where the big cloud providers AWS Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud come in. These companies are likely already gearing up to grab their slice of the Stargate pie. Then you ve got data center companies like Equinix and Digital Realty Trust which could also benefit. All this AI data has to live somewhere and these companies provide the backbone for hosting it. 3. AI Software Players It s not just about the hardware companies building the actual AI tools and software are in a great spot too. Think Palantir C3.ai and Snowflake. These players already help businesses make sense of their data and implement AI driven solutions so they could see a major surge in demand. The rise of AI as a service could also give these companies a big boost as the Stargate Project moves forward. 4. Startups The Dark Horses This is where things get really interesting. While the big names are obvious winners startups working on niche AI applications could also see some major growth. Some of these smaller companies aren t on anyone s radar right now but they could pop up as key players or even get acquired by the bigger guys. If you re into high risk high reward opportunities this might be where you want to look. 5. Telecom Networking Supporting the AI Boom AI depends on fast low latency networks to transfer data efficiently. That s why telecom and networking companies are probably smiling right now. Companies like Cisco Juniper Networks and even those working on 5G infrastructure could benefit. After all all that AI data has to move through fast reliable connections and these are the folks making that possible. 6. Autonomous Tech EVs This one s a bit of a wildcard but it makes sense. Companies like Tesla Waymo and Mobileye that are working on self driving cars and autonomous tech could see a boost. AI is critical for advancing self driving capabilities and a major investment like this might accelerate developments in the space. 7. Cybersecurity As AI adoption grows so do concerns around data privacy and security. Cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike Palo Alto Networks and Zscaler could also be beneficiaries. Protecting sensitive AI systems and the data they process is going to be a top priority. So what do you all think Are there other sectors or companies that might benefit Any smaller names worth keeping an eye on Let s discuss,reddit,0.9963,0.129,0.024,0.847,0.11498617380857468,0.016804665327072144,0.8682091236114502,positive,neutral

2025-01-24,Amprius Technologies my DD and conclusions. TL DR Why Amprius Is a Hidden Gem Amprius Technologies makes next level batteries with crazy high energy density way better than standard lithium ion batteries. These batteries are lighter charge faster and last longer. Their tech is already in demand for electric vehicles drones and aerospace. With a new factory coming online and revenue expected to skyrocket AMPX looks like a solid bet in the booming clean energy market. 1. What They Do Amprius specializes in silicon nanowire anode batteries. Translation Their batteries pack more power into a smaller lighter package compared to regular lithium ion batteries. Imagine an EV that can go farther on a single charge or a drone that can fly longer this is why companies like Airbus and DARPA are already working with them. 2. Why Now Massive Market Growth EVs drones and clean energy tech are exploding. The EV market alone is expected to grow by 23 annually through 2030. New Factory Coming Online Amprius Colorado factory will start producing batteries at scale in 2024. This will double their production capacity in 2025 and pave the way for even bigger growth in the years ahead. Real Revenue They made $85M in 2024 and are projecting $130M for 2025 with improving profit margins. 3. Why Their Batteries Are Game Changing Lighter and More Powerful Energy density of up to 500 Wh kg compared to 250 300 Wh kg in regular batteries. Super Fast Charging Cuts charging times by up to 70 . Long Lasting Built to handle tough conditions perfect for defense drones and EVs. 4. Who s Buying Amprius isn t just some future promise company big players are already working with them. Aerospace Defense Airbus and DARPA use their batteries for lightweight long endurance applications like drones and satellites. EV Potential As EV makers look for lighter longer lasting batteries Amprius could land deals with major automakers . Consumer Electronics Imagine longer battery life for smartphones wearables and laptops. 5. The Numbers Look Good Revenue Growth 55 in 2024 expected to jump another 53 in 2025. Big Manufacturing Boost New factory will help them scale production from 2 GWh in 2025 to 10 GWh by 2028. Patents Tech Over 80 patents protect their breakthrough tech keeping competitors like QuantumScape and Solid Power in the rearview. 6. Why It s Undervalued Compared to other battery companies Amprius is flying under the radar. Their price to sales ratio is around 12 while competitors like QuantumScape are at 16 18. This leaves room for big upside as more investors catch on to their growth story. 7. Risks Supply Chain Issues They re locking in long term deals for key materials like silicon. Competition Solid state batteries are a threat but Amprius is years ahead in real working tech. Scaling Challenges New factories are expensive but their track record shows they know how to deliver. The Bottom Line Amprius Technologies is the kind of small cap stock with huge upside potential. They re riding the electrification wave with proven tech growing revenue and major demand from industries like EVs and aerospace. With a new factory set to scale production in 2025 AMPX could be a major winner in the battery space. Verdict Hodl through 2025 if you believe in clean energy and tech stocks with real growth potential.,reddit,0.9943,0.137,0.022,0.842,0.41056764125823975,0.014200214296579361,0.5752321481704712,positive,neutral

2025-01-25,Deere has run out of room to run. The great American company is trading at a all time high but is facing a lot of headwinds in 2025. 1 Tarriffs Deere made the mistake of outsourcing their production outside the US and will pay the price with the new administration. They recently announced they were moving production to Mexico for some of the equipment manufacturing which lead to a boycott by farmers and a threat of 200 tariff if they do which wont happen because you cant really impose this tax on a specific company. But this was a mistake by the company because now they spent all this money to setup the factories and production in Mexico but cant really use it as intended. They also made the mistake of outsourcing tractor production to India. A good amount of production is outside the US meaning tractors are assembled in India Europe and elsewhere and sent to the US for sale. Which is a problem because these are not cheap tractors equipment and someone is going to pay the tariff on foreign goods entering the United States. Not that easy to readjust the whole supply chain back to the US and having to pay people alot more money. Average worker in India makes $5k per year in the US these manufacturing jobs will cost maybe $50k $80k per year. Profit margins just got smaller. Then there is the US manufacturing exports. Deere Exports alot of their products to other countries not all customers are in the US. If we impose tariffs on lets say German cars coming into the US they will 100 in retaliation impose tariffs on US cars heavy equipment and farm equipment being sent into Europe South America China Etc. Deere isnt the only manufacturer of tractors and farm equipment you have a lot of manufacturers around the world. People are just going to buy cheaper domestic products. 2 Rumored Pick up truck There s been a rumor going around they are planning to launch a pick up truck. I think this would be a costly mistake and they just wouldn t be able to compete with the best selling pickup in the world the F 150. Car manufacturing is very expensive as Elon has stressed multiple times ramping up production costs ALOT of money and might not be worth the effort especially if it flops. There is just too much competition is the space between Toyota Ford General Motors Tesla Rivian Nissan Dodge. 3 FTC sues Deere for Farmers right to repair The complaint This unfair steering practice has boosted Deere s multi billion dollar profits on agricultural equipment and parts growing its repair parts business while burdening farmers with higher repair costs the FTC s complaint alleges. i dont think this FTC suit is going away the current administration will 100 stand behind the hard working farmers that feed America. 62 of revenue comes from Agriculture Equipment and 13 comes from financial services. Farmers are using Deere Financing to repair Deere equipment Its 100 a monopoly. Between decreasing revenue sales higher labor cost higher production costs and increased competition this company has quite a few challenges to work through this year.,reddit,-0.9698,0.06,0.104,0.836,0.037750668823719025,0.7486809492111206,0.213568314909935,negative,negative

2025-01-27,Trying to understand hedging I see youtubers recommending hedging of stock positions by selling calls or buying puts but i feel like it doesnt make a lot of sense to me as a small trader as i can enter and exit positions without much fuss. E.g. this youtuber owns a few hundred tsla shares that he is holding for the long term and sells calls on a weekly basis. I have a few problems with this approach. 1 if he is holding for the long term why would he risk his shares getting called away 2 if he is selling calls at resistance why would he not just take some profits Again it seems like using options as hedges only seems sensible if i am holding like thousands of shares with low float. Am i missing something here Edit no capital gains tax. I am not American nor is this youtuber. It might make sense to hedge using options if i have to pay taxes on my realised profits.,reddit,0.8499,0.13,0.094,0.776,0.038328852504491806,0.16455219686031342,0.7971189618110657,positive,neutral

2025-01-27,My loss of 2024 The word of the day is greed. I started trading options this year and this is how it went. Messed around with some small cap calls lost 100 on some and made 300 on others. my eyes grew big I had no idea you could make 300 off a stock moving 5 or 10 . I went HEAVEY into Dd around June and would stay up all night sometimes just to loose the next day but I never gave up. One day around September when they did the rate cuts I heard the news bought in Nvidia and QQQ calls right before close. They both gapped up the next day. I traded on that market open ended up making quite a few trades turned $200 into 5000 in 24 hours. I go back to focusing on DD and find my next opportunity. I remember trading other things making too many trades. Started drinking a lot wishing everyday could be like that day. My account goes down to 2 000. I put everything into Tesla calls right before earnings and my sober mind set up the play where I could buy 100 shares of Tesla at 230 for just 1800 dollars. How Well Tesla was at 216 and had record sells so I bought a weekly 230 and 13 weekly 240s. I ll be damned if that plan didn t work out. But my paper handing ass sold at market open and fucked it all up. That s where the downward spiral started. In the next trading week I went all in on qqq calls 1 dte and it tanked the next day. Anyways after that trade I went on a downward spiral and a pretty bad one. Almost lost everything. . I was drinking way to much to cope with the pain was my excuse. but on Christmas I put it down haven t drank since. Everyday I do dd on company s and watch the charts. plan my next move also started reading the intelligent investor that Warren buffet recommends. This year will be different I can feel it. Side note I have traded the market since 2020. But only started trading options or 1 year.,reddit,-0.8364,0.072,0.093,0.835,0.045330412685871124,0.3324225842952728,0.622247040271759,negative,neutral
2025-01-27,The Case for TSLA the Business Value Many people consider TSLA to be overvalued based on fundamentals. Make no mistake it absolutely is... based on fundamentals. The value of TSLA beyond the Twitter political volatility comes from its proven track record in achieving the impossible. Breaking Into an Otherwise Unbreakable Car Market How many new Western car companies can you recall successfully breaking into the market in the last few decades The only real answer is TSLA. Everything else is bleeding money a penny stock or a YouTube car review channel side quest. Popularizing an Otherwise Undesirable and Impossible Product Before the EV boom any consideration of a successful EV business would be immediately countered with legitimate concerns. The car community wouldn t be very excited without their loud 4L V8 engines. The product would be impossible to make as the batteries would be expensive heavy unreliable and yield a low driving range. If you did get an EV you wouldn t be able to charge it since there were no charger networks. Not to mention the expected environmental returns from selling EVs but generally disrupting the market and directing it towards sustainable energy cars. I love my fuel hungry loud 6 cylinder German beast but ICE engines in the mainstream have an expiration date and will eventually become a niche when the larger market transitions to EVs. TSLA takes the credit for this singlehandedly. Everybody else follows. Scaling Up Actually Selling Cars Tesla is EV sales and is in the of all car sales. Meanwhile VW is closing down their factories in Germany. Advertisement by Word of Mouth You see Ford Focus 1.0 EcoBoost billboard ads everywhere in Europe and RAM JEEP Chevy Silverado F 150 Hyundai Kia ads everywhere in the US. TSLA built itself on word of mouth and a vision for the future which is a testament to its value for customers. Elon s Proven Track Record in Business . With someone so unreasonably effective at building things that work investors project that TSLA is a safe and promising bet. How many reusable rockets has anybody else caught landing recently Criticisms No product or company is without criticisms. From the bad build quality to the still unfulfilled FSD promises to the lack of Cybertrucks in Europe to the removal of the turn signal stalks and most recently the political criticisms. Consequential Actions Not Ideologies Drive the World The bottom line for a business is creating products and services that people love and there are zero indicators that TSLA as a business is going anywhere. It thrives despite all criticism and lack of marketing which is a testament to the value they provide. Market Temper Tantrums Are a Feature Not a Bug Look beyond the ephemeral temper tantrum driven volatility of the market. Last year in March GOOG dipped from 160 to 135 when Gemini generated some questionable images today it s close to ATH at 200. Last year in August CRWD dipped from 380 to 220 when they pushed out a buggy update. Today it s trading close to ATH again. Today the market finally noticed DeepSeek and is going through yet another mental breakdown. It is like a palm tree it will bend but it won t break. Learn to put your prejudices aside and buy companies that execute well not companies with a nice little PR team that will sweet talk you. But Is It Overpriced By traditional fundamentals analysis of course it is. But we ve already established there s nothing traditional about TSLA as a company so your little P E ratio calculations won t work. They have failed consistently. Look at the execution of TSLA and compare it to its Western competitors they aren t even in the same league.,reddit,0.9744,0.115,0.08,0.805,0.061102449893951416,0.03226494789123535,0.9066326022148132,positive,neutral
2025-01-27,Third Coast Bancshares Continued Growth In A Booming Region I have been covering numerous small mid cap banks for quite some time now and I am bullish on the continued growth of many names. TCBX is based in the high growth Texas metropolitan areas with very impressive growth despite the fact Texas has more banks than any other state. Here is my analysis on this particular community bank Hope to hear from everyone on their thoughts on this company the future outlook on financials Macro Overview Economic Strength of Texas Third Coast operates in Texas whom remain one of the fastest growing states in the U.S. that recently faster than the nation as a whole. Business friendly policies like no state income tax have helped corporate relocation s like Tesla Oracle and Hewlett Packard. Texas s economy is the when compared to nations of the world and is now valued at $2.6 trillion. Texas is expected to continue to grow and with that the need for lending capabilities should favor Third Coast. Impact of Potential Deregulation in the new administrations economic agenda. For community banks like Third Coast this will allow them the ability to operate more freely with relaxed capital requirements. With fewer regulatory requirements Third Coast can selectively increase their exposure to higher yielding loans and potential acquisitions. Typically the ability to freely lend boosts bank earnings and growth. It allows the industry the flexibility to regulate themselves. With deregulation almost certain focusing on further risk taking is important. This approach may lead to increases in nonperforming loans down the line. Investment Thesis Presence In A High Growth Region Texas has one of the strongest economies in the U.S. consistently outpacing the national GDP growth rate. Third Coast has shown a great track record of impressive growth with a CAGR of over 25 and EPS growth of over 18 from 2020 to 2024. Deregulation in the banking industry is all but certain in the coming months. This will lead to increased lending capabilities that will fuel additional growth in a region that continues to outperform. Third Coast s lending increased 9 to $3.97 billion. Urban centers like Austin Dallas Fort Worth and Houston are hubs for technology energy and manufacturing. In particular residential construction is anticipated to rebound in 2025 fueled by increased populations jobs and incomes. Current Valuation Third Coast has a P E of 14.65 slightly below the Yet the stock has risen over 93 in the last year alone and is just 2.5 from its 52 week high of $37.65. Despite the significant increase Third Coast is still slightly undervalued. It is significantly under their five year average high P E of 16.9. With continued growth expected in the long term we believe it is best to either wait for a potential pullback or continue holding. Strong Financial Results Fierce competition in Texas is intense with hundreds of banks. Nevertheless Third Coast has achieved impressive results since their 2021 IPO. Revenue has increased 80 EPS 194 and net income 317 . Profitability metrics like return on average assets return on average equity and net profit margin have set new records. They have hit highs of 1.05 11.48 and 27.82 respectively. Nonperforming assets did however increase by 48.7 to 0.58 of total assets. While increases are not desired the total is still significantly under the industry average indicating proper risk management for now. Loan Growth Quality Nonperforming loans Often solid loan growth comes with risky lending practices. Third Coast predominately lends to CRE and C I combined accounting for almost 60 of the total portfolio. Nonperforming loans increased by 61.4 to $27.95 million. A large reason for such a major increase stemmed from C I accounting for over 51 of nonperforming loans. Non farm non residential owner occupied loans accounted for 39 . Fortunately non farm non residential owner occupied loans decreased 14 despite their 11.3 weighting. Nonperforming assets Unsurprisingly nonperforming assets increased by 48.7 as a result. Currently nonperforming assets are only at 0.58 which is still minor for a community bank. We do not want to see a continuation of nonperforming assets. They can easily start to wipe out a bank s equity. Third Coast has grown fantastically as has nonperforming loans and assets. Both are now at all time highs for the banks. We will be monitoring this development in the upcoming quarters to ensure this does not rapidly continue. Earnings Overview Revenue Fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 16 to $171.38 million. Third Coast benefited from a 15.2 increase in net interest income due to elevated interest rates. This allowed the bank to reprice loans at higher yields. Floating rate loans especially boosted interest income despite rising deposit costs. Total non interest income also saw impressive growth of 29.4 to $10.62 million contributing to the overall increase in revenue. Net Income An impressive increase of 42.7 lead to a total of $47.67 million. This increase was primarily the result of increased net interest income resulting from loan growth. EPS Earnings per share saw strength with growth of 40.4 to $2.78. Higher revenue controlled cost management and rising profitability were the primarily reasons for such an increase.,reddit,0.9996,0.229,0.018,0.753,0.895439624786377,0.009921442717313766,0.0946388989686966,positive,positive

The firm invests in diversified asset categories including listed and unlisted equities and private equity investments. The company was founded on October 29 1904 and is headquartered in Sydney Australia. Historical Financial Analysis The company experienced a remarkable operational transformation in 2021 following its recapitalization in 2020. Prior to this change the company boasted a robust revenue stream generating nearly $40 million from various segments including Building Products Healthcare and Health Beauty. However despite this substantial revenue the company faced challenges in achieving healthy profit margins. Since 2021 although revenues have decreased and are now solely derived from its investment portfolio the company has managed to report impressive profits amounting to $8.17 million in 2023 compared to only $1.1 million in 2019 despite revenues of only $5.58 million. The recapitalization also positively impacted the company s balance sheet allowing for a significant increase in assets from $35 million in 2020 to $70 million in 2023. Concurrently liabilities which stood at nearly $20 million in 2020 have diminished to less than $1 million thereby substantially improving the book value for shareholders. Growth Catalyst The recent acquisition of Schoolblazer by the company following its increased investment in Mountcastle to achieve full ownership represents a strategically advantageous decision. This acquisition is anticipated to enable the company to capture a substantially larger portion of the market as Schoolblazer is strategically aligned with core competencies that Mountcastle currently lacks and vice versa. The synergy between these complementary business models is expected to lead to a significant increase in market share for Mountcastle especially considering that Schoolblazer expands Mountcastle s footprint from the Value and Mid consumer market segments through its established presence in the Premium market segment.,reddit,0.9992,0.161,0.014,0.825,0.8673104047775269,0.09507308155298233,0.037616461515426636,positive,positive

Concerns over DeepSeek came to a head on Monday with the Nasdaq Composite losing more than 3 while the S P 500 slid about 1.5 .

DeepSeek surpassed rival OpenAI on Monday to become the most downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple s App Store. Valuations remain extended and while vulnerabilities were expected this year developments like DeepSeek highlight the need for diversification beyond the Mag Seven said Seema Shah chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.

2025-01-28,Elon Musk Tried to Pressure Norway s Wealth Fund A Major Tesla Shareholder to Approve His Compensation Package Recently disclosed text messages reveal that Elon Musk tried to sway Norway s massive sovereign wealth fund commonly known as the Oil Fund to support his controversial Tesla pay package. The fund which manages assets of around USD 1.8 trillion and holds a significant stake in Tesla voted against Musk s compensation proposal prompting him to admonish CEO Nicolai Tangen not to request any favors until making amends. In their exchange Musk also accused Tangen of leaking the texts to the media after Norwegian outlets reported on his canceled dinner appearance at the Oil Fund s investment conference. Tangen countered that Norway s strict transparency laws akin to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act required partial disclosure including confirmation that Musk would not attend. Initially the Oil Fund classified much of the conversation as private and withheld it. However in the spirit of transparency they eventually released all texts. The incident highlights the tension between Musk s calls for discretion and the Norwegian Oil Fund s legal obligations to remain open. While emphasizing a positive relationship with Tesla as a critical investment the fund has reiterated its opposition to Musk s pay plan.,reddit,0.9186,0.11,0.058,0.832,0.021417370066046715,0.8663309216499329,0.1122516393661499,positive,negative

2025-01-29,Tesla s Earning Reports are Useless With the current political and regulatory environment it s becoming clear that Elon Musk and Tesla can get away with as much fraud as they want. The SEC DOJ and other oversight agencies have either been neutered or are unwilling to go after him in any meaningful way. The latest earnings reports Might as well be fiction. We ve already seen Tesla repeatedly overpromise and underdeliver whether it s FSD production numbers or financial projections. But now with regulators looking the other way and politicians either enabling or actively shielding Musk there are effectively no consequences for misleading investors. If there s no real enforcement what s stopping Tesla from manipulating numbers to prop up the stock And if investors and analysts just keep buying into the hype regardless of fundamentals what s the point of even pretending these earnings reports mean anything At this point Tesla s valuation has become a faith based system rather than one grounded in financial reality.

2025-01-29,Considering TSLA Earnings today I m re writing to better along with WSB s rules. I haven t really made a text post here before but I ve seen the type of DD posted here and wanted to put in my own thoughts and get everyone s idea on Tesla s earnings today. I m not here to suggest plays or talk about Elon s Tweets. Just the raw facts and what people think of the stock. First off Tesla is expected to report an adjusted profit of 77 cents per share with sales at $27.2 billion. That s a step up from last year s 71 cents per share and $25.2 billion in sales. That s pretty good. In Q4 2024 Tesla cranked out approximately 459 000 vehicles and delivered over 495 000. While these are record numbers they still fell short of the ambitious targets set by the Musk himself. That being said these are all previous numbers and we need to try to predict today s numbers. With expectations so high it might be difficult to beat earnings tonight. We need to address the new administration obviously. They re going to be phasing out EV incentives so Tesla s projected sales might not be as high as we think. Elon has been touting a 20 30 sales growth for 2025 but with reduced EV demand and competition from China... it might not be realistic. Tesla might announce advancements in autonomous driving and upcoming product launches to keep the momentum going. A lower priced EV updated models and the potential rollout of Full Self Driving and robotaxi services are all in the pipeline. If Tesla can pull these off it might just silence the haters and send the shorts running for cover. However considering the last 10 years of improvements it s highly unlikely. Now consider what I ve written above and the fact that the stock has dropped drastically 5 out of 7 previous earnings.

2025-01-29,Let s talk about META s earnings. Zuckerberg s earnings are today and I wanted to drop my 2 cents and see if anyone s up to discuss. I m re writing to better along with WSB s rules. I recently tried to make a post about Tesla but it was taken down too by an AI bot for being too political This is my first discussion post so I m really testing out the waters on this sub. Meta Platforms is set to announce its fourth quarter results after the market closes and from what I ve read analysts are predicting earnings of $6.76 per share up from $5.33 a year ago. Revenue is expected to hit $47.04 billion marking a 17 increase year over year. Right now it seems like people are particularly keen to see how Meta s hefty investments in artificial intelligence are paying off. Unfortunately for Meta DeepSeek has been making waves with its R1 model. It s a Chinese competitor that matches the capabilities of models from U.S. giants like OpenAI and Meta but was developed at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek s success has sent shockwaves through the tech industry causing significant stock drops for companies like Nvidia. It s pretty common for China to steal proprietary tech and incorporate it into their own creations but their AI is entirely open source unlike OpenAI. This would allow American companies to in turn take their new research and work with it. For those who don t know Meta themselves has an Open Source Strategy. Their Cheif AI Scientist Yann LeCun isn t sweating it though. DeepSeek s R1 is open source just like Meta s own Llama model which in turn validates Meta s open source approach. Collaboration and transparency might be the goal in the AI race. However people are wondering how such advancements could be made with such a low budget. This puts into question the amount of funding and money that s currently going into AI. Despite the DeepSeek induced drop Meta s stock has shown resilience. Analysts at Citi argue that Meta could actually benefit from DeepSeek s innovations by incorporating them to enhance its own AI tools potentially leading to more efficient operations and better returns on investment. As Meta prepares to unveil its earnings everyone wants to see how the company plans to monetize its AI investments and respond to the rising competition from players like DeepSeek. The tech landscape is shifting and Meta s next moves could set the tone for the industry s future. But the earning call won t be entirely about AI. They obviously own Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp. Advertising remains the cornerstone of Meta s revenue accounting for approximately 98 of its total income. I believe Meta s significant investments in artificial intelligence have enhanced its advertising capabilities. AI powered tools like Advantage and generative AI enable advertisers to create highly targeted campaigns leading to increased return on ad spend. The company reported a 7 year over year increase in ad impressions and an 11 rise in average ad prices. Over a million businesses utilized Meta s generative AI tools to produce 15 million ads in a single month resulting in a 7 uplift in conversions. Meta s platforms continue to see robust user engagement. The company boasts 3.29 billion daily active users a 5 increase from the previous year. AI enhanced content recommendations have driven higher engagement particularly for video content thereby boosting advertising opportunities. However Despite these positive indicators Meta faces several challenges. The company s Reality Labs division focused on metaverse initiatives is expected to report a $5 billion loss for Q4 continuing to weigh on overall profitability. Additionally regulatory scrutiny such as the European Union s Digital Markets Act poses risks to Meta s data driven advertising model potentially leading to increased compliance costs and fines. Competition from platforms like TikTok Google and Amazon remains intense with TikTok s popularity among younger users particularly threatening Meta s growth in key demographics. Although Tiktok s impending ban might really help them monopolize the social media industry. Everything is telling me that earnings will be bullish.

ELI5 Why Kodak is a Good Investment Right Now Imagine you have an old company like Kodak which used to make cameras and films. People think it s outdated but here s the secret Kodak is quietly transforming into something much bigger. And Wall Street isn t paying attention yet . Here s why smart investors might want to take a closer look at Kodak 1 Kodak Is Getting Into Pharmaceuticals Kodak is building a factory to make ingredients for medicines. This new business starts in 2025 and will make a lot more money per dollar spent than selling old school film and prints. Think of it like Kodak switching from selling DVDs to streaming movies it s the future This new drug business could bring in over $250M a year in just a few years. 2 Kodak Is Paying Off a TON of Debt Kodak had a special pension fund with $1.08 BILLION saved up. They will use $315M to pay down debt meaning they don t have to pay as much interest anymore . This frees up an extra $25M per year Less debt stronger company more money to grow the business . 3 Hidden Gold Mine Kodak Owns a HUGE Industrial Park Kodak owns Eastman Business Park a 1 200 acre industrial site. Right now it s on the books for only $60M but it s actually worth $175M . If they sell or rent out more space Kodak could make a lot of extra money . 4 The Government Might Help Kodak The U.S. wants to make more stuff at home . Kodak makes things in America which means they could get government support and win new contracts. If new tariffs happen Kodak s U.S. made products become more valuable . 5 Kodak s Stock Is TOO CHEAP Right now Kodak is trading at $6.79 per share. Experts say it should be worth between $11.50 $24.00 per share That means the stock could DOUBLE or even TRIPLE in price. What s Next Kodak is no longer just an old camera company. With pharma real estate and smart debt moves it could become a big winner in the next couple of years. New drug business more profits Less debt more cash to grow Hidden assets even more value Government policies possible tailwinds Right now Wall Street isn t paying attention but soon they might.

2025-01-29,Wednesday s Pre Market News Stock Movers morning traders and investors of the r stocks sub Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start Here are your pre market stock movers news on this Wednesday January the 29th 2025 Stock futures were near the flatline on Wednesday as investors turned toward the first Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2025. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched down 13 points. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.3 higher while S P 500 futures was trading around the flatline. Tech stocks on Tuesday led the S P 500 higher and brought the Nasdaq Composite to a 2 gain. The two indexes made a comeback after incurring sharp losses on Monday in a sell off spurred by the emergence of China s DeepSeek and the threat it poses to the artificial intelligence trade. Nvidia which suffered a roughly 17 decline Monday jumped nearly 9 on Tuesday. As far as the DeepSeek news over the weekend at the end of the day today there really hasn t been that much of an impact on a market wide basis Bespoke Investment Group co founder Paul Hickey said Tuesday on CNBC s Closing Bell Overtime. The Fed s interest rate decision on Wednesday is now a focal point for investors as well as Fed Chair Jerome Powell s press conference. Fed funds futures data reflect a nearly 100 certainty that the central bank will keep rates steady at a target range of 4.25 to 4.5 according to CME Group data. When it comes to the Fed they re widely not expected to do anything tomorrow and that s a good thing. The less the Fed has to do the better it is for the market in our view Hickey added. Investors will be paying especially close attention to Powell s comments his first press conference in President Donald Trump s second term. The two have had a contentious relationship dating back to Trump s first term. The president has already said he would demand that interest rates drop immediately.

2025-01-29,Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones Thoughts Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business TMUS and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ T other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won t hold my breath. Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software providing an alternative to the company s in house satellite communication service. The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under the radar move the smartphone s latest software update released Monday now supports the technology. The tie up comes as a surprise T Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple meanwhile already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range. T Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test. The first users received text messages from T Mobile saying You re in the T Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond please update to iOS 18.3. Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment while T Mobile said that the test will begin with select optimized smartphones and that the full launch will support the vast majority of modern smartphones. T Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15 the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn t immediately respond to a request for comment. Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022 there s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple s 2022 announcement Musk posted on X that his company has had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity. Here s how it will work When a T Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple. The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple s Globalstar service which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally. There s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option meanwhile is designed to work automatically even when the phone is in a customer s pocket. Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off the grid areas such as hiking trails that don t have cellular service. The capabilities can t be used in places where a mobile phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year Bloomberg News has reported. T Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now the number of users in the beta is minimal with T Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes but it didn t disclose the Starlink support. SpaceX requested authority to begin beta testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T Mobile s cellular network in November.

2025-01-30,QQQ up with trash Q1 estimates puts at open Pulled out of the market yesterday. But a few interesting observations everybody missed Q1 top line forecasts on growth. Meta and Tesla crashed on earnings drop due to missing Q1 forecasts before recovering. Microsoft crashed after Q1 forecast released on earnings call. Microsoft hinted data center computing execution driving capacity constraints through Q1 mirroring reports of Blackwell chips overheating earlier this year. Not surprisingly Deepseek inference cost reduction implications due to MOE approach yet to be factored in capex estimates seem to be in line with end of year plans. Apple on deck today. Profitability expected to be good due to efficiency in production but Q1 forecasted top line also expected to be trash due to China and Apple intelligence failing. Still a believer in big tech but current multiples are historically high with interest rates still near historic highs in the near future which implies expectations of meteoric growth. There seems to be hell of a lot of risk in the market for big bets that won t play out for at least 6 months. If this pump holds up QQQ 2 14 520P To be clear not all bad news. Killer profitability from Meta and Musk did a masterpiece on painting the future of FSD and Optimus sooner than we thought but that s what Musk does. And Netflix crushed it.

2025-01-30,Am I the only one that feels the market makes no sense right now Ok so basically what I am trying to say is How in the world did Tesla just go up after missing the Earnings and all the stuff that s happened recently with Elon s salute and everything. I know tesla was never an automotive company and it is also in my opinion the most overvalued company on the market right now but this just doesn t make any sense. Also Microsoft who beat the earning and also has a clear plan for this year just went down more than 6 . It just feels like the market is entirely random.

2025-01-30,1 30 Thursday s Pre Market News Stock Movers morning traders and investors of the r stocks sub Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start Here are your pre market stock movers news on this Thursday January the 30th 2025 S P 500 futures rose Thursday as Wall Street digested recent quarterly results from a slew of megacap tech companies. Investors are coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve held steady on rates. Futures tied to the broad market index added 0.3 while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5 . Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were fractionally lower. Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla gained 1 and 2 respectively while Microsoft shares dipped more than 4 after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines but Microsoft shares faltered after the company s quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. On the other hand revenue misses from UPS and Caterpillar weighed the indexes down. Other Magnificent Seven names are set to report in the coming days with Apple s results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit as the megacap tech company reports next week. On Wednesday all three major averages ended the session lower as a 4 decline in Nvidia weighed on the market. The declines came after the Fed paused its interest rate cutting campaign leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25 and 4.5 . In their post meeting statement policymakers noted that inflation remains somewhat elevated. The implication is that we re on hold until the inflation rate goes down and unfortunately it s probably not going to go down very much in the several months ahead so I wouldn t be looking for rate cuts at the next meeting Jeffrey Gundlach DoubleLine Capital CEO said Wednesday on CNBC s Closing Bell. We have a relatively stable place where we re standing and it kind of supports the fact that the market is in a calm position right now and so is Powell apparently he said. On the economic data front the fourth quarter gross domestic product reading is due on Thursday and weekly jobless claims are out in the morning. Investors are also looking ahead to Friday s personal consumption expenditures price index report for December.

2025-01-30,These are the stocks on my watchlist This is a daily watchlist for short term trading I might trade all none of the stocks listed and even stocks not listed I am targeting potentially good candidates for short term trading I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting everything else is secondary. Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form more detailed catalyst examinations over the short form with more tickers. Ticker Catalyst Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B but guided revenue short of consensus and didn t provide FY25 revenue outlook . Their CAPEX announcement was $60 65B vs $52.4B expected and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation. Also announced plans to grow META s AI team significantly. Volume Market Cap Technicals Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that. Context Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye popping CAPEX number and selling the company. Sector Context There is a major next level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama which is another open source model compared to OpenAI s closed models. Risks Deepseek has been the main threat involved with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. Related Tickers FAANG stocks SNAP PINS etc. Offhand Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable. Ticker Catalyst Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn t give specific details regarding the production volume targets and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo UBER. Personally I think the vision only approach is not viable in the long run but hey I m no self driving PHD. CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity. Volume Market Cap Technicals I m mainly interested in the $375 $400 level not too interested in going long despite the multi day slide in price. Context Main reason for TSLA s selloff was the lack of full year guidance . Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA. Sector Context Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower than expected vehicle deliveries increased sale incentives 496K cars vs 507K exp. China s BYD is rapidly catching up and the removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV s more expensive Risks Mainly geopolitical if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk. Related Tickers BYD Catalyst The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there s a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus. Yesterday after the close there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia s China sales. Volume Market Cap Technicals Overall there s been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116 but low confidence we ll sell off again. Currently long. Sector Context Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

2025-01-30,Elon indicating battery production issues in earnings call today. Could possible acquisition be a solution for Tesla TO ALL MY HIGH RISK SPECULATIVE INVESTORS I know some of you have probably heard about this juicy rumor floating around that Tesla might be looking at acquiring $QS and if you haven t well its out there and Elon just stated the reason why on todays earnings call. Elon said Right now the constraint we re trying to solve is battery production rather than demand. So you know they re sweating bullets over their battery issues working overtime to fix this shit. Now the issue is that Elon Musk has historically been content with lithium ion batteries for Tesla s vehicles citing the cost implications of adopting solid state technology at scale. So in order for this rumor to come true and for QS to send us regards to the multi millionaire club QS must be able to have a revolutionary solid state Lithium battery AND be able to show that these batteries can be mass produced cheaply at a large scale. Just to be crystal clear THIS IS A SUPER HIGH RISK play because there is a chance that $QS won t be able to figure out how to make these batteries affordable. As always do your DD before you buy. Volkswagen has already made significant investments into $QS but who the tf wants to drive an electric VW loaded with top of the line revolutionary batteries anyways Position I m starting with 1000 shares for now but I am ready to increase the size of this bag if it starts heating up $QS $QS $QS,reddit,0.9511,0.111,0.026,0.863,0.17480292916297913,0.01971718668937683,0.805479884147644,positive,neutral

2025-01-30,These are the stocks on my watchlist Hi I am an ex prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short term trading I might trade all none of the stocks listed and even stocks not listed I am targeting potentially good candidates for short term trading I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting everything else is secondary. Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form more detailed catalyst examinations over the short form with more tickers. News Ticker Catalyst Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B but guided revenue short of consensus and didn t provide FY25 revenue outlook . Their CAPEX announcement was $60 65B vs $52.4B expected and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation. Also announced plans to grow META s AI team significantly. Volume Market Cap Technicals Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that. Context Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye popping CAPEX number and selling the company. Sector Context There is a major next level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama which is another open source model compared to OpenAI s closed models. Risks Deepseek has been the main threat involved with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. Related Tickers FAANG stocks SNAP PINS etc. Offhand Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable. Ticker Catalyst Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn t give specific details regarding the production volume targets and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo UBER. Personally I think the vision only approach is not viable in the long run but hey I m no self driving PHD. CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity. Volume Market Cap Technicals I m mainly interested in the $375 $400 level not too interested in going long despite the multi day slide in price. Context Main reason for TSLA s selloff was the lack of full year guidance . Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA. Sector Context Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower than expected vehicle deliveries increased sale incentives 496K cars vs 507K exp. China s BYD is rapidly catching up and the removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV s more expensive Risks Mainly geopolitical if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk. Related Tickers BYD Catalyst The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there s a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus. Yesterday after the close there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia s China sales. Volume Market Cap Technicals Overall there s been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116 but low confidence we ll sell off again. Currently long. Sector Context Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously. Risks Mainly geopolitical again. Obviously it s very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

2025-01-30,Hardware 3 Is Useless for Autonomy Implications I don t get how everyone s glossing over the fact that Elon literally admitted Hardware 3 won t cut it for self driving. For years we heard flip of a switch and boom your Tesla s a robotaxi. Now it s Oh you actually need Hardware 4 . Meanwhile there aren t even that many Hardware 4 cars on the road and full autonomy definitely isn t happening in six months. They re supposedly starting in Austin probably with a safety driver babysitting the whole thing and it ll be a very slow ramp assuming they can scale at all. Musk also admitted training Optimus is a much bigger lift than he let on. If FSD is any indication we are a longggg way off. So what exactly are people investing in at this point The numbers suck most of their earnings are from regulatory credits and Bitcoin and the stock price is propped up by hype and promises that keep shifting.
