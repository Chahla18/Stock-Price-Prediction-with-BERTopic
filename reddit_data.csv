They are setting up ""war rooms"" to figure out how DeepSeek AI cut cost, beating  all benchmarks jumping them to #1 in performance out the gate. DeepSeek is using throttled down Nvidia H800 GPU. Less power, less GPU server hardware, custom software to help efficiency = Better Performance. I Think  its time for some short term puts. Here's the Fortune article for refrence

2025-01-27,23:18:07,WallStreetBets,Nvidia‚Äôs $590 Billion DeepSeek Rout Is Largest in Market History,"ALTERNATIVE SOURCE ‚Äî Bloomberg: Nvidia Corp.‚Äôs plunge, fueled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the world‚Äôs largest company. 

Nvidia shares tumbled 17% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020, erasing $589 billion from the company‚Äôs market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record ‚Äî a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value ‚Äî and was the biggest in US stock-market history. 

The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Monday‚Äôs slump, Nvidia selloffs have caused eight of the top ten biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell 1.5% Monday and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3%.

The semiconductor maker led a broader selloff in technology stocks after DeepSeek‚Äôs low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing artificial intelligence. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price. 

The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Apple Inc.‚Äôs App Store rankings. 

‚ÄúConcerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,‚Äù Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients.

Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because they design semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that aren‚Äôt showing a sufficient return on the investment. 

Meta announced plans on Friday to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as $65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. announcing a $100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centers and AI infrastructure projects around the US. 

In a bid to stall China‚Äôs progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeek‚Äôs progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources.

Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek‚Äôs model is an ‚Äúexcellent AI advancement‚Äù and indicated that the Chinese company didn‚Äôt violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, requires ‚Äúrequires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.‚Äù

2025-01-27,22:08:45,WallStreetBets,"NVDA PUTS (+400% gain available): +$500B of customer cancellations ""pauses"" incoming","Important disclaimers: you will not find a bigger AI believer than me. Not even Sam Altman. I work at an AI startup and I code AI projects on my free time for fun. Also, nothing here is financial advice. 

However, if someone told you that a company will have massive customer orders cancelled, what should happen to the stock price of that company? 

It just doesn't get any more simple than this.   
  
DeepSeek beat OpenAI's best model ""gpt o1"" while only spending $5.5m USD on NVIDIA GPUs, meanwhile OpenAI is spending BILLIONS of dollars on NVIDIA GPUs. To give some perspective on how absurd that is, look at this screenshot of what this Meta employee said - basically some managers at Meta get paid MORE than how much it cost DeepSeek to make *arguably* one of the best AI models on the planet. No need to take our word for it, just google Deepseek and compare the quality of R1 to ChatGPT yourself, thats what I did. 

[Meta employee discusses impact of DeepSeek on Meta AI](https://preview.redd.it/s67zjw6uklfe1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=c86e3d81eefa5f961597057827aed31dd1faefcc)

  
Deepseek's R1 is much better than OpenAI's o1 and I've switched personally and the startup I'm at is switching too, especially considering that it costs \~96% less than OpenAI's API cost... it's a no-brainer.  
  
***Put simply, if everyone copies Deepseek's opensource handbook on how to save billions of dollars in GPU costs, then that means there is immediately a massive, massive GPU surplus right now in AI land, by several orders of magnitude. So, if you can build a world-leading AI for $5.5m USD, instead of spending $5 billion to build it, you're just not going to buy more GPUs from NVIDIA for the foreseeable future. Remember, NVIDIA's market cap is $3 trillion so they are priced for 100s of billions of dollars of GPU demand.***  
  
There are only 2 scenarios in which this play loses money: 1. people don't care about money anymore. Or 2. Deepseek's costs numbers are fabricated. I doubt they lied about costs because they open sourced everything and walked everyone through how they did it. If you want to take a closer look, here's Ben Thompson's [review and analysis](https://stratechery.com/2025/deepseek-faq/) of Deepseek's costs.[](https://stratechery.com/2025/deepseek-faq/)  
  
400% gain is available from these NVDA puts. The main catalyst that I expect will happen any day now (or could take up to a few weeks) is when the big customers of NVIDIA like ""Stargate"", OpenAI, Microsoft, etc start saying, ""oh we're going to pause +$500B worth of GPU orders just to review if we're doing this right, thank you"".   
  
When that happens, the stock will fall another -40% or more, and these puts will rise +300%.

2025-01-27,20:32:20,WallStreetBets,China is absolutely cooking and nobody outside China has any idea,"Ok so for reference, I don't live in China and I'm not chinese, but I can read and speak Chinese decently. Also I'm obsessed with Chinese technology and science for years now. I spent a lot of my free time scrawling the Chinese internet for news since 2016. Really technical stuff, company earning calls, patents filing, press releases, interviews, official government news, technical papers in journals that barely anyone has heard off, random rumors spread by well know industry figures. Really really dry and boring stuff. And here's the thing, there's a fuck ton of information about China that anybody can access, but nobody does, just because it's in Chinese and it's buried in journals and whatnot. Even things that really should be top secret can be found. For example, the two 6th gen fighters that flew in China last month, while it came out as a shock to everyone outside China, within the chinese internet, there was massive rumours about their maiden flights, almost two months before the actual flight. Pretty much all the chinese military fans knew to almost the exact date when those two fighters were going to fly. And after that, they dug up old technical papers in some military journals that were freely available and found out that those papers were describing systems that those planes were using. Again, this kind of stuff really really should be top secret, but with a lot of digging, you can find it freely. Even super duper ultra top secret stuff, like their EUV development, there's enough news that you can get a pretty clear picture if you really dig hard enough.

There's tons of other examples. Deepseek surprised the Western world, but they were already hottest A.I company in China since mid-2024, everyone in China could tell that there was something special about them and they were probably gonna lead the Chinese A.I companies despite their small size and inexperience. SMIC shocked America when they released their 7nm chips in 2023, but ever since 2019, SMIC has always said in their roadmap and earning call that they were aiming for 7nm and confident that they could do it. Nobody in America bothered to actually read their earning call I guess. Huawei shocked the world when they made their big comeback, but anyone in the weeds could see their massive investments and effort to keep themselves afloat and pull ahead of the sanctions.

But my main point here is that there's a ton of development going on in China right now. From private companies, to massive state backed science/infrastructure projects, China is cooking hard. There's so much activity going on in China right now, most of which are massive gamechangers and will have a massive impact on the world. Some will come out the next few years, and others will take a decade to mature. But a lot of them will likely have the same impact as Deepseek has had on the A.I industry. And all the info is there in Chinese, you can read up on all the details years before they actually happen.

But nobody is paying close attention to Chinese development, hence why everyone is so shocked whenever China makes a big breakthrough out of the blue. It's never out of the blue btw. There's always a massive paper trail in the chinese internet of the developmental process before it hits the mainstream english media. Translation software is already extremely good, I highly suggest that you take some time and actually go on a trek in the chinese internet if you want to see what the cutting edge in technology development is and keep up to date.

2025-01-27,20:10:57,WallStreetBets,Deepseek is good for $NVDA - Here's why,"So unless you've been living under a rock, NVIDIA's stock just took a massive hit (-16%) after this Chinese company DeepSeek dropped what might be the biggest AI flex of 2025: They supposedly built a GPT-4 level model for just $6M. Not billion. Million. Using old NVIDIA hardware that China's not even supposed to have anymore.

I've been following the AI space for a while, and this is wild for a few reasons:

First off, this is basically like someone saying they built a Ferrari in their garage for the price of a used Civic. Everyone's freaking out because if these folks really pulled this off with older GPUs (H800s/A100s), what's even the point of dropping $30k+ on new H100s?

The Elon drama isn't helping either - my man's out here claiming DeepSeek's got 50k illegal H100s stashed under some boba shop in Shenzhen üíÄ

But here's where it gets interesting - there's this old economic concept called Jevons Paradox (bear with me). Basically, when something gets more efficient/cheaper, people end up using MORE of it, not less. Think about when coal got more efficient in the 1800s - instead of using less coal, suddenly everything and their mother was running on steam power.

So here's my spicy take: What if cheaper AI training is actually GOOD for NVIDIA? Follow me here:

* If building AI models gets stupid cheap, every CS dropout with a dream is gonna try launching an AI startup
* All those AIs need somewhere to actually run (inference)
* And guess who makes the best chips for running AI? Our boys in green

I mean, Zuck just committed $65B to AI infrastructure. My man's buying GPUs like they're Taylor Swift tickets lmao

That said, I'm the same idiot who bought AMD at the top, so maybe take this with a grain of salt ü§°

Curious what you all think:

* Are we witnessing the end of NVIDIA's AI dominance or is this a massive overreaction?
* If China's doing this much with old hardware, how screwed is Silicon Valley?
* Is your portfolio also on fire or did you actually listen to your financial advisor?

2025-01-27,15:05:55,WallStreetBets,NVDA‚Äôs DeepSeek Sell-Off: This Is a Jevons Paradox Buying Opportunity,"NVIDIA (NVDA) is down hard, dropping from $142 to $126 pre-market after hype around DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup achieving more with less compute. The market fears efficient AI models will hurt GPU demand, but this reaction misses the bigger picture.

Why This Is Bullish Long-Term
	1.	Jevons Paradox: Efficiency doesn‚Äôt reduce demand‚Äîit increases it. As AI becomes cheaper and more accessible, more businesses, startups, and individuals will adopt it, driving more GPU sales.
	2.	New Markets: Efficient models mean more local AI deployments (edge computing) and new industries adopting AI. NVIDIA‚Äôs products (DGX, Jetson, RTX GPUs) are perfectly positioned for this shift.
	3.	Redistribution, Not Decline: The demand for AI is evolving, not shrinking. NVIDIA will sell to thousands of smaller players, adding to their hyperscaler business.
	4.	Software Moat: CUDA and TensorRT ensure NVIDIA stays at the center of AI workflows, even as the market shifts.

At $126, this is classic overreaction. AI isn‚Äôt slowing‚Äîit‚Äôs expanding. NVDA is still the backbone of the industry, and this dip is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.

TL;DR: DeepSeek highlights AI‚Äôs growth, not NVIDIA‚Äôs decline. Efficiency drives broader adoption, and NVDA‚Äôs hardware/software dominance makes them a winner. Thoughts? Buying the dip?",NVDA,NVIDIA
2025-01-27,14:55:01,WallStreetBets,Sell side analyst notes on NVDA this morning,"BofA: 'DeepSeek Concerns Overblown in AI Semis; but Foundational Models Keep Demand High'

 ""On January 20, China-based AI lab DeepSeek created a mini-flurry in the AI semiconductor space by releasing a free, open-source R1 model that reportedly outperforms leading Western AI models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4. The model's creators claimed it took only two months and less than $6 million to build using older-generation NVIDIA H800 chips.

If accurate, this advancement suggests model usefulness and accuracy might not scale directly with compute/memory/networking, potentially reducing the demand for expensive AI chips. However, we believe this concern about slowing AI scaling is overstated. Based on available data, DeepSeek's model appears to be a 'distilled' model relying on larger foundation models like Meta's open-source Llama.

It is these foundational LLMs where significant and rising infrastructure costs are incurred, as evidenced by Meta's plan to raise CY25E capex by over 56% year-over-year to $60-$65 billion. In our view, we will continue to see increasing compute demand driven by a mix of large foundational models (both proprietary and open-source), derivative models (leveraging techniques such as knowledge distillation, sparse attention, and low-rank factorization), and inference at scale across diverse cloud, enterprise, and sovereign AI customers.

We maintain our Buy ratings on NVIDIA (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Marvell Technology (MRVL).""

JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande: ""Investors are concerned that rather than impede China's progress in AI, the US restrictions have engendered innovation that has enabled the development of a model that prioritises efficiency. ... The news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of Microsoft, which is spending $80bn in '25, while Meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn. Open AI also announced that the Stargate project intends to invest $500m over the next four years building new AI infrastructure in the US. Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek's highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible."" 

Jefferies analyst Edison Lee: ""Re-evaluating computing power needs could cause 2026 AI Capex to fall (or not grow)...We believe DS's success could drive two possible industry strategies: 1) still pursue more computing power to drive even faster model improvements, and 2) refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026."" 

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon: ""Is DeepSeek doomsday for AI buildouts? We don't think so...we believe that 1) DeepSeek DID NOT ""build OpenAI for $5M""; 2) the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and 3) the resulting Twitterverse panic over the weekend seems overblown."" Though Rasgon acknowledged DeepSeek's models are good. The analyst kept his outperform ratings on Nvidia and Broadcom, advising clients not to buy into the doomsday scenarios. 

Citi analyst Malik: ""While the dominance of the US companies on the most advanced AI models could be potentially challenged, that said, we estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US' access to more advanced chips is an advantage. Thus, we don't expect leading AI companies would move away from more advanced GPUs."" Malik maintained a buy rating on Nvidia . 

Raymond James' semiconductor analyst Srini Pajjuri: ""If DeepSeek's innovations are adopted broadly, an argument can be made that model training costs could come down significantly even at U.S. hyperscalers, potentially raising questions about the need for 1-million XPU/GPU clusters as projected by some...: A more logical implication is that DeepSeek will drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers to leverage their key advantage (access to GPUs) to distance themselves from cheaper alternatives."" Pajjuri reiterated buy ratings on Nvidia and ASML. 

Cantor analyst C.J. Muse: ""Following release of DeepSeek's V3 LLM, there has been great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs. We think this view is farthest from the truth and that the announcement is actually very bullish with AGI seemingly closer to reality and Jevons Paradox almost certainly leading to the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.""

2025-01-24,21:17:55,WallStreetBets,DD: UiPath ($PATH) - Mispriced and Misunderstood,"I‚Äôm looking for the regardedest, lowest, humblest of you to confirm the way.

* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when I said PLTR bumpy revenues weren‚Äôt a concern (2022).
* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when I said get into Bitcoin before the wall street wave (2017).
* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when I said Tesla revenues were about to go parabolic (2017).

It‚Äôs true when they say Bears sound smart at parties, but the bulls make money.  Big brains are too smart for their own good, blowing up fears in their minds.

Why do I even posts?  Selfishly, to have a record (Reddit post history) of being right.  I love looking back and saying yep, yep, yep and laughing at big brains while wiping my ass with cash.  I didn‚Äôt go to Harvard or work for a big firm. I have a chip on my shoulder and I‚Äôm here to outclass them all.

So, fellow idiots, I think we have another winner. Time to get hyped.

UiPath ($PATH) $13.86 ($7.617B Market Cap).

**Big brains claim RPA is dead** (https://a16z.com/rip-to-rpa-the-rise-of-intelligent-automation/)

\-	Those pushing AI Agents and claiming RPA is dead are wrong. They assume AI Agents can be developed by skipping straight to step Z, when in reality, they will need to build steps A-Y. AI currently only has a brain. It needs hands and tools connected it to perform real work. UiPath has built out steps A-Y and is ready to take step Z. UiPath is in a position to capitalize on the power of Gen AI.

\-	There‚Äôs a spectrum of automation applications and RPA will still make the most sense in many use cases as the most efficient tool for the job (less processing, lower costs and more energy efficient).  AI Agents will have their place, but UiPath will have a system to orchestrate the spectrum of tools spanning from RPA, hybrid to advanced AI agents.

**Big brains claim UiPath has no moat.**

\-	UiPath‚Äôs product is more differentiated than the market gives them credit for.  The market seems to conflate all RPA vendors as interchangeable, but I believe there are nuanced and important differences between the offerings.  UiPath appears to be the most robust, user friendly and an innovation leader.

Where‚Äôs their moat?

1. Network effects. They have a large install base with 10,000+ customers (easy to upsell clients),
2. UiPath is immune to vendor locking (can automate across many different software provider applications).
3. Preferred vendor/partner to major consulting companies (EY, Deloitte, Accenture).
4. Existing partnerships with major software companies gives UiPath exposure to potential new customers.
5. UiPath has a large base of experienced RPA developers that prefer to use UiPath and who are likely to recommend it where they go.
6. Founder led.  Founder is a product focused engineer, not a career executive playing politics in a bureaucracy. This allows UiPath to be nimbler and seize market opportunities as they arise.

**Big brains claim UiPath‚Äôs growth story is over.**

\-	Gen AI can have a similar effect on UiPath as it did on Palantir and their AIP product. Gen AI will make the existing UiPath platform exponentially more powerful, meaning more and higher value use cases. As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate.

**Big brains have beaten this stock to death.**

\-	This stock is down from all time highs at $85.12/share in 2021 to less than $14/share today.

\-	Big brains seem to be discounting UiPath‚Äôs potential at a current price-to-sales multiple of 5.275x. SAAS companies can easily trade between 10-20x.

\-	UiPath has $1.6B in cash and $0 debt.

\-	82% gross margins.

\-	113% net dollar retention

\-	On the verge of flipping profitable.

\-	Guidance from last earnings call, they said ARR is expected to stabilize and free cash flow to accelerate.

TLDR:

My bet is UiPath has a greater than 50% chance for growth reacceleration.

UiPath product differentiation will become more apparent in the future.

As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate. (i.e. similar to PLTR with AIP).

None of this is financial advice. I may or may not know what I‚Äôm doing.

2025-01-22,03:19:40,WallStreetBets,"Intel will be the surprise overperformer in 2025, starting with the 1/30 ER.","Before I start, I want to preface this by acknowledging the memes and negative connection between intel and the one guy who lost his grandma's funds, but I genuinely believe with how low st. expectations are, combined with intel's massive sell-off these few months, Intel will skyrocket leading up/during the ER @ 1/30/2025.

# 1. Extremely heavy Investments in Manufacturing

* **Tens of Billions Invested**: Intel has invested heavily in manufacturing expansion, aiming to regain technological leadership. These investments are expected to start bearing fruit by 2026 and 2027, positioning Intel as a key U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturer.
   * Now I know ya'll are gonna complain, but that's 2026 and 2027, which is a long ways out! Here's the thing, as long as (they will) Intel acknowleges their progress towards manufacturing, and the expected returns of their investments, especially under the current administration, the upside will be more or less priced in within the report.
* **Alignment with U.S. Government Priorities**: U.S. policy encourages domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, especially with the new Mango administration.
   * It's pretty obvious that the current admin wants to become less dependent on foreign semiconductor manufacturing, and Intel's investments in the space PLUS mango being in power will undoubtedly be great for the stock, and I believe that's what Intel will lean into heavily during the upcoming earnings report with stellar guidance.

# 2. Undervalued Stock Price

* **Current Valuation**: Intel is trading at one of its lowest forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios of the year, at around 20.
* **Intrinsic Value**: Updated discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation indicates an intrinsic value of $36 per share, significantly higher than the current trading price of $19.82. While there may be some other factors, this suggests Intel is trading on a pretty steep discount compared to its market value, way less than other big names.

# 3. Advanced Developments

* **Advanced Node Development**: Intel is investing in advanced manufacturing nodes to close the gap with competitors like TSMC and Samsung. Success in these nodes will make Intel competitive in high-margin markets.
   * I'll admit, I'm not entirely familiar with the development process of these, but I can't imagine this not being bullish for the stock.
* **Gaudi AI Chips**: The release of competitive AI chips (e.g., Gaudi 3) positions Intel to capture a share of the rapidly growing AI market.

# 4. Reduced Competition in Dual Design-Manufacturing Model

* **Unique Positioning**: Intel and Micron remain the only U.S.-based companies pursuing both design and manufacturing, while most competitors focus on design alone. This vertical integration could yield huge advantages as Intel scales.
   * Again, I'm not familiar with the development of chips, but from what I could find, if Intel could pull this off in the long-run, it'll set itself in an extremely unique environment with both design and manufacturing WITHIN the United States. Would be huge for the nation-first agenda under the current administration.

# 5. Support from Geopolitical Tailwinds

* **CHIPS Act Benefits**: Intel is set to benefit from U.S. government incentives under the CHIPS Act, including grants and tax credits for domestic semiconductor manufacturing.
   * Again, huge for a US-based company like Intel.

# 6. Potential Leadership Turnaround

* **CEO Transition**: A change in leadership could bring new strategic clarity and execution capability, particularly in aligning investment timelines with profitability goals.
   * Though Pat was a pretty chill guy, if Intel could bring in someone with large amounts of industry experience, that's another huge upside potential for Intel. They may announce a new CEO during ER or somewhere near it, but I just can't imagine them settling with a mid-tier guy after what they've been through.

# 7. Market Share Opportunities

* **Competitor Weaknesses**: AMD and Nvidia focus on niche areas, leaving room for Intel to grow in data centers, personal computing, and automotive applications.
   * Yes, this does mean that their areas would be very hard to break into, but we've already seen Intel turning around in some aspects, especially their newer desktop gaming GPUs which actually bring in surprising value for performance beyond AMD and Nvidia comparable cards.
* **U.S. Government Contracts**: Intel‚Äôs U.S.-based manufacturing advantage makes it a preferred supplier for defense and other government projects, which is yet another large catalyst for the future.

# 8. Focused Financial Discipline

* **Cost Reductions**: Intel has paused dividends and reduced workforce to save over $10 billion by 2025, stabilizing its financial position during this investment-heavy period.
   * I expect to see this being reflected upon in the upcoming 1/30 ER. With a bit more cash freed up and stabilizing finances, I'm pretty confident that it'll be far beyond what the market has been pricing in which is arguably a worst case doomsday scenario.

# Conclusion

Yes, Intel does have a decent amount of debt. Yes, nana's son did lose hundreds of thousands. But it's objectively true that INTC has been beaten down mercilessly these past few months, with a 56% drawdown since the start of 2024. It's entirely possible- likely even- that this is a far overreaction, especially with INTC taking steps to improve leadership, control debts, free up cash, and invest in what's needed. Combine that with the new administration that went into power yesterday, focusing on heavy domestic production, I believe Intel will be the surprise overperformer for this year.

NFA. I hold around $10k in calls expiring next month after the ER, and I am planning on DCAing aggressively into shares to hold for a few years.

TLDR: Grandma died 8 years ago. Left me nothing. So I invested my own money. 

Here's why I like Intel:

* 2024 Q1 up 9% YOY
* Intel has been heavily investing and restructuring by building out the domestic foundry business to manufacture semiconductor chips for third party companies.
* With Intel 3 in production, leading-edge semiconductors are being manufactured in the US for the first time in a decade. Intel will regain process leadership as the Intel Foundry continues to grow.
* I think the fact that Intel is positioning itself to be the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US is massive. The US Gov is heavily prioritizing domestic semiconductor production and thus is heavily supporting Intel as a company with R&D funding.
* If NVIDIA or AMD are ever forced to change manufacturers due to rising tensions/war between China & Taiwan, Intel will likely be a sole or largest manufacturer for NVIDIA and AMD
* Intel has been heavily investing in R&D. 5.9B out of 12.7B of Q124 revenue was invested in R&D.
* Intel is on track to exceed its forecast of 40 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2024
* The Intel Gaudi 3AI accelerator is projected to deliver 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than NVIDIA H100 on leading AI models.
* Trading at Forward PE of 17.05
* Geopolitical tensions will ultimately work in Intel's favor more than any other company in this industry
* I like the stock and I think its really cheap rn :)",NVDA,NVIDIA

Key quote for the lazy from the podcast (PLUS TLDR below for the mega regards):

>We're going to run out of compute. It's actually a pretty shocking stat. High bandwidth memory is a bigger part of NVIDIA's COGS on GPUs than Taiwan SEMI is. And today, there's two companies that can make it, SK Hynix and Micron. We'll see if Samsung gets their act together. But HBM memory, it's in NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, Amazon Terraniums, and particularly in a world of test time Compute and inference being so important, High bandwidth memory is arguably more important than it ever was, and it's been sold out for the last two years.

The trend is your friend, and there is no trend quite like AI. What you may have missed is that there's a big shift in the AI space towards test time compute. That's the future of AI. All the recent advancements, and those on the horizon, are being driven by test time compute. Guess what's essential for test time compute. High bandwidth memory. And guess who is soon to be the number one producer? Micron. Need I say more? Oh yeah, they're also trading like a deep value stock despite insane forward earnings. Completely mispriced. Easy 2-5 bagger over the coming years.

TLDR: This ain't no meme stock, this is the future! High bandwidth memory (HBM, remember it) is gonna be the new buzzword thrown around with reckless abandon, and Micron is the only game in town (SK Hynix is irrelevant - they're un-American).

Introduction: I have been very lucky this year playing puts and calls. I am already up over $103k since 1/1 and I have the receipts. (See my post history for some) So cry me a river indeed.

Nearly every single play has been buying puts when things seem irrationally high, or buying calls when they've fallen too far? What is too far? Good question. But to play this, you need volume and volatility.

$CEG (Constellation Energy Group) has been the perfect trade for that this year. Four times on three separate days I've bought puts on their frothiness. Yesterday I made $20k off $CEG in about an hour. Good work if you can get it.

[CEG Puts have gotten me $35k in gains even though the stock is up.](https://preview.redd.it/qemqizdvhnde1.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=5152767c694055798a43636ece96772a6b02faa4)

So that brings us to today. It's Friday, 0 Day Expiration party time! This morning, lots of things are green, and meme stock Elon plaything Tesla is blowing up like a SpaceX rocket over the Carribean. I am ready to make a killing. It's up 5% from the previous day and, if my results this year are right, it's going to go down. Everything returns to the mean. Nothing finishes at the high of the day.

So I buy 200 Put options for $1.24 at $430. It's a $25k bet and my account is ready.

[TSLA looking frothy midway through the day as I buy puts at 430.](https://preview.redd.it/k67m63joinde1.png?width=464&format=png&auto=webp&s=47da208c002804913328eb67a5dc5b96ba08f465)

But it doesn't go down right away. This is fine, I tell myself as the stock goes up to 436, 437... So I decide to double down and buy 150 put options for $1.46 at $435. It's a $22k bet. I've now got $47k on the line, about half my gains on the year. If the stock traces back to $430, it'll be great. $425 would make serious coin.

But I forgot Tesla stock is fucking insane and every regard in this sub is jerking it to this chart.

[TSLA nears $440 with an hour left in trading and I am seriously boned.](https://preview.redd.it/bph2h3o8jnde1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fa161caad811a9726e6aae0d48320d99b096a05)

At this point, I have the live chart on my screen and I know I am going to eat shit and be down more than $40k and wipe out everything I've scammed for this year. Every time it comes down to 437, it goes back up to 439. 438. 439. 438. Stupid TSLA.

But wait! With an hour left it starts to fall, just like I thought it would. To $434 at least. My second buy is green more than $10k while my first one is pretty much toast. Every tick up or down is the worst. With less than an hour ago the flip flopping continues. $432. Back up to $433. I realize I am up $21k on one put and down $17k on the other put. I panic sell both and leave with $3k gains. Survival! I was stunned any dork bought my obviously dead put with minutes left.

So what happens? $TSLA crashes (of course) all the way to $426.50 at end of day. I was right.

[End of day: $TSLA at $426.5 after hitting $439 intraday](https://preview.redd.it/l2459uecknde1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=74e4ed83b0c3897783421e490ef372230d2d2177)

So let's do the math on those puts:  
$435 - $426.5 = $8.5 \* 150 \* 100 = $127,500  
$430 - $426.5 = $3.5 \* 200 \* 100 = $70,000

I would have cleared $197,500 instead of $3,200 because I was a paper handed bitch and didn't want to lose $47k. This is the worst $3k I've ever made. FML. ",TSLA,Tesla

Opening Scene of Ferris Bueller's Day Off:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuOHbyuanbY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuOHbyuanbY)

**Inauguration of Trump Monday**¬†is priced in, and it was priced very high in November (Expectations high). What is not priced in, is the exact outcome of the flood of Executive Orders waiting to signed on Monday. We have some hints of what they will be, but I don‚Äôt think anyone knows exactly what they will be and how they will be viewed from the market. I expect a wild ride, but I don't think the outcomes will match the predictions.

**My Speculation:**

**1. National Emergency**

Who the hell knows what it will be? Economic? Border crisis? Public health? Your guess is as good as mine. But there will be one, and the markets won‚Äôt like it. (There are¬†[several reports](https://www.beckersasc.com/supply-chain/trump-eyes-national-emergency-declaration-to-levy-tariffs.html)¬†on this already.) Plus Trump declared seven national emergencies last time, and another would give him sweeping powers to make significant executive order changes.¬†**Puts on SPX OTM.**

**2. Tariffs**

I‚Äôm taking the man at his word: tariffs are coming. The specifics‚Äîwhat and how much‚Äîremain unknown, but most economists agree this will be bad news. Tariffs also happen to feature in the intro to my favorite movie, so that‚Äôs good enough DD for me. Long¬†**puts on XLY**¬†and throwing in a little¬†**SOYB puts**¬†as well. (Thanks,¬†[Soy Boy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i37uof/spilling_the_beans_on_tariffs_the_untold_story_of/).)

**3. Bitcoin (IBIT)**

I know, I know. But hear me out‚ÄîTrump isn‚Äôt going to do anything to¬†*hurt*¬†BTC. At least not yet. There will at least be signaling of something positive (per many¬†[news sources](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-bitcoin-crypto-day-one-first-100-days-executive-orders-policies/)). Plus, if the S&P 500 goes down, BTC believers will flock to it as a safe haven. If the S&P 500 goes up, BTC holders will reinvest their stock gains to buy more BTC. (My wild speculation is that banking regulation of BTC will be loosened, and the sale of existing US gov BTC will be halted.) Either way, it seems like Bitcoin has an upward trajectory.¬†**Calls on IBIT.**

**4. Hedge**

If the markets tank, they‚Äôll tank hard and my deep OTM puts will pay big. However, there‚Äôs always a chance they‚Äôll go up. To cover my bases, I‚Äôm doing a straddle on SPX on a 1DTE. If I‚Äôm wrong and lose all my puts, the calls might help me break even. And if my puts hit, I won‚Äôt care about the call premium. (Neutral markets? Theta crushes me like a sad ant.) I am sure there is some math that says I am doing it wrong. I will pick up a¬†**call on SPX ATM**¬†towards the end of the day.

**Sidenote:**

I‚Äôm stuck holding¬†**puts on DJT**¬†until it plummets. My DJT calls already paid off, so whatever I get out of those puts is pure profit at this point. As a put on TSLA, because screw them.

I‚Äôve been slowly building these positions over time (which is a very stupid strategy), and it‚Äôs been a rough week. As a rainbow bear, I‚Äôve been getting punished while theta eats me alive. So here‚Äôs a little loss porn for your enjoyment as well to show current positions. If doesn't work out, I am doing ""no options February""...

Edit: Positions didn't come through. (My regards.)

2025-01-16,15:15:04,WallStreetBets,TSM Earnings: Is AVGO's 2024 Revenue Quadrupling to $90B? The Signs Point to YES!,"Broadcom (AVGO) is on the verge of an explosion, and it's all thanks to AI. Their recent earnings call wasn't just good; it was a game-changer. **And guess what? TSM's latest earnings call just confirmed everything!**

CEO Hock Tan predicts AVGO's AI chip market (XPUs and networking) could reach **$60 BILLION to $90 BILLION by 2027**! That's up from around $12 billion today. We're talking about a potential **4x increase or more** ‚Äì the same kind of growth that made Nvidia what it is today.

**Here's the key:**

* **TSM Confirms the Trend:**¬†TSM, the world's leading chip manufacturer and a key supplier for Broadcom, reported HUGE demand for AI chips in their recent earnings call 

>we now forecast the revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period starting off the already higher base of 2024. We expect AI accelerator to be the strongest driver of our HPC platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of our overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. 

* This is a major indicator that the AI chip boom is REAL and Broadcom is in the right place at the right time.
* **Hyperscaler Demand:**¬†Three major cloud companies (hyperscalers) are driving this growth, and Broadcom is working with two more.
* **Custom Chips are King:**¬†Google's Gemini uses Broadcom's custom chips (TPUs). This proves that specialized chips are essential for large-scale AI. Off-the-shelf just won't cut it.
* **VMware Integration:**¬†The VMware acquisition is successful and profitable.
* **Broadcom's Expertise:**¬†They're the best at designing and making these custom AI chips.

Broadcom is positioned to dominate the AI chip market, just like Nvidia. The growth won't be overnight, but the long-term potential is massive.

Here's the kicker: AVGO's revenue could potentially quadruple, yet the stock price is only up around 20% in the past month! **This means there's a HUGE gap between the potential future value and the current price.** AVGO is seriously undervalued right now.

**TL;DR:** AVGO is about to become a major player in the AI chip market. $60-90 billion in potential revenue by 2027 (possibly 4x growth or more), driven by custom chip demand from big cloud companies. TSM's earnings call confirms this is happening NOW. **The stock price hasn't caught up to the potential yet, meaning there's a lot of room to grow.** This could be the next NVDA.",NVDA,NVIDIA

You thought it would be because of crackheads and homeless people? Nope, those are the least of Serve Robotics' worries. 



The company has a history of not only being unprofitable, but also having negative gross margins. That's REALLY bad, the cost of operating their robots is higher than the revenue generated from them. It's the equivalent of buying high and selling low, I'm sure you regards are familiar with that.

This would be fine if the company focused on improving the robot's efficiency, autonomy and costs until they can demonstrate potential future profitability...

But instead, this year they suddenly decided to start manufacturing 2000 of their 3rd generation robot. That's a 20x increase from their current fleet of 100 robots. These robots cost more to produce than an average car, this sudden ramp up will put a lot of financial pressure on the company. The CEO's reasoning: this mass production contract will help drive the robot's cost down.



*By the way, did you know their robots are actually remote controlled with a PS5 controller 20% of the time?*

[From SERV's 10-K 2023 SEC filing](https://preview.redd.it/q3zaju5vb7de1.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1aac7002652983d323481aaf88297d549d30988)

Anyways, let's run the numbers down. Don't skip to the TLDR yet I'll try to make it interesting.

What we want to figure out is a future projection of:

* a robot's average yearly revenue
* its associated yearly costs as well as production costs
* calculate the years it takes to get a return on investment

Let's first take a look at their fleet's current revenue.

[From SERV's latest quarterly report](https://preview.redd.it/67fawqkec7de1.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=02b62e9a6900fd04f87a36d1891284e6161d91f0)

Extrapolated yearly, that's $450k in delivery revenue generated by the robots. But how many robots were active during that period?

https://preview.redd.it/hligx3cic7de1.png?width=559&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c085ee410181ab38760de0fc31c6f685e272444

The ""daily supply hours"" indicate a daily runtime of about 8h per robot. 

On average, 59 daily active robots. Extrapolating the quarterly data, that gives us an average yearly delivery revenue per robot of... **$7612**.



Does that sound bad? We haven't even looked at the cost of operating each of these robots, and just comparing that yearly revenue to the manufacturing cost of the robot makes you question how they could ever reach profitability. 



I dug into their [SEC filings](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1832483/000121390024018566/ea0200355ex10-16_serverobot.htm) and found out their current 2nd generation robots cost them **$63,654** each. It's very unsurprising the CEO never talks about that number in any of his numerous interviews. It would currently take a robot 8 years to gain enough delivery revenue to pay back its initial production cost.



We haven't even talked about the cost of revenue yet, Is it already all over for Serve robotics? No, remember, what we're interested in is a projection of their future profitability. 



According to the company, their 3rd gen delivery robots that will begin manufacturing will have more battery autonomy, higher top speeds (up to 11mph, looking forward to the inevitable accidents and lawsuits), and a production cost per robot slashed by half.



I booted up excel and ran the numbers. Considering the delivery revenue efficiency per robot hours barely went up between 2023 and 2024, I'm projecting a charitable improved daily robot runtime (currently at 8h) and delivery efficiency increase based on the new gen robot specs. Also accounting for the halved robot cost ($32,000):

[values are per robot](https://preview.redd.it/ckldrv0dd7de1.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=02a0c75367a05a732cf3623d50ffea942aa52f83)

Not looking great...

And I'm not done, lets get to the fun part! Expenses.



These are the expenses that directly scale with the number of robots:

* **Robot remote control and monitoring:**

As I've mentioned before, the robots need to be remote controlled 20% of the time to navigate ""complicated"" situations like intersection crossings. For a robot daily uptime of 10 hours, that's 2 hours of human work time. In reality, more than 2 hours would be necessary as the amount of robots needing human control at the same time will spike. Let's go with 2.5 hours as a conservative estimate. At a rate of 20$/hour, that's... $18,250 spent yearly per robot. 

* **Robot repairs and maintenance:**

Yearly robot repairs and maintenance typically amount to 10 to 20% of their initial cost. Considering SERV's robots operate outside, sometimes under rain and other bad conditions, their maintenance costs are probably higher but let's use the conservative estimate of 10%, so $3200 per year.



Those are the two biggest expenses, I'll ignore mobile internet costs (each robot livestreams video feed to human operators), the cost to physically help the robot when it gets toppled over, energy cost to repair batteries, etc.



Before we get to the final projection, it's important to take into account a secondary revenue source for their robots: advertisement revenue. Ads they stick on the sides and top of the robot. I chose an estimate of $800 a month per robot in ad revenue. For reference, full car wrap ad services typically pay at maximum $400/month.



And here we have the final projection:

[values are per robot](https://preview.redd.it/4gr0dcn7e7de1.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab2493adeaa67574b7f9950de2da425b3b5f31ce)

Even with the most charitable projection, 6 years to recoup the robot's production cost is way too long to be profitable. The robot's lifespan might not even exceed 5 years. The real cost of operating the robots will also very likely be much higher than my estimation.

# A bit of history

SERV is currently valued at over 1 billion dollars. When it IPOed, at the beginning of 2024, it was priced at a valuation of 100 Million, and its stock quickly dropped by half once it hit the market. Since then, it diluted its shares by more than 2x. 

So why did the stock massively pump 2000% in the middle of the year? That happened after the reveal of NVIDIA's $12M investment (at the time, 10% ownership) in the company. 

NVIDIA's venture capital arm ([Nventures](https://www.nventures.ai/)), invested in the company back in 2022. It invests in all sorts of innovative AI companies who use their products. NVIDIA has a vested interest in the company successfully operating autonomous delivery robots, it's great advertisement for their Jetson modules and the advancement of AI. That does not mean NVIDIA believes or really cares that much about the company being able to generate a profit.

# My prediction

The 2000 robots, all supposedly manufactured during 2025, will cost the company an initial 60 million dollars. As the robots begin operating, costs will balloon 20 times over and revenue won't catch up. Serve Robotics will continue bleeding money at a much faster pace, and will keep diluting shares. Insiders started selling a lot of shares in the past 2 months ($3M). I expect it might take a while for the price to correct itself, but considering how overvalued SERV is right now I'm confident in shorting it and I expect it to drop during future financial reports.

2025-01-14,19:57:27,WallStreetBets,NBIS - Picks & Shovels but make it AI,"TL:DR :

* Company makes infrastructure for AI workloads at extremely impressive efficiency levels. Proprietary configuration for GPU clusters (first in NA to complete in Q1), has efficiency levels and compute performance beyond that of Tesla's latest creation, which NVDA Jensen said described as remarkable. Tip of the iceberg
* $700 mil invested by NVIDIA, who is supplying H100 Hopper GPUs for their cluster models with the first being constructed in KC, with plans to integrate Blackwell GPU H2 2025.
* Minimal debt totaling $27mil with a near $2bil in cash, $1bil+ planned infrastructure development in 25', with ARR forecast of $750m-1b

Primary focus is not some unremarkable data processing system that every SV chump and his grandma are pushing down throats. Nebius was sitting on some already profitable infrastructure in Finland and decided they could expand, replicate and improve across Europe and North America.

They were able to secure listing on the NASDAQ, and quickly obtained a $700 mil investment from Nvidia. Contrary to the few posts from your normal run of the mill bullshit like Motley fool etc..., this part on it's own is actually meaningless. Companies the size on Nvidia throw hail mary's at startups all the time and don't blink when they fail. However, in the context of their lofty development goals, this was their entry point to securing the hardware they needed to succeed, of which there is a finite supply.

Nebius plans to house 35,000 GPU's upon completion of the KC facility (20,000 by year end), utilizing the latest and incredibly efficient NVIDIA H200 GPUs

Alongside this, their facility in Finland is getting an overhaul and expansion, and a new facility will be constructed in Paris.

This is early days, P/S incredibly low in the peer group, which is insane considering the ridiculous multiples on all of the other shit doing nothing in this space. Industry trends are a massive tail wind. If they stay true to growth projections it's only a matter of time before it balloons, and Q1 is an excellent test of their reliance and ability to meet targets.

2025-01-14,19:57:27,WallStreetBets,NBIS - Picks & Shovels but make it AI,"TL:DR :

* Company makes infrastructure for AI workloads at extremely impressive efficiency levels. Proprietary configuration for GPU clusters (first in NA to complete in Q1), has efficiency levels and compute performance beyond that of Tesla's latest creation, which NVDA Jensen said described as remarkable. Tip of the iceberg
* $700 mil invested by NVIDIA, who is supplying H100 Hopper GPUs for their cluster models with the first being constructed in KC, with plans to integrate Blackwell GPU H2 2025.
* Minimal debt totaling $27mil with a near $2bil in cash, $1bil+ planned infrastructure development in 25', with ARR forecast of $750m-1b

Primary focus is not some unremarkable data processing system that every SV chump and his grandma are pushing down throats. Nebius was sitting on some already profitable infrastructure in Finland and decided they could expand, replicate and improve across Europe and North America.

They were able to secure listing on the NASDAQ, and quickly obtained a $700 mil investment from Nvidia. Contrary to the few posts from your normal run of the mill bullshit like Motley fool etc..., this part on it's own is actually meaningless. Companies the size on Nvidia throw hail mary's at startups all the time and don't blink when they fail. However, in the context of their lofty development goals, this was their entry point to securing the hardware they needed to succeed, of which there is a finite supply.

Nebius plans to house 35,000 GPU's upon completion of the KC facility (20,000 by year end), utilizing the latest and incredibly efficient NVIDIA H200 GPUs

Alongside this, their facility in Finland is getting an overhaul and expansion, and a new facility will be constructed in Paris.

This is early days, P/S incredibly low in the peer group, which is insane considering the ridiculous multiples on all of the other shit doing nothing in this space. Industry trends are a massive tail wind. If they stay true to growth projections it's only a matter of time before it balloons, and Q1 is an excellent test of their reliance and ability to meet targets.

2025-01-14,17:26:50,WallStreetBets,NTDOY as NVDA play,"Hear me out. Nintendo's new console, likely to be called the Nintendo Switch 2 to my great disappointment, is looking more and more likely to be announced this week.

We know for an absolute fact that the new system will use NVIDIA Tegra T239 for moar power.

""This chip focuses on improved ray tracing cores, faster memory and AI performance. With an Ampere chip and a reported 12GB of RAM, the Switch 2 could employ Nintendo‚Äôs take on DLSS or Nvidia‚Äôs upscaling technology.""

So my question for discussion is: Is this all priced into NTDOY and NVDA stock?

2025-01-14,15:47:41,WallStreetBets,New research note from Damo: Up to 100% bullish on Tesla to $800!,"Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target on Tesla from $400 to $430 (8.93% bullish vs. current price) and set a new bullish scenario valuation of $800 (100% bullish vs. current price). The stock index increase was primarily driven by Tesla's progress in self-driving car (AV) technology and its integration of embedded AI. ,

The report notes that Tesla's unique combination of expertise in data collection, robotics, energy storage, and AI/computing infrastructure puts it at the forefront of the emerging self-driving mobility market.

The analysts emphasize the role of Tesla's Travel Services division, the company's self-driving carpooling business, which is valued at $90 per share in a revised sum-of-the-parts valuation (SOTP) model. The travel services fleet size is expected to grow to 7.5 million vehicles by 2040, with projected revenue per mile of $1.46 and EBITDA margins of 29%„ÄÇ

  
Morgan Stanley also emphasized the growing importance of Tesla's Network Services, which covers recurring revenue streams such as Fully Self-Driving (FSD), Supercharging, and software upgrades.

The network services division is expected to contribute about one-third of Tesla's total EBITDA by 2030, with that percentage rising to nearly 60% by 2040. The Network Services division is currently valued at $168 per share, reflecting its growing importance in Tesla's business model.

We are raising our price target to $430 from the previous $400, an adjustment driven by increased valuation of travel services and network services, partially offset by lower valuation of the third-party battery business,‚Äù the analysts wrote.

They note that Tesla has a lot of potential in embedded AI, including opportunities in aerospace, marine, and other areas, though these have not yet been factored into this valuation.



Analysts expect Tesla's fleet of unmanned self-driving cars to debut in urban environments by 2026. However, in their Tesla Travel Services forecast, self-driving cars are not expected to achieve mass deployment until after 2030.

While self-driving policy may be reassessed at the national level once a new administration takes office, the analysts added that Tesla still faces 'significant hurdles' in overcoming the technical, testing and licensing challenges associated with near-term commercialization.

The updated bullish scenario of $800 per share assumes a fleet size of 12 million vehicles by 2040, revenues of $1.50 per mile, and EBITDA margins of 45%. This scenario foresees strong international expansion and greater pricing power.

On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's bearish scenario is valued at $200 per share (49% bearish compared to the current price), reflecting potential headwinds such as stricter regulation and slow market expansion.

Watching the history of the VIX we are currently at the beginning of a cyclical and with the turn of events lately, we are set for a real turn in the market by the beginning to end of next week. Short Term ETF VIXY 50MA is about to test the 200MA. Tesla vehicles being recalled and EV sales down down. BoFA no longer sees rate cuts coming in the upcoming years. Blackrock is almost down 10% so far. Yields are up. California is on fire, and in big trouble with the 2nd biggest city economy in the world threatened to be burned down. The busiest freeway in the world is shutting down due to these fires happening and on the lowend earlier today, the costs were estimated to be 20+ billion USD. If the fire does not stop by the end of this weekend the costs could effectively cost California over $1.5 Trillion. Power will be shutoff temporarily for the surrounding areas around LA causing for concerns for public safety. Bankruptcies are definitely expected to increase and while the politics and worldwide conflicts take over the media this upcoming week, LA is at risk of going up in smoke. 

All this being said, it is already the most devastating fire in US history and people will lose their home over a force of nature. As of the time of this post, only 8% has been contained so far.

2025-01-11,00:04:52,WallStreetBets,Here's the play boys,"DJT cooled off but still needs to move to test levels it set before the outcome of the elec. was ever known. I dont consider it a regular industry member but the tiktok lawsuit seems to be rallying social media stocks, creating the perfect condition for DJT. Looking forward to Jan 20th with DJT at the bottom of the 1yr MACD, it seems it has to move to test previous critical highs, whether it can set them or not, that leaves some upward movement here.

SMH and the leveraged daily SOXL (which has really taken a hit) also set relative highs on Tuesday and there should be some big movement coming up but it's already been waiting awhile - when could it come? Jan 20th could prove a catalyst for the market as a whole, who knows, but this index seems to be curving back up with plenty of room to move on the 5yr MACD, it just can't shake the 1yr MACD trend line to get any real price action going. NVDA set a all time high and AVGO had some great recent movement that doesn't seem to be considered in the index.

NVDA pulled off hard after setting an all time high on Tuesday. Its riding down the 5 yr MACD essentially going through a sell off, it just reached up to set a all time high during a sell off, so gotta buy that.

SMCI and INTC are both trading below the actual values of the companies but I can't recommend them. Definitely wouldnt buy options, especially on INTC. Holding a little SMCI shares because it's a profitable company, it spiked hard in the past and I made some good money on those options last year. I feel, it has to go back up eventually or at least test those levels.

2025-01-10,21:30:06,WallStreetBets,interesting Forbes article: What Nvidia‚Äôs CEO Missed About Quantum Computing,"Just found this Forbes article by Jason Snyder about the tangible value quantum computing is already delivering today. I thought so. The whole downwards hysteria is grossly exaggerated. AI will flourish to the maximum with the help of quantum computing which already is in massive use by many (big) companies.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonsnyder/2025/01/09/quantum-is-decades-away-not-so-fast/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonsnyder/2025/01/09/quantum-is-decades-away-not-so-fast/)

Here is an excerpt: 

""Quantum computing is not 30 years away‚Äîit‚Äôs already transforming industries by solving problems classical systems can‚Äôt. The technology is advancing rapidly. Hybrid quantum-classical systems are bridging the gap, delivering tangible results while paving the way for broader adoption.

The Real Game Changer: Quantum + AI

While quantum computing excels at optimization, pairing it with artificial intelligence unlocks even more potential. AI is adept at pattern recognition and predictive modeling but struggles with computational bottlenecks when dealing with massive datasets. Quantum computing eliminates these barriers, accelerating AI‚Äôs capabilities.

Quantum-enhanced AI can:

* Train faster by processing large datasets in parallel.
* Make predictions with greater precision by evaluating all potential outcomes simultaneously.
* Solve previously intractable problems, such as hyper-personalizing real-time customer experiences.

For businesses, this means AI models trained on quantum-optimized data can uncover insights that drive more accurate, impactful decision-making. 

**Experiment with Quantum Platforms**: Cloud-based tools like D-Wave‚Äôs Leap or IBM‚Äôs Qiskit make it easy to test quantum algorithms without significant investments.""

We've seen a few trends over the last few months where some previously-beat-up tickers went from trash to gold. I'm gonna call this trend ""shit we thought we'd have in the future because we watched a lot of sci-fi movies"". 2024 was the year of AI, then it was the space stocks (RKLB, LUNR, etc). Then it was the flying car stocks (ARCH, JOBY, etc). Then we all saw the quantum stock bubble (though any regard with a CS degree could have told you the same thing that Jensen did). So, what sci-fi future shit is left to invest in? Robots, obviously!

Except, robots, like space rockets, are real. And they're already in market and getting better rapidly. 2025 is the year when they'll really start to go mainstream, largely because software is the biggest limiting factor to how good robots are today. With recent advancements in AI, robots are going to start getting \*A LOT\* better.

Further supporting my bullish thesis is NVIDIA's recent release of their Cosmos Wold Foundation Model  (https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-cosmos-world-foundation-model-platform-to-accelerate-physical-ai-development). Why is this a big deal? because, this will really lower the cost of entry for the robot manufacturers as they won't have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to train a vision model by themselves. Now they can just equip their bots with some commodity sensors & cameras and build out the hardware bot for their use case.

2025-01-08,18:14:14,WallStreetBets,Buying the RGTI Dip? Stop. Think. ,"People hyping up the dip on RGTI seem to be ignoring the elephant in the room: a single, casual comment about quantum computing from a tech CEO wiped out 50% of RGTI's share price overnight. Let that sink in for a second... half the market cap gone, not because of earnings, not because of product failures, but because of words.

Now ask yourself: what does that say about what was propping up the $18+ price? Spoiler: It wasn‚Äôt the underlying financials or fundamentals.

So why are you buying back in? Are you seriously betting that Jensen walks back his comment? Or are you hoping another big-name CEO decides to contradict him just to boost this stock? Because that's a pretty wild gamble when you think about it.

This isn‚Äôt about a calculated investment anymore... it‚Äôs about FOMO and denial. Some of you don‚Äôt seem to want your money. Just remember, markets can stay irrational a lot longer than your wallet can.

TL;DR: Be real with yourself before buying the RGTI dip. Is this a strategic play, or are you just coping?

Edit#1 for clarification:

Clearly a divisive topic. Appreciate you all engaging and thanks for the award.

I‚Äôm seeing a lot of replies suggesting I‚Äôm bearish on quantum‚Äôs long-term potential. For clarity, I‚Äôm not. My point is that even at this dip, RGTI‚Äôs price doesn‚Äôt reflect its fundamentals or actual progress. If you believe in RGTI‚Äôs future, that‚Äôs fine... but why not wait for a price that matches its current reality?

If your plan is to time and profit off a dead cat bounce, great. Just be clear on your strategy.

Edit#2 for context some are missing:

I agree with this statement but not entirely. I think quantum computing is closer than we think. Personally I think Jensen Huang is saying this out of fear. NVIDIA will become obsolete once quantum computing truly hits the market. The power of quantum computing is incomparable compared to GPU‚Äôs. 

I think this dip is a great opportunity to buy going into the future.

The issue with GPU‚Äôs is the amount of energy they need to work. Which is why people are drawn to companies like OKLO or SMR to solve this energy issue. But quantum computing will be super efficient reducing the massive need for all this energy.

But yes there is still an energy problem regardless. The grid is growing day by day as people switch to more sustainable methods, EV‚Äôs etc.

Sorry the format sucks lol.

As you can see, the Oligarch Index has currently outperformed the S&P 500 by 30% since the election. Some of the companies like Ford which would benefit from protectionism haven't even shot up yet. Plenty of room for growth!¬† 

I really dgaf about how you feel about politics, if you don‚Äôt want to make money, that‚Äôs on you babe. Remember it‚Äôs not corruption if it‚Äôs legal!¬†Tariff exemptions aren‚Äôt cheap! 

Of course as always some of the bribes‚ÄîI mean donations‚Äîare by individuals who invest above our normie level like Sam Altman or Citadel hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, Timothy Mellon (yes the old school oligarch Mellon! I told you they‚Äôre making a come back!), Florida Crystals, or Pratt Industries if you don‚Äôt like that, well, try to stop corrupt people from becoming president! In the mean time, profit as much as you can! If you think I missed any, put it in the comments!

How is this company still afloat? The writing is on the wall.  You're betting on the stock and your betting again that this company won't pull shenanigans again. SMCI has a darkside but they're also successful and crafty. How long does this run last?  I think NVDA ultimately dumps them, maybe not suddenly, as they need to protect themselves, but there are better options. This stock ran up was incredible last year, almost too much, that was the first red flag in my opinion.

2025-01-06,21:33:24,WallStreetBets,The current U.S. stock market valuation has reached 2000 and 2021 levels.  Will this time be different?,"Three different U.S. stock market valuation models (the Buffett Indicator, CAPE ratio, and Mean Reversion Model - three different ways of objectively looking at the overall valuation of the current market) are flashing extreme overvaluation warning signs that were both last seen in 2000 and 2021.  Both 2000 and 2021 marked market euphoria highs, and bear markets followed.  You can make all your jokes that you want about gay bears successfully calling 420 of the last 69 recessions or what not, but the undeniable fact is that the track record of these three valuation models showing ""strongly overvalued"" in unison is 2 for 2 in ""calling"" bear markets that followed very quickly.  Will history repeat itself again?  Or is this time different (i.e. - valuations continue to ""not matter"" for longer)?

There is also a fourth model - the Interest Rate Model, which measures S&P 500 valuation relative to current 10-year treasury rate.  It hasn't quite hit the ""strongly overvalued"" line (it didn't in 2021 either), but it is pretty close to it.

There is also the Fed Funds Rate. It is showing a similar setup to previous cycles of rate hikes, followed by rate holds, followed by rate cuts, followed by recession.  The current setup looks similar to 2007-2008 especially.  Will the recession or bear market be cancelled this time with ""mission accomplished - soft landing achieved""?

Here is the inflation-adjusted S&P 500 on a log scale chart.  It has historically gone through a series of ""hot"" periods where the market beats inflation for roughly 15 years (give or take a few years), followed by ""cold"" periods where the market loses to inflation that last 10 years (give or take a few years).  The magnitude and time length of the current ""hot"" period looks like it could be giving way to a ""cold"" period soon if the overall historical cycle is followed.

Last but not least, I'll list a few informal ""Can't you just feel it it in the room?"" type ""blow-off top"" indicators of a potential market top:

1. Tesla stock doubled in price in like 1-2 months on shallow narratives not backed by numbers.  An insane $750 billion market cap to an even more insane $1.5 trillion market cap in 1-2 months on a company earning roughly $13 billion annually (132 P/E ratio right now) and not growing much anymore.  Ludicrous.  Earnings have not exploded in line with stock price, not nearly at all.  I don't care what you TSLA lovers say - your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth.
2. Palantir stock also doubled in price in like 1-2 months, also on shallow narratives not backed by numbers.  Roughly $100 billion to $180 billion market cap with a price-to-SALES ratio going from an insane 30x to an even more insane 67x.  Ludicrous.  And I don't care what you PLTR lovers say - your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth.
3. *\[Removing this point from discussion because AutoMod thought I was breaking rule #8, even though I wasn't.  I pasted it down in the comments section* [*HERE*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hv91vx/comment/m5ssco9/)*.\]*
4. Just the mentality of too many market participants buying ponzi-scheme like assets or money-burning trash companies at all in general, often knowingly.  Like, seriously, why is this even a thing?  What the fuck is wrong with this market?  This shouldn't be happening... like, at all.
5. The great momentum chase of 2024. The theme of the year was to just bid up and crowd into the most popular meme-like line-go-up assets, regardless of fundamentals.  It went into over-drive in November/December, to the point of self-parody.  It has a very end-stage bull market feeling to it.
6. The great AI hype.  Does the potential future of AI justify many of these extreme valuations?  Maybe, but I'm not convinced that there's much upside left near-term.  The only companies making serious money from this so far are Nvidia and the handful of companies selling the AI hardware to other companies that are speculating on it.  And the once rapid progression in generative AI chatbots, picture generators, and video generators seen in 2023 and early 2024 seems to have slowed and hit a bit of a wall in the second half of 2024.

TL;DR - All the warning signs of extreme overvaluation and an incoming bear market are there.  Unlike most other gay bear posts that usually just show one ""warning sign"" chart to make a case, I showed you multiple charts, along with multiple observations.  Whether you choose to ignore them or not depends on how long you think the market will choose to ignore them or not.

2025-01-06,19:04:36,WallStreetBets,$BBAI- Is It Worth A Shot? ,"Hey everyone,

I am writing this to make sure you don't let this one fly under the radar. Source:¬†[The High-Potential AI Stock Making Waves Now with Key Deals](https://thebigcapitalist.com/the-high-potential-ai-stock-making-waves-now-with-key-deals/), and after looking into it, I feel like it could be a great opportunity for anyone interested in AI.

[BigBear.ai](http://BigBear.ai) (NYSE: BBAI)

Maybe it‚Äôs not one of those flashy names like Nvidia or Palantir, but there‚Äôs a lot happening here that makes it worth a closer look.

Here‚Äôs why I think BBAI is worth a shot:

**1. Partnering with Palantir**

They‚Äôve teamed up with Palantir, which is a HUGE deal. Palantir is one of the top dogs in data analytics and AI, so this partnership could seriously boost BigBear‚Äôs capabilities. It also opens doors for more government contracts, which are a major source of revenue. Being a smaller company and getting to work with someone like Palantir is huge.

**2. Acquisition of Pangiam**

BigBear recently acquired a company called Pangiam that specializes in facial recognition and biometric tech. This move strengthens their position in security solutions, especially in areas like airport and border security. With the demand for AI-driven security growing, this could lead to some big opportunities down the road.

**3. Massive Government Contracts**

They‚Äôve already locked in a potential $900 million government contract. That‚Äôs not just a lot of money‚Äîit‚Äôs a massive vote of confidence in their tech. Government contracts are stable, long-term, and show that BigBear is a serious player in the space.

**4. Recent performance**

Latley the stock grew by about 200 presents in the last quarter. and yes it is not the safest option, but this move definitely shows interest by investors.  
Also looking at the analyst rating, gives me more confidence about it.

**5. Insider Ownership**  
Nearly 28 precent of the company is owned by insiders, which is a positive sign. It shows that the leadership team has confidence in the business and is invested in its success. Insider ownership often aligns management's interests with shareholders, which can be reassuring for potential investors.

**Why I Think It‚Äôs Worth a Shot**

Yes, BigBear is still unprofitable, but they‚Äôre in a high-growth phase, and that‚Äôs normal for a company investing heavily in its future. The Palantir partnership, the Pangiam acquisition, and those government contracts all point to a company that‚Äôs building a strong foundation.

It feels like one of those plays where, if you get in early and they deliver, the upside could be huge. Of course, there‚Äôs risk (like with any small-cap stock), but I‚Äôm leaning toward it being worth it.

2025-01-06,12:55:55,WallStreetBets,"""New"" Volkswagen Leaks ","Alright degenerates, strap in because this is why Volkswagen might just be the juiciest short of 2025. Spoiler alert: this makes Dieselgate look like a warmup.

My Position: Just opened a -0,4 Delta 80‚Ç¨ put on Volkswagen (Vz.) for 5000 ‚Ç¨ expiring 19th June 26.

The Chaos Computer Club just (27.12.24) just revealed that Volkswagen (and its subsidiaries Audi, Seat, Skoda) exposed the real-time locations of *800,000 EVs*. That's right ‚Äì anyone with basic skills could pinpoint where your $40k EV is parked, plus grab your name and contact info. VW literally left their cars and customers wide open for anyone to exploit. Volkswagen‚Äôs software arm, Cariad, stored all this sensitive data on Amazon Web Services without proper encryption or safeguards. Let me say that again: **no encryption in 2025.** That's amateur hour for a company that sells millions of cars. Oh, and this isn‚Äôt the first time VW screwed the pooch on tech; their software track record is *garbage.*

*Here is the link to their video:* [*https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-wir-wissen-wo-dein-auto-steht-volksdaten-von-volkswagen#l=eng&t=0*](https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-wir-wissen-wo-dein-auto-steht-volksdaten-von-volkswagen#l=eng&t=0)

**Why This Is Bigger Than Dieselgate**  
Dieselgate cost Volkswagen over $30 billion in fines, lawsuits, and buybacks. But that was *emissions*. This? This is **personal data** ‚Äì names, locations, potential stalking targets and members of the BND. We‚Äôre living in the post-GDPR era, where the EU doesn‚Äôt play nice with data breaches. Fines for mishandling data can be as high as 4% of annual global turnover, which for VW could mean billions. Plus, the reputational damage.

**There has not yet been a Market reaction to the release of this video.**

Also want to give you some reasons why you should not take my advice and short VW:

* Volkswagen is the biggest EV player in Europe with about 25% market share. European people don‚Äôt trust Chinese vehicles, and they don‚Äôt trust Elon Musk.
* VW is grossly undervalued compared to Tesla. We‚Äôre talking ‚Ç¨44 billion market cap vs. ‚Ç¨1,279 billion for Tesla. VW currently earns those ‚Ç¨44 billion every four years.
* CCC did responsible disclosure, and VW already fixed the breach. It will be hard to prove harm done to you.
* The German state is highly invested in VW
* EU regulations require automakers to collect and process vast amounts of data to comply with emissions standards, safety protocols, and EV monitoring. The breach highlights shortcomings, but some responsibility lies with the regulatory framework.

Keeping with the theme of ""25"" (and because I am too poor to put $100 in each stock) I am considering putting $25 in each stock tomorrow morning and holding for one year and posting results the first week of 2026.

¬†**Q3 2024 Highlights**¬†

* Revenue of $6.8 billion. 18% increase YoY.
* Gross profit of $3.4 billion. 24% increase YoY.
* Operating income of $724 million. 223% increase YoY.

¬†**Q3 2024 By Segment**

Data Center -¬†

Net revenue of $3.5 billion. 122% increase YoY.

Operating income of $1.04 billion. 240% increase YoY.

Client -

Net revenue of $1.88 billion. 29% increase YoY.

Operating income of $276 million. 97% increase YoY.

Gaming -¬†

Net revenue of $462 million. 69% decrease YoY.

Operating income of $12 million. 94% decrease YoY.¬†

Embedded -¬†

Net revenue of $927 million. 25% decrease YoY.

Operating income of $372 million. 39% decrease YoY.

**Data Center Growth**¬†\- This is AMD‚Äôs fastest growing segment and accounts for roughly 50% of all revenue. This number is going to continue its rapid rise due to key acquisitions and product innovation. Lisa Su estimates the market for data center AI accelerators to grow at a CAGR of 60% until the year 2028. That would value the market at $500 billion for things like CPUs, GPU‚Äôs, FPGA‚Äôs, and ASIC‚Äôs. Obviously, Nvidia currently dominates the market. Despite this, there is room for multiple players and AMD has shown their ability to capture market share. In 2022, they surpassed Intel in both market value and annual revenue, positioning themselves as the clear number two player in the market. I've said it before with companies like Palantir, data is the future and every company needs it. Well in order for a company to have data, you need chips. Everything needs chips. We are still in a small and juvenile market that has massive amounts of room to grow.

**Acquisition of ZT Systems** \- Announced in August 2024, AMD will acquire ZT Systems for $4.9 billion. The deal is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2025. ZT specializes in designing and deploying data center AI computing and storage solutions. This shows the focus and commitment AMD has to their fastest growing segment.¬†

**Strong Belief in Lisa Su -** Lisa Su is an amazing CEO with a strong desire for excellency. After becoming CEO in 2014, she has completely turned around the company and continues to improve it.¬†Here is a great video to watch of her - [https://youtu.be/8Ve5SAFPYZ8](https://youtu.be/8Ve5SAFPYZ8)

**Conclusion** \- AMD is gaining significant amounts of market share for data centers, a trend that will continue as the market grows. Despite declines in the gaming and embedded segments, the company overall continues to grow revenues. The decline in gaming looks alarming but it makes sense. New gen consoles came out 4 years ago which AMD supplies chips for. Regardless, what I‚Äôm focused on here is the data center growth. AMD is innovative and managed extremely well which can be seen by continuously improving operating margins and FCF. This company will continue to become a monster.¬†At a current price of **$125,** I expect this to easily get back to **$200+** in 2025 giving a solid 60% upside.",NVDA,NVIDIA
2025-01-05,03:51:43,WallStreetBets,Lost 18000 in 2 months,"Edit: people seem to be misunderstanding my post I mainly intend to do paper trading until I can get my skills to be a bit better. The goal is just to understand the market more.

Well to tell my tale I should start by saying I have been investing for a while. Started with penny stocks with 2k, dwindled it 0. And then put it in long term in 2022 and made a shit ton on nvda, meta and few other stocks. 

At some point I started observing NVDA closely and also got indocrtianted to options. So during the earnings in May/June 2023, I put 7k into NVDA on an OTM contract, made shit ton. And then lost a shit ton on other earning plays and made everything and a bit more on AVGO a month later, making my net worth 48k. 

48k is pre crazy, and I made some dumb trades and eventually got that close to 0. And to get everything back quickly I pumped 6k more, and pretty soon lost it all. While I am working and this is my savings this doesn't in anyway affect my daily life. But it hurts my ego quite a bit. 

I wanted to do more revenge trading, but losing 18k puts things into perspective, so I decided maybe not doing what I am doing is probably something to consider.

Since September I have been just looking at charts and reading patterns, and I have basically gotten good at reading NVDA to a certain extent. And over the last month (since early dec) I invested another $1000 and I am on a goal to make it to $18,000. Which I have done well with and its close to $2500. 

But I realize I need to be able to understand and learn a bit more about the market to scale this, and have a better idea on when to do what.

So I am coming with a plan for myself to kind of understand the basics, so far what I have in the pipeline to look into:

1. What really is a stock, what dictates its movement?
2. Understand what the many stats you see in we bull/fin viz and etc about a stock and how they affect a stock. (Not sure how to correlate them, but that's part of the challenge)
3. Look into observable and recurring patterns I can take advantage of:
   1. Trying to make a quick buck out of IV dropping post earnings.
   2. See indicators of what make the market move up.
   3. Predicting if strong stocks can move the entire industry and if there are affiliates that move along side it to take advantage of unrealized gain from them.
   4. Understanding Options better, calls, puts, and selling them. And how the greeks affect them.

This is just me spitballing, but if anyone who has been successful with short term trading in the long term wants to give me tips, or any changes to what I have above or have resources to offer, I would very much appreciate it.

Now along side this I am a computer science grad so this is something of a side project to me, I am looking to see if I can build an app for myself mainly to see if I can emulate a time for any stock from months ago and let the stock move in real time but from a time you set into the past.

For example set NVDA to Jan 2nd 2025 at 9AM and watch it move second by second for practice with pattern analysis when doing weekly. Alongside that possible scrapping to see data from months ago and seeing if I can create something of a algo to predict stock movements from months as if it hasn't yet happened. 

Most of  the ideas are very unrefined but this is my honest effort to do better than the gambling I lost in. Any advice is appreciated.",NVDA,NVIDIA

","What is KULR's core business model exactly? Providing battery thermal safety solutions, licensing fan AI software that helps suppress vibrations? Selling safe cases for batteries? Or maybe it's the recently announced BTC treasury? Wrong! None of the above. KULR's money making strategy... is to milk YOU! The unsuspecting, highly regarded ""investor"".

And what makes me say that, you ask? Many hours of research spent on New Year that I will detail in this post (yes, I had nothing better to do).

Let's begin by introducing Michael Mo, the CEO and founder of KULR. He did a¬†[reddit AmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/o6iboh/i_am_michael_mo_ceo_of_kulr_technology_our/)¬†right after KULR was listed on the NYSE in 2021, what a nice fellow.  
And right there marks the beginning of a deceitful strategy:

*Heavily embellish accomplishments*,¬†*announce big name ""partners"" or ""collaborators"", whilst obfuscating what the relationship is really about, or what the accomplishment actually is.*

https://preview.redd.it/yxqbg56n8mae1.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=f906d5b6cb11703fc7db1d3ad99cef09516e738f

Surely he has a lot to say and can explain their partnership with Andretti Autosports? Well, no not really:

https://preview.redd.it/us679crs8mae1.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=035443f54cac579a2cc6b0a70e1a15392b4d3e06

What an insightful answer by our CEO Michael Mo!

According¬†[to Andretti](https://andrettiglobal.com/news/2022/10/kulr-technology-group-returns-to-andretti-autosport-for-indianapolis-500-with-marco-andretti/), KULR was their primary sponsor for their INDYCAR program. Even after thorough research, nothing seems to indicate KULR was at any point developing or providing their technology to or in collaboration with Andretti.

Surely Mr. Mo wouldn't lie about that, while KULR was actually just sponsoring Andretti in a marketing deal??

I quickly realized, as I deep dived on KULR's announced accomplishments, partnerships and collaborations, that my research painted a much different story every single time.

https://preview.redd.it/e3wvlunw8mae1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7f34ddbf4a7e8ed7239620962e9afd3cfb62b47

What an impressive list of big name ""Customers"" and ""Partners"" listed in the latest investor presentation! Makes you wonder how they only barely hit 10 Million annual revenue with so many ""Key Clients"". Of course, Mr. Mo never actually goes into detail about who the clients are and what is being sold to them.

Fortunately, I have a lot of time on my hands so let's go into some of those supposed customers and partners.

For many of these companies, I could not find a SINGLE source of information linking them to KULR in any way.

**NASA**

KULR sure do like to mention NASA a lot when talking about their biggest accomplishments. Let's dive into those.

https://preview.redd.it/ip5ioic49mae1.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3d6e5c24aff8ad1d17521f22ca3b4dd967b7b68

In 2019, Leidos was awarded a contract by NASA to help bring supplies to the ISS. Leidos decided to use KULR's technology to... \*drumrolls\* safely store laptop batteries next to each other. KULR storage bags that ensure one of them overheating doesn't overheat the ones next to it.

What else?

In 2020, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, funded by NASA, was in charge of SHERLOC, an analysis instrument, for the upcoming Mars rover mission. The laboratory chose KULR's heatsinks to ensure the lasers and sensors wouldn't overheat. Unfortunately, the SHERLOC instrument ran into technical issues when the rover was deployed on Mars.

In July 2024, KULR landed a battery safety contract for $400k worth up to $2 Million with NASA, for automated battery cell testing. Not bad, but not very noteworthy either when you look at KULR's current $1 Billion market cap.

**SpaceX**

Name dropping SpaceX as a ""partner"" is a straight up lie.

KULR will, for the first time ever, in **2026**, have their battery in space on a nanosatellite. It will launch via a deal with ""Exo-launch"", on a SpaceX Rideshare mission (a low cost launching service that allows shared cost for multiple satellites/customers).

KULR is a CUSTOMER of SpaceX. It seems Mr. Mo has a habit of confusing, ""being a customer of"", and ""being partners with"", a company. Am I a partner of Wendy's when I buy chicken tendies? no.

Mr. Mo does it again with Molicel, which is also listed as a ""customer or partner"", when all they do is supply KULR with battery cells.

**So does KULR have any actual customers??**

Well, yes. A few that are hard to identify. One of them is Viridi Parente. Viridi signed a multi-million, three year contract in 2021 with KULR for their battery thermal safety tech in the development of a stationary energy storage system. Even though KULR communicate a lot to their investors, it's unclear if this partnership with Viridi will be ongoing and grow in the future.

Remember when I mentioned fan AI tech? KULR have been wanting in on the AI and NVIDIA hypetrain this year, so they've been developing an AI using NVIDIA's jetson, to help reduce fan vibrations, and capitalize on the growing amount of AI data centers that use fans. What does it have to do with battery thermal safety tech? Absolutely nothing, but it sure helps drive the stock price up, especially after announcing their sole licensing deal with a mysterious Japanese customer for $1 Million.

Sure makes you wonder, if KULR had a patented top of the line space-ready battery safety technology that could be mass-produced, why would they dedicate resources to developing a completely different technology, when they have a grand total of 57 employees and 2 open positions.

**Then how does KULR make money and stay afloat?**

That's where Mr. Mo hopes you and I come in! Since KULR has never been profitable, and will remain that way for the foreseeable future as they are no where near any sort of mass commercialization for any product, KULR relies on ATM offerings to generate cash, diluting shareholders in the process. The higher the stock price, the more cash they can get from the offerings.

Did I mention Mr. Mo suddenly had this great idea for KULR to become a BTC treasury? What an amazing excuse to dilute shareholders even more while the stock is massively overvalued, despite them not needing any more cash!

[KULR outstanding shares](https://preview.redd.it/gbg8hcq89mae1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=44d669ecd722e4c0850aa3dcf248e008b08b5834)

**Conclusion, TLDR:**

KULR is massively overvalued, whilst having no plan or guidance for any sort of significant revenue increase that would justify a $1 Billion valuation. Instead of focusing on one product/technology, KULR diversifies itself to try and grab as much market attention to drive its stock price up and dilute shareholders. KULR CEO makes up fake ""partnerships"" with big name companies, deceiving investors.

2025-01-01,18:11:17,WallStreetBets,Gains are not worth the risk,"I wrote this in the hopes of saving some of you future heartache and irreversible trauma. I lost 110k over the past month. The majority after options calls during the bloodbath after december fed meeting. 
 
If i could go back to my past self, i would say this. The loss isn't worth the potential gains. Before, I was just burnt out from my job. But at least i was proud to have saved up my first 100k. Now im burnt out, down 3 years of savings, and have a lot less freedom in my life.  I can't focus on work, i'm depressed and can't find joy in my hobbies anymore. I'm probably in the process of ruining my relationship as well. Even if i had won, i definitely don't think I'd be happier an equivalent amount. 

Life is hard. If you worked hard and earned some money. Dont make degenerate bets. The vast majority of us are just normal humans who should just save their time and invest in part index fund and part cash equivalents.

Or maybe this marks the bottom and it is a buying opportunity. Your choice. 

EDIT
Was only expecting maybe max 100 upvotes but i guess I said something that resonates. 

After wading through the comments, insults, memes, etc. I was touched by enough kind people reaching out to add some more. I dont think i can stomach another comment reading though so please dont expect me to react anymore. Notifications are off. Posted a 80k loss screenshot of part of my portfolio. Another 30k was lost in another account. https://imgur.com/a/jMvs9DR

1. ""only bet what you can afford to lose"" doesn‚Äôt really make sense. Dont use that saying to convince yourself to make risky gambles. I could afford to lose 110k in the sense that i won't starve, i would still have a roof over my head, and i still have 30k i left that i promised to myself i wouldnt touch. But i lost things i didn't expect. Like my passions for my hobbies, a healthy exercise habit, my mental health after recovering from depression during college. Even during the time i was trading, i also hated how it felt. I was glued to the ticker and was losing connection with real life relationships.  Before you use the money you think you are willing to lose. Try spending a part of that amount on yourself. Get yourself some luxuries, some experiences, maybe travel, take a sabbatical from work, or spend it on someone close to you.  Its all numbers on the screen when trading, so its easy to lose a sense of it all. Afterwards, imagine losing the ability to do all that and only proceed if youre ok with that. 

2. For those who think this isnt something a normal person could go through. I saved roughly 60-70% of my paycheck the past 3 years. I made sacrifices on lifestyle and luxuries. 

3. For those that still want to go on, i sure cant stop you. Maybe some of us need to learn a lesson firsthand. Might be better even to learn early on before you have a family with hundreds of thousands saved up over decades. This might help. 

Looking back, i definitely had chances to make money.  I was thinking about RKLB when it was $5 (now $25). I had a chance to jump into RDDT when it was still $80. I considered googl at 165 since the bad news seemed overblown.   Even at my most insane already down 50k, before i lost it all i almost went all in in on christmas eve with 1 week dte options on tsla calls.  Instead i did it on the Friday afterwards hoping for a similar bounce to recover the from the drop after fed earnings.  If you get into single stocks, crypto, options it's a lot riskier. Youre going to have to be lucky with the timing. Youre also going to have to be disciplined with your strategy.  

When you make your bet. If you win, stop.  i hope you become happy. I hope you get more time to pursue your passions. To spend time with family and friends. To become a person you are proud of. 

If you lose, i hope you recover. Never gamble again. Life will be harder. But, maybe we can still find a part of that happiness. I dont think we really want money. We just want a more human experience. ",TSLA,Tesla

2024-12-27,23:21:44,WallStreetBets,$GSAT: The Overlooked Satellite Company With Extraterrestrial Potential,"**TLDR: Globalstar‚Äôs outsized role in Low-Earth Orbit communications and recent equity partnership with Apple will provide substantial future cash flows and support rapid growth. Price target is $5, but will very likely extend far above this valuation.**  


Globalstar ($GSAT) provides Mobile Satellite Services through its satellite constellations worldwide. More specifically, they provide cellular data and enable cellular communication, satellite monitoring of ground assets by governments, emergency service to remote areas, and utilization of their frequency spectrums authorized by the FCC and ITU (most importantly).¬†

[Globalstar recognizes revenue from its Spectrums under the ‚ÄúWholesale capacity services‚Äù segment, and its respective 51&#37; and 31&#37; increases for the 3\/9 month periods ending in 2024 compared to 2023 illustrates its importance as a driver of operating profits.](https://preview.redd.it/7aitpeu2ug9e1.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=79a85edf5fb76472b8c076573edd6d8861479b5c)

[Revenue has been steadily increasing, even through rocky macroeconomics](https://preview.redd.it/o1b7g5ecug9e1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=be6fa6c5d32200883db22aff0379bde53bbb2e96)

Authorizations for ownership of terrestrial spectrums are often lengthy endeavors and require a demonstration of competence by any company seeking them. The fact that Globalstar has secured L-band and S-band spectrum authorizations gives it a massive competitive advantage and access to a wider variety of international populations and markets than competitors.



In addition to this competitive advantage, Apple recently initiated a 20% stake in the company and provided them with $1.1 billion in funding (paid in quarterly installments) to pay down debts and for use of their services. This 20% equity stake emphasizes that Apple views Globalstar as a company with significant growth potential rather than a simple operating partner.¬†



And it‚Äôs not just Apple buying in either‚Ä¶  


https://preview.redd.it/k0m4nv9mug9e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ad21bd9dc33f91d8cf73c39078fa1488521138c

Institutional ownership of Globalstar is up across the board, with names like JPMorgan and Fidelity rebalancing their investments and taking stakes outright.

I believe that Globalstar‚Äôs current undervaluation is due to its historic balance sheet weakness and continued share dilution. However, the $1.1B in funding from Apple provides it with a solid runway and cushion from debt.¬†

More recently, they filed to effect a reverse stock split. This split would address their ongoing share dilution issues, provide additional liquidity for lot trading (blocks of 100 shares that benefit from lower commissions and fees), and a path to NASDAQ listing.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/hoitjsrrug9e1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=23efe4b77ce65b23157ee66bea04ab4a273b129c

I believe that this company‚Äôs valuation currently reflects outdated historic data, and is not priced appropriately given these most recent developments. The consensus price target is currently set at $5, but having been beaten down for nearly 2 decades, I would expect any spark to ignite a rally that extends far above this target.",AAPL,Apple

So it appears that outside of NVIDA is getting the bulk of the money.   One thing that troubles me I am not seeing things I expect.

  
1) Why is there not more jobs with programmers who can build AI projects?  You would think you see both a demand for Data Extraction and Training Models with Python Frameworks out there.  The jobs seems to actually pay kind of low.

2) Why are we not really seeing a huge boost of Hardware components. You would think both memory and HDD would be hard to find if the data center buildouts are having money thrown at them?

3) Do the investments in companies like Open AI with Microsoft actually involve cash or are they just swaps for credit time used? Not Sure this is public but a pretty big deal.

4) Government Lobbiest  - Open ai claims it's a big expense however not sure there is angle to play on this

  
Now here things I am seeing that is good.

1) It seems like data centers are being utilized perhaps servers are not being retired?   Data center costs though have increased

2) there is almost certainly an increase in Electricity Usage. This means companies that sell components for electrical are actually making money. Think Eaton  along with anyone who provides electricity.

3) bandwidth use.  There is a huge spike and increase in tier 1 bandwidth. 

4) Obviously NVDA but that something everyone knows at this point.

2024-12-27,16:18:54,WallStreetBets,"NVIDIA's GPU monster is about to come out of the cage, and today's prices will be its starting point.","The Nvidia Blackwell B300 series processors excel in a number of ways that make them an important breakthrough in AI, big data, and hyperscale computing:



1. Dramatic Performance Improvements

The B300 series delivers a 50% increase in compute performance over the B200 series. This performance increase is not only achieved through more compute cores and higher clock frequencies, but also through a more optimized 4NP process (Nvidia's custom 4nm process). For applications that need to process complex AI models, the B300 delivers more efficient computing power, especially in the areas of machine learning, deep learning and high-performance computing.



2. Extra memory and bandwidth

The B300 is equipped with a 12-Hi HBM3E memory stack providing 288GB of memory and 8TB/s of bandwidth. The increased memory capacity enables it to handle larger datasets, making it particularly suitable for training large language models (LLMs) and handling long sequence inference tasks. Higher memory bandwidth accelerates data access and processing, reduces latency, and improves model inference and training efficiency.



3. Lower inference cost

Since the B300 supports processing larger batches and extended sequence lengths, it significantly reduces latency in the inference process and lowers inference costs. For example, the ability to triple inference efficiency allows the full computational power of each GPU to be utilized, thus reducing the cost required to generate the number of tokens per second.



4. Innovative interconnect technology

The B300 utilizes the 800G ConnectX-8 NIC, which provides twice the bandwidth of its predecessor for large-scale clusters and supports more PCIe lanes (48 instead of 32). This enables more efficient data sharing across multiple GPUs, significantly improving overall cluster throughput and computing efficiency, making it ideal for large-scale distributed and cloud computing applications.



5. More flexible supply chain and customization

Nvidia has changed its traditional sales model by no longer supplying complete server hardware, but instead offering core components such as SXM Puck modules and Grace CPUs to OEMs and ODMs, allowing customers to customize them according to their needs. This change brings higher flexibility and scalability to better adapt to the needs of different enterprises, especially for hyperscale data centers and cloud computing vendors, where customization can improve overall performance and efficiency.



6. Higher Scalability

For hyperscale organizations, the B300's NVLink 72 (NVL72) architecture enables 72 GPUs to collaborate on the same problem with low latency. Compared to traditional 8 GPU configurations, the B300 significantly improves batch size scalability, reduces costs and increases the intelligence of the inference chain. This makes the B300 computationally and economically efficient for large-scale inference tasks.



7. Efficient Cooling and Energy Management

Although the power consumption of the B300 series has increased (TDP of 1,400W), the B300 is able to dynamically allocate and adjust power between the CPU and GPU to maximize overall energy efficiency, thanks to a more efficient dynamic power allocation mechanism. Additionally, its design allows for a more efficient water cooling system, which helps reduce operating costs and improve system stability.



Value Proposition

Improved Computing Efficiency: The B300 Series is capable of handling larger datasets and more complex AI models, making it suitable for organizations that require high-performance computing, such as those in the areas of deep learning, inference services, large-scale AI model training, and other applications.

Reduced inference costs: With higher memory capacity and bandwidth, the B300 significantly reduces the cost per inference and improves economics, which is a huge value-add for cloud providers or organizations offering AI services.

Flexible customization: Nvidia's new supply chain model enables organizations to choose the most appropriate hardware configuration for their needs, reducing overall procurement costs and increasing flexibility.

Underpinning Hyperscale Computing: The B300 is a significant technology upgrade for data centers, cloud giants, and other hyperscale computing platforms (e.g., Amazon, Google, Meta), helping them scale compute capacity more efficiently and improve performance.



In summary, the B300 series not only brings significant improvements in multiple aspects such as performance, memory, bandwidth, and energy management, but also provides greater adaptability and scalability through a flexible supply chain and customized design, helping enterprises achieve higher efficiency and lower operating costs in large-scale computing and AI applications.",NVDA,NVIDIA

Now I show up and I‚Äôm greeted by some purple haired thing named Skylar. The amount of rainbow employees i've been seeing at different locations has made me gag, If I genuinely wanted a questionable gender-fluid experience, I‚Äôd just invest in coins again.

**Healthier Options = Brain Activity = Lost Sales**¬†

look, I go to Dutch Bros because I want 500 grams of sugar in a single gulp. I‚Äôm not here to think about the caloric content of my caramel macchi-whatever-the-fuck. Studies (these are harvard studies if you cucks wanna try and question me) show that when you force customers to think, you lose money. Give me my diabetes-in-a-cup and let me die happy. Also who the fuck buys a protein coffee, get a grip .

**Competition is Thiccker than a Nikola motors truck**¬†

Expansion is a bitch when you‚Äôre trying to out-coffee Starbucks, Dunkin‚Äô, and every bearded hipster in a food truck. You really think $BROS can find prime corners in big cities when SBUX has already claimed every intersection and half the alleyways? Good luck with that. They might as well set up shop in the middle of bumfuck iowa at least they‚Äôll have a monopoly there.

**Real Estate: From Tiny Shacks to Big-Ass Buildings**

The beauty of Dutch Bros was their huts‚Äîlittle shacks that cost roughly the same as an average tiny 3d printed home. Now I‚Äôm seeing thicker stores with actual indoor/outdoor seating, meaning sky-high overhead.¬†

If you're regarded: More real estate = more capital expenses = less margin. you start letting customers inside, and guess what? They might linger, think about what they‚Äôre buying and worst of all might even realize they can just make their own coffee at home like a finance guru on¬† youtube

**Expansion Costs & Financial Fuckery**

Yea yea $BROS wants to open 1,500 stores in the next decade. Each new location can cost up to \~$1M in capex (im sure ur all have finance degrees and know what this means). With an average check size that barely pays your rent (assuming you ever move out of your mom‚Äôs basement) or even covers a 3d printed house , that‚Äôs a metric shit-ton of $9 coffees just to break even.Meanwhile, $SBUX is sitting on every corner, flexing their global supply chain and brand recognition. And where are the profits?? Last quarter, $BROS had a net loss of around $16 million while ‚Äúexpanding.‚Äù Their operating margin makes my match rate on hinge look good. Their P/S ratio implies theyre the TSLA of coffee, but let‚Äôs face it they can only dream of . To add onto this their new CEO looks more bullish on $MCD than she is on $BROS, christin barron if you're reading this: sign up for equinox, get you some $PTON, and maybe ill buy some of your shares.

The only bullish thing is that their CEO is a whale (and not the kind that buys shares) meaning she probably buys her own produce¬†

Finally hit a Billy. Been waiting on this for years. $RDW is the Next Space Stock You Need to Watch ‚Äì Bigger Than $ASTS or $RKLB?

NOTE: tried originally posting this on 10/14, 11/04, and 11/30 and WSB told me I couldn‚Äôt because RDW was ‚Äúunder 500m market cap‚Äù which is wasn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ now trading >$10 a share.¬†

I've been following $RDW (Redwire) for four years now, ever since it IPO‚Äôd via a SPAC. I originally owned the stock back at the IPO, sold it before it fully crashed down to $2, and repurchased 10,000 shares at ~$2.50. I‚Äôve bought and sold on the way up and on dips, currently holding 4,500 shares with a cost basis of $3.83. I also hold two call contracts at a $4 strike price expiring in May 2025.

I‚Äôm a long-term believer in $RDW and believe it has the potential to be one of the biggest winners in the space industry long term, with significant potential for short-term spikes. This post isn‚Äôt about denouncing other space stocks but more about why I believe $RDW can be the winner we all want and need.

NOTE: before diving in, this was originally written on Oct 14, 2024. I‚Äôve since updated this with current numbers as of Nov 30, 2024¬†

Valuation Insights: Why $RDW is Undervalued

Now, let‚Äôs talk about valuation. When looking at revenue versus market cap, $RDW is trading at a much lower multiple than its peers, despite earning more and losing less than almost all of them. This presents a strong case for potential upside if the market starts to recognize its growth.

* $RDW¬†
    * Market Cap: $524.3M (as of Oct 14 at $7.88/share)
        * As of Nov 30, market cap is now $928.9m
    * Revenue multiple: Just 1.69x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, revenue multiple is 3x
* For comparison:
    * $RKLB: ~10x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, 25x¬†
    * $ASTS: 100x revenue
    * $LUNR: ~2-2.5x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, 4.5x
* Why This Matters
    * A lower revenue multiple suggests that $RDW is currently undervalued relative to its peers. It‚Äôs trading at just 1.69x revenue, compared to $RKLB‚Äôs 10x or $SPCE‚Äôs 15x, despite immense market traction and success. If Redwire continues on its growth trajectory, this gap in valuation could close quickly, creating a significant upside opportunity.

Proven Track Record

$RDW has been involved in space missions for more than 50 years, supporting missions to practically every planet in our solar system.¬†
* Sun: 3 missions
* Mercury: 2 missions
* Venus: 3 missions
* Earth: 20 missions
* ISS: 12 missions
* Moon: 4 missions
* Mars: 7 missions
* Asteroids: 3
* Jupiter: 2
* Saturn: 1
* Pluto: 1

Redwire is positioned as a leader in several emerging space technologies that could be game-changers in the next decade. The possibilities here are immense‚Äîespecially with space-based manufacturing, pharma, and autonomous operations becoming key areas of growth in the sector.

The Opportunity: Why Now is the Time

With everything mentioned above, $RDW presents a major opportunity, but here‚Äôs why now could be the time to get in:
* Outstanding shares: 66.54M
* Float: 24.26M (very small compared to peers):
    * $RKLB: 340M
    * $ASTS: 122M
    * $LUNR: 57M
* Short interest: 2.58M shares (10.62% of float)
    * As of Nov 30, short interest is 3M (12% of float)
* Average daily volume: 340k (very low compared to peers):
    * $LUNR: 14.2M
    * $RKLB: 13.1M
    * $ASTS: 16.9M
* Average Daily Volume as of Nov 30: 481k
    * $LUNR: 19.18m
    * $RKLB: 18.52m
    * $ASTS: 12.83m

Low float and low trading volume make $RDW more prone to sharp price movements, especially if the market starts to recognize the value that‚Äôs been overlooked. Add to that the upcoming earnings reports and potential contracts in the pipeline, and you have a recipe for significant price action.

Conclusion:
Given $RDW‚Äôs impressive revenue growth, proven track record, undervaluation compared to peers, and potential for short-term spikes due to low float and trading volume, this is a stock to keep an eye on. While I hold positions in other space stocks, my conviction in $RDW remains the strongest for long-term growth.
* Past
    * Jan 1, 2024: $2.96 ($196.9m market cap - lower than the 2023 revenue)
    * Oct 14: $7.88 (524.3m market cap)
* Today:
    * Nov 30: $13.96 (928.9m market cap)
* Future Potential?:
    * $20 ($1.33b market cap // 4x 2024 rev)
    * $50 ($3.32b market cap // 10x 2024 rev)
    * $100 ($6.65b market cap // 20x 2024 rev)

This cohort of tech employees are the ones that got the easiest interviews, and were able to uplift themselves into better companies even amongst themselves.

This means that someone who started their job on the first day of 2021 (assuming equity deposits, etc. happened the same way, they don't but just imagine), they should have gone to META and not AMZN.

Surprisingly GOOGL turned out to be the best bet in terms of volatility and performance. I can imagine META employees dumping their stock and not holding, GOOGL employees usually do auto sale, but the ones who kept it and didn't sell probably did well.

MSFT and AAPL employees also did well. Good times.",AAPL,Apple

2024-12-23,00:52:51,WallStreetBets,Nvidia will moon - In Depth Benchmarking tests of AMD MX300 vs Nvidia H100 and H200 by SemiAnalysis,"tl:dr - the world is as expected. AMD's software needs lots of hand holding and support, Nvidia's runs very well right out of the box. Nvidia maintains performance advantage in nearly every test run. [https://semianalysis.com/2024/12/22/mi300x-vs-h100-vs-h200-benchmark-part-1-training/](https://semianalysis.com/2024/12/22/mi300x-vs-h100-vs-h200-benchmark-part-1-training/)

  
Key Findings

\- Comparing on paper FLOP/s and HBM Bandwidth/Capacity is akin to comparing cameras by merely examining megapixel count. The only way to tell the actual performance is to run benchmarking.

\- Nvidia‚Äôs Out of the Box Performance & Experience is amazing, and we did not run into any Nvidia specific bugs during our benchmarks. Nvidia tasked a single engineer to us for technical support, but we didn‚Äôt run into any Nvidia software bugs as such we didn‚Äôt need much support.

\- AMD‚Äôs Out of the Box Experience is very difficult to work with and can require considerable patience and elbow grease to move towards a usable state. On most of our benchmarks, Public AMD stable releases of AMD PyTorch is still broken and we needed workarounds.

\- If we weren‚Äôt supported by multiple teams of AMD engineers triaging and fixing bugs in AMD software that we ran into, AMD‚Äôs results would have been much lower than Nvidia‚Äôs.

\- We ran unofficial MLPerf Training GPT-3 175B on 256 H100 in collaboration with Sustainable Metal Cloud to test the effects of different VBoost setting

\- For AMD, Real World Performance on public stable released software is nowhere close to its on paper marketed TFLOP/s. Nvidia‚Äôs real world performance also undershoots its marketing TFLOP/s, but not by nearly as much.

\- The MI300X has a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to the H100/H200, but training performance per TCO is higher on the MI300X on public stable releases of AMD software. This changes if one uses custom development builds of AMD software.

\- Training performance is weaker, as demonstrated by the MI300X ‚Äòs matrix multiplication micro-benchmarks, and AMD public release software on single-node training throughput still lags that of Nvidia‚Äôs H100 and H200.

\- MI300X performance is held back by AMD software. AMD MI300X software on BF16 development branches have better performance but has not yet merged into the main branch of AMD‚Äôs internal repos. By the time it gets merged into the main branch and into the PyTorch stable release, Nvidia Blackwell will have already been available to everyone.

\- AMD‚Äôs training performance is also held back as the MI300X does not deliver strong scale out performance. This is due to its weaker ROCm Compute Communication Library (RCCL) and AMD‚Äôs lower degree of vertical integration with networking and switching hardware compared to Nvidia‚Äôs strong integration of its Nvidia Collective Communications Library (NCCL), InfiniBand/Spectrum-X network fabric and switches.

\- Many of AMD AI Libraries are forks of NVIDIA AI Libraries, leading to suboptimal outcomes and compatibility issues.

\- AMD customers tend to use hand crafted kernels only for inference, which means their performance outside of very narrow well defined use cases is poor, and their flexibility to rapidly shifting workloads is non-existent.",NVDA,NVIDIA

Warning : I am heavily invested  in high risk ETFS  I wil name them bellow . I started accumulating this week.

A Key Reminder from a Legendary Investor:
One of the most respected fixed-income investors of all time‚Äîwhom Warren Buffett sought advice from‚ÄîMark Howard‚Äôs once said:

‚ÄúThe market can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent.‚Äù
You may think the market is overpriced, but the premium you‚Äôre paying for American stocks is justified because the U.S. is the world‚Äôs greatest economy.

Keep in mind this is from someone that does not invest a penny in securities or seldom does and continues to buy bonds when the 2008 crash occurred he was considered one of the smartest since his portfolio barely took a hit and made billions upon billions afterwards.

He greatly reminds us that investing is a losers game, and predicting the future is not possible


On  that  note you can for certain know that whatever what happened in the past 
 is not a good indication of future Performance , but you can be certain that you can analyze today and today is American economic exceptionalism

For dummies this means that there is no greater economy, American exceptionalism was a political word used by the early settlers. Almost every president uses it but today you are actually living it . A beacon light upon a hill, in which the eyes of the world is set up on us, an example to the world.

I have a minor in political science -once I thought it would be useless  to study . I did for fun 


What I Know for Sure:
While I can‚Äôt predict what will happen tomorrow, here‚Äôs what I can say about today:

There‚Äôs never been a better time to find a job. Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and younger generations aren‚Äôt filling those gaps. With immigration restrictions tightening, job openings will continue to rise.

**Interest Rates & Inflation**

Whether rates go up, down, or stay the same, any shift is just an opportunity to buy. Despite inflation, GDP growth will likely outpace any downturns. All signs point to a strong American economy.

**Political Environment:**

The new administration may bring volatility and media distractions, but over time, you‚Äôll get used to it.  And the market will get use to it , in fact it will become almost meaningless . 
As long as the economy remains strong, those disruptions won‚Äôt matter.


**Final Thought from Warren Buffett:**
In Buffett‚Äôs words, America is like a train that keeps moving forward, picking up more passengers along the way. Occasionally, it may get derailed or need to stop, but it will always get back on track and keep moving forward.

You will never know why he sold yet , is it because his age ? is it because he actually believes at the market is overvalued ? if so, he would have listen to Mark Howard‚Äôs in his recent interview I believe it is more of a shifting of strategy plus or minus his given age and his future holdings not a reflection of what he believes about the American economy

PLTR sold 2/3 at 400% gain rest are locked forever 
TSLA 170 average any major dip is honey - the Cinderal story

Guys, you are trying to sell ice to eskimos here. Every single market participants already owns too much of this stock. Almost no one can take the risk of concentrating further by buying what you are trying to sell.

2025-01-27,18:09:17,StockMarket,Seems like it's a well coodinated efforts by the WS shorters. I can't wait to see Gemma Squeeze,"This is not AI generated spam. This is my personal view on what is happening today. 

DeepSeek V3 was released to the public on December 26, 2024. By early January, the market was already aware that DeepSeek outperforms OpenAI's GPT-4o and Meta's Llama in benchmark tests, having been developed at a cost of only $5.58 million.

In early January, Nvidia dropped as low as $129 due to profit-taking after reaching the height of $153+, partly influenced by the DeepSeek news, but it recovered to $147 just last week. So why the sudden barrage fearmongering articles now triggering a sell-off?

It‚Äôs not that the demand for Nvidia chips will drop; it‚Äôs about how to produce superior LLMs using the latest Nvidia chip in the AI race. Imagine what the DeepSeek team could achieve with Nvidia's latest chip. We are only at the start of AGI, they still need those high tech chips in the AGI and ASI race. 

Seems like it's a well coodinated efforts by the WS shorters. I can't wait see Gamma Squeeze.

2025-01-27,17:57:44,StockMarket,Market down today when Deepseek is month old news,"The news that Deepseek was trained with $5.5 million worth of equipment and was comparable to ChatGPT came out on December 26th. A whole month ago. 

They used Nvidia H800 GPUs which are a reduced version of the H100 made specifically for China. They are about half the speed of an H100

The market reacted slightly back then but not very much. News articles were even saying Microsoft was pausing its data center buildouts with the assumption it was because of Deepseek and the possibility of needing far fewer GPUs. They also claimed it was 10 times more efficient 

Does anyone know why such a huge reaction today when this is very old news?

I know this is emotion talking, convincing me to get out, but it's so overwhelming. How do you overcome the urge to panic sell whenever your positions straight up tank? 


And no, I don't mean tanking as in a stock going down a few percentage points kind of way, I mean it as a ""just going to absolute shit"" like NVDA now kind of way. What do you tell yourself? How do you hype yourself up? How do you not give in to the fear, uncertainty and doubt narratives around you? And how do you know whether you're really acting out of fear instead of rational caution if it's so hard to tell the difference?

2025-01-24,18:45:49,StockMarket,$500B Stargate AI Project: What Sectors and Stocks Could Win Big?,"So, the $500 billion Stargate AI Project was just announced, and honestly, that‚Äôs a huge amount of money being thrown into AI and related tech. It‚Äôs got me thinking: what sectors and companies could ride this wave in the near future? If history tells us anything, investments of this scale tend to shake up entire industries, with both big names and under-the-radar players benefiting.

Let‚Äôs break it down by sector because there‚Äôs a lot to unpack here:

1. Semiconductors: The Brains Behind AI

AI doesn‚Äôt run without hardware, and semiconductors are at the heart of it all. GPUs, CPUs, and those fancy AI-specialized chips are the foundation of machine learning. Companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel are already dominating this space, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they see even more demand. Nvidia, especially, is practically the poster child for AI hardware. Their growth has been insane, and a project of this magnitude could push it even further. Expect AI chips to continue driving their revenue in the coming years.

2. Cloud Computing & Data Centers

AI projects need a ton of computing power and storage. That‚Äôs where the big cloud providers‚ÄîAWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud‚Äîcome in. These companies are likely already gearing up to grab their slice of the Stargate pie. Then you‚Äôve got data center companies like Equinix and Digital Realty Trust, which could also benefit. All this AI data has to live somewhere, and these companies provide the backbone for hosting it.

3. AI Software Players

It‚Äôs not just about the hardware‚Äîcompanies building the actual AI tools and software are in a great spot, too. Think Palantir, C3.ai, and Snowflake. These players already help businesses make sense of their data and implement AI-driven solutions, so they could see a major surge in demand. The rise of AI as a service (AIaaS) could also give these companies a big boost as the Stargate Project moves forward.

4. Startups: The Dark Horses

This is where things get really interesting. While the big names are obvious winners, startups working on niche AI applications (think robotics, edge computing, and automation) could also see some major growth. Some of these smaller companies aren‚Äôt on anyone‚Äôs radar right now, but they could pop up as key players‚Äîor even get acquired by the bigger guys. If you‚Äôre into high-risk, high-reward opportunities, this might be where you want to look.

5. Telecom & Networking: Supporting the AI Boom

AI depends on fast, low-latency networks to transfer data efficiently. That‚Äôs why telecom and networking companies are probably smiling right now. Companies like Cisco, Juniper Networks, and even those working on 5G infrastructure could benefit. After all, all that AI data has to move through fast, reliable connections, and these are the folks making that possible.

6. Autonomous Tech & EVs

This one‚Äôs a bit of a wildcard, but it makes sense. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Mobileye that are working on self-driving cars and autonomous tech could see a boost. AI is critical for advancing self-driving capabilities, and a major investment like this might accelerate developments in the space.

7. Cybersecurity

As AI adoption grows, so do concerns around data privacy and security. Cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Zscaler could also be beneficiaries. Protecting sensitive AI systems and the data they process is going to be a top priority.

So, what do you all think? Are there other sectors or companies that might benefit? Any smaller names worth keeping an eye on? Let‚Äôs discuss!

I begin stock picking in november and i got some big poop stock in my portfolio :

\- AMD at 138 dollars : when i see nvidia, qualcomm, broadcomm, tsmc growing fast, but AMD falling from 138 to 110... i guess i make the worst choice ever, even i did in the presentation of the new generation of CPU for BtoC and BtoB.

\- Ocean power technologies:  Lot of ""analyst"" said that was a very good company. I took a position at 1.10 after a fall from 1.80 dollars. I was like ""ok i guess it's the floor. No, today the stock is at 0.80 . And more the time pass, more the stock is falling step by step.

\- Cheniere : i took a position, i waited two weeks to take some because the stock was growing fast. Finally i took at 250 after a fall from 260. Guess what ? the stock is at 235 now ... Like AMD, i begin a position with -6% 

\- Pernod Ricard : Top 2 in premium international wines and spirits.¬†lot of ""analyst"" said the earning was just a tempory issue, and the next earning will be better. But today, like OPTT, the stock is falling step by step : one step forward, two steps back.

Honeslty, i dont knwo what i can do with that. I would like to complete my portofolio with Energy stocks and financial stock (i took an ETF finally), and some tech. But the price are growing, i don't know when i should take a position. I've been monotoring Intuitive surgical. I would like to take a position after a fall, but no, the stock beats ATH day after day. Vertiv and Broadcomm the same. We can talk about Synopsys too. But everytime i take a position in green period, i lost money the next day with a big fall (OPTT, AMD, Cheniere)

The iPhone remains Apple's anchor product, but services and wearables offer growth potential. Risks include economic downturns, tariffs, and regulatory pressures.
Apple's loyal investor base often allocates entire portfolios to the stock.


Downgrades: 

Ananda Baruah, analyst from Loop Capital, downgraded Apple from ""Buy"" to ""Hold,"" with a revised price target of $230, down from $275. The analyst concerned over iPhone demand reduction since March 2024.

Similarly Jeffries analyst Edison Lee also downgraded Apple from ""Hold"" to ""Underperform"" with price target of $200.75 citing weak iPhone demand especially from China where iPhone shipments were projected to decline by 2% for the December quarter.

Today's dip aside I can sell my shares and still make a bit of profit off them.

My question is what are people's general thoughts/opinions on Tesla? 

No one can read the future I know, but do you think the price could keep rising and is worth holding or is it getting a bit too risky to hold with Elon getting more involved in politics and Trump pushing the oil motive. Elon dropping questionable salutes during his speeches probably doesn't help confidence levels either üòÖ ",TSLA,Tesla
2025-01-20,04:44:44,StockMarket,Can Intel Rebound from Quagmire?,"Intel was THE company in Silicon Valley. 

Now, they have been losing market shares to AMD in CPU markets, and lagging behind NVIDIA in AI chip markets. Just experienced worst financial year in several decades in 2024.

Can they turnaround?

Seems like new Co-CEO picks are decent. Both of them are industry/Intel veterans, so they should know the business very well. 

Not so fan about them being non-Technical people. Both of them are finance/marketing experts, not engineer or science types.

Spinning off foundry business is good move.

Investing to upgrade their old manufacturing site is the must. Question is how fast they can capture the gap. Is $100 B enough?

Can they restore their engineer/technical division pipeline back again? Once they were top engineering company. Can they revive that aura?

2025-01-15,21:21:35,StockMarket,Trading and surfing: 5 steps to building your ideal setup,"Hi all,

I'm a husband, and dad of five, and I've recently transitioned to full time trading.

I wanted to post some concepts that I've found helpful in my trading journey, and in doing so maybe help someone who's thinking of, or working on transitioning to full time trading.

Writing out these concepts has been really helpful for teaching myself different nuances in trading and since I was doing it anyway I thought I'd post it here to potentially help others.

Would also love feedback on my concepts and ideas and to hear about how you guys find the right ""conditions"" for your trading setups.

Here's my post:  
(These are basically notes to myself)

What is a trading ‚ÄúSetup‚Äù?

To me, a setup is a set of clear conditions needed to enter and exit a trade.

And to help understand these concepts, I like look at them through the lens of surfing.

Here‚Äôs what I mean; Surfers need certain conditions to be met in order to enter the water, paddle out, and consistently catch waves.

Conditions like location of the body of water, time of year, and daily weather patterns all play a part. They also need to consider if the surf spot is crowded, what type of waves they‚Äôre trying to catch based on the season, where they will start their wave, and where they‚Äôll exit. They also need to ensure there are safety measures in place.

When combined, these conditions determine the surfers chance of success.

After thousands of attempts that surfer will have a very good understanding of the conditions needed to consistently catch waves. And he will be very specific about those conditions being met in the future, to ensure consistency.

Trading is no different.

# Make it your own.

It‚Äôs become clear to me that to be successful over time, every trader must build out their own specific trading conditions that need to be met (trade setups) in order to find trading‚Äôs holy grail: consistency.

It‚Äôs easy to think setups are best copied from your favorite trader‚Äîand yes, this is often a good foundation‚Äîbut consider a quote from one of my favorite trading authors:

""What if we simply focused on what we understand, what we do well, what makes sense to us?""¬†‚Äì Mike Bellafiore

This makes a lot of sense to me because you are a unique person, with certain traits, talents and abilities. You have individual likes, dislikes, goals, desires, and curiosities.

Just as every surfer is unique, so is every trader. You must eventually carve you‚Äôre own path.

I started to get super curious about large and mid-caps on the Nasdaq after I came across traders like¬†Steve Spencer¬†and¬†SMB Capital.

Steve shares examples of how to take advantage of intraday moves in these liquid leaders and I wanted to find more examples‚Äîto see how and why people are doing this‚Äîso I turned to twitter(X). I questioned and observed how people are thinking about setups in this sector.

The volume and variety of ways people trade is mind-blowing. A clear pattern emerged: each trader developed their own set of conditions through countless trade attempts (reps), staying persistent and learning from their mistakes - making small tweaks along the way with each lesson learned.

‚ÄúThere are no silver bullets, only golden bibi‚Äôs‚Äù - Unknown

Over time I came to realize this sector of the market was a good place for me to start for several reasons:

1. The (mostly) absent fat-tail risk found in small-cap stocks.
2. The liquidity available to get in and out easily.
3. The variety of ways to leverage trades through things like leveraged ETFs and options.
4. The consistency of moves and catalysts that come from these particular stocks, making them easier to catalogue.
5. Scalability over time.

To help you explore this yourself, I‚Äôll explain five common principles to help you find your conditions. I do this to remind myself and to hopefully support you in building your own setups (conditions) to find consistency.

As you read this post, I encourage you to think about a sector or financial product that has peaked your interest for one reason or another, and what conditions might be needed to suit your needs.

# 5 Principles to creating your own setups

# 1. Narrow your focus - be specific. (What body of water will you surf?)

One common theme I see in all successful traders is being in the right stocks at the right time, and being very specific about it.

A common saying amongst traders - ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre only as good as the stocks you trade‚Äù

Let me explain using the surfing analogy again:  
(I‚Äôll be doing that a lot in this post)

‚ÄùYou‚Äôre only as good as the waves you surf‚Äù

From careful observation over time, surfers know that the best waves typically happen in Hawaii. Specifically on the north shore of Hawaii.

And just like the surfer, not every trade is worth ‚Äúpaddling out‚Äù for. Your job is to find the conditions (a location) where the stocks are moving well and most suited to your abilities. Being in the right place at the right time is everything. Think about it, if you don‚Äôt have waves to surf you end up swimming in circles.¬†Trading is no different.

In trading this could be narrowing your focus to large caps with at least a $10 billion market cap and trading at least 1 million shares premarket, and trading them at the open of the trading day when there is the most volume. Or you could look at small cap stocks that have gapped at least 20%. Personally, I like large and mid cap stocks that are trading at least 2-3 times their normal volume in the premarket.

Wherever you focus, the principle is this:

Just like the surfer, you must find a very specific location or sector of the market that is known to consistently produce great trades (waves).

# 2. Stocks are like elastic bands (Are we in the right season for surfing?)

Now that we have our first condition - location - we need to find our specific time frame when the ‚Äúwaves‚Äù are at their best.

For surfers, November to February is the prime surfing season in Hawaii.  
It‚Äôs when the ocean is most ‚Äúout of balance‚Äù and producing the best waves.

Stocks need to rebalance and find equilibrium, just like the ocean.  
We can often see this imbalance when looking at the price chart (I personally like to start with the daily chart in my search).

The more stretched or compressed a stock is, combined with the amount of time it remains in that state, the greater the probability of an outsized move is coming (wave to surf).

Just as surfers recognize certain patterns in the seasons, traders start to recognize patterns in the price charts that show them when a stock is out of balance and whether it‚Äôs in the right ‚Äúseason‚Äù for trading.

Check out the example below. Here‚Äôs a stock that looks out of balance to me and that I think was ready for a wave:

https://preview.redd.it/gauvnirgu7de1.png?width=2551&format=png&auto=webp&s=93618fc78414fd2df5e6c5b4a5e7d1053d6a509b

Nvidia had been building pressure (compressed) for two months. Instead of heading back down, it paused mid-channel, making a ‚Äúhigher low‚Äù and started pushing up to the upper level of the trend. The pressure that was building released, and it broke out to the previous high from the candle on the far left. This change in price action (for me it was the higher low) signals it was time to get interested and dig a bit deeper.

Surf‚Äôs up!

# 3. Catalysts are key to finding consistency (What‚Äôs the weather like today?)

Think about the conditions we have so far:

1. Sector/stock (location)
2. Daily pattern (time of season)

For our third condition, we‚Äôre talking about catalysts (think weather on the day)...

In the case of a surfer, they‚Äôre observing if the day‚Äôs weather conditions match with the location and time of season. If they‚Äôre in Hawaii > on the north shore > in January > they know from hard-won experience that the perfect weather includes the following:

* Big Swells: January is part of Hawaii's peak surf season, with large swells generated by winter storms in the North Pacific. Wave heights typically range from 6-20+ feet, depending on the spot (e.g., Pipeline, Sunset Beach, or Waimea Bay).
* Clean Surf: Ideal conditions have minimal wind or light offshore winds (blowing from the land to the sea), which keep the waves clean and well-shaped.
* Swell Direction :A west-northwest to northwest swell direction is optimal for the North Shore, as it aligns well with most surf breaks.
* Mild Air Temperatures: Daytime highs: 75‚Äì80¬∞F (24‚Äì27¬∞C).Nighttime lows: Around 65‚Äì70¬∞F (18‚Äì21¬∞C).
* Sunny or Partly Cloudy Skies: Clear weather enhances visibility and comfort.
* Gentle Winds: Trade winds (northeast) are common but should be light to avoid choppy surf. Ideal wind speeds: 5‚Äì10 mph (8‚Äì16 km/h).
* Water Temperature: Around 75¬∞F (24¬∞C), so a light wetsuit top or rash guard is usually sufficient, but many surfers go without.
* Tide: Tide timing depends on the specific break, but mid to high tide is often preferred for safer and more consistent waves.

Think about how specific that is!  
Now let‚Äôs take that principle over to trading.

In the example of Nvidia, the main catalyst was technical (based mostly on the chart pattern). The stock‚Äôs daily price action had been compressed for a meaningful amount of time, it then started to deviate and move up on volume, to what I deemed as a very key level. Showing me it was potentially ready to change. This (along with a few other variables that are unique to my needs) confirmed it met my conditions for a potential trade on the day.

The ‚Äúweather‚Äù looked good!

Catalysts can of course be non-technical. They can include fresh news, downgrades, upgrades, or surprise earnings reports. These can all be great reasons to enter a trade.

For example, if the market expects $1 per share in earnings, but the company delivers $1.20‚Äîespecially from a new revenue stream‚Äîit can spark a powerful move.

For the surfer, the weather conditions need to match up with the location and season in order to create good waves.

For the trader, the best catalysts will nearly always match up with the first two conditions; location (stock) and time of season (daily pattern).

With thousands of reps, just as it becomes second nature to a seasoned surfer, the same is true for the experienced trader.

Tip:¬†In the early stages of your trading career, just like a young surfer, be specific and write out every nuance you notice when you see big trades (waves). It could be things like what the volume is doing, what‚Äôs the sector doing, how it‚Äôs acting in the premarket or around certain key levels, what‚Äôs the open interest in the option chains, are there big buyers or sellers on the tape? etc. This gives you more data to cross reference over time and allows you to gain experience faster. Don‚Äôt forget to record your screen so you can replay the trades! Upload your recordings to YouTube and set them to private for easy reference.

# 4. Volume (Now we‚Äôre in the water, waiting for the wave)

We now have a very solid base of conditions to build on. So far our principles include:

1. Sector/stock (location)
2. Daily pattern (time of season)
3. Catalyst (weather conditions of the day).

Now let‚Äôs talk about the fourth principle: Volume (how many shares are being bought and sold in a certain time frame).

Volume flows give you a sense of the probabilities of the expected move actually taking place.

Again, think of it like a surfer waiting for the next wave; they might have perfect conditions on the day, they just need some confirmation‚Ä¶

They may see a rising bump or swell line on the horizon. This indicates an incoming wave. Surfers look for sets (groups of waves) and gauge the wave's size and speed from its appearance far out at sea.

Traders can do the same with volume!

For example: Is the volume increasing or slowing? Is it more than normal for this stock, sector, or time of day? By how much? Is it spiking or constant?

If the volume looks like it‚Äôs aligning with your conditions, it‚Äôs time to focus.

The wave is coming‚Ä¶

Now one last piece of the puzzle remains.

# 5. Price action (Wait for your signal to enter)

We‚Äôre in the water, waiting‚Ä¶Conditions are perfect.

We have our conditions set:

1. Stock (location) ‚úì
2. Daily pattern (time of season) ‚úì
3. Catalyst (weather on the day) ‚úì
4. Volume (water rises on the horizon) ‚úì

The final piece to the puzzle is price action‚Ä¶

You have a plan in place, you know what you want to see, you just need to wait to see it.

In trading, price action can include things like candlestick patterns, tape reading (one of my favorites), price behavior around certain key levels or indicators, bid and offer sizing on the level II, and many other nuances that simply take time and reps to recognize.

Price action is everything in trading.

It‚Äôs the final piece that tells you if it‚Äôs go time (or not).

I personally love it because feedback is almost instantaneous.  
Some traders call it the ‚Äúonly truth‚Äù in trading.

In surfing I liken it to when you see the white water at the tip of a wave starting to crest, the waves are starting to move faster and break to shore according your angle. This is exactly what you want to see - all signaling your entry.

Time to start paddling.

And depending on the conditions, how hard to paddle. (think position sizing - but more on that later. Right now we just need to practice standing up.)

You‚Äôre paddling, you‚Äôre feeling the wave starting. You stand up on your board, set your sights on managing your ride, and simply follow your plan to the exit.

All your focus is now on the price action during your trade.

Just as a surfer is watching the wave he‚Äôs riding - looking at its curve and shape, its speed, size and watching out for dangers along the way - so is the trader.

You have a plan in place in case you see different variables pop up. But otherwise you‚Äôre simply riding the trade, taking the rep and riding as long as you can, or until you get to your target.

Just like surfing, price action in trading is best learned through experience.  
The more you do it, the more nuances you pick up and the more confident you become.

# Bonus principle: Film your surf session, take notes!

In both surfing and trading, reviewing your performance is essential for improvement. Just as a surfer might film their sessions to analyze technique, you can track and review your trades to identify patterns, strengths, and areas for growth.

Journaling your setups, entry and exit points, and emotional state during trades can provide invaluable insights over time. The goal is to iterate‚Äîrefining your strategy with each trade (wave) to consistently improve your edge and execution.

I hope these principles can help guide as you build out your own unique conditions to become a more consistent and profitable trader.",NVDA,NVIDIA

2025-01-14,19:34:21,StockMarket,Dips Are Where Fortunes Are Made #ACHR,"Alright, folks, let‚Äôs talk about ACHR. If you‚Äôve been following the stock, you know it took a nosedive today. Massive dip. But before we all panic and start dumping shares, let‚Äôs take a breath and look at the bigger picture here. I‚Äôm a long-term optimist on this company, and dips like this? Honestly, they scream opportunity. Let me explain why.  


Fundamentals Still Look Solid  
ACHR has a strong foundation. They‚Äôve successfully completed key test flights and are making real progress toward scaling production. Their partnerships (hello, United Airlines!) aren‚Äôt just hype‚Äîthey‚Äôre strategic moves that set them up for a slice of the eVTOL market pie.  
  
Remember, the eVTOL space isn‚Äôt a sprint; it‚Äôs a marathon. The tech is groundbreaking, and regulators are catching up. This isn‚Äôt just about where ACHR is today but where it could be in the next 3-5 years. If they keep executing on their goals, this dip will look like a blip on the radar.  
  
You know the saying: most millionaires are made during market crashes. It‚Äôs clich√© for a reason. Let‚Äôs take a look at some big names that went through similar rough patches:  
  
Amazon (2000s): Post-dot-com bubble, Amazon crashed hard. People thought the company was done for. Fast forward to today: it‚Äôs a trillion-dollar giant.  
Nvidia (2022): Midway through 2022, Nvidia got crushed during the semiconductor selloff, dropping over 50% from its peak. Fast forward to the AI boom in 2023, and it‚Äôs now one of the hottest stocks around.  
DraftKings (2021-2022): This stock was hammered as growth stocks fell out of favor, dropping over 70%. But those who bought during the lows saw a massive rebound in 2023 as sports betting demand surged.  
The lesson here? Volatility happens, even to the best. But if the fundamentals are strong (which I believe ACHR‚Äôs are), these dips can be golden opportunities.  
  
Why I‚Äôm Buying the Dip  
This isn‚Äôt financial advice (obviously, DYOR), but I see this as a gift. The market‚Äôs overreacting today, as it often does. If you believe in the company and its long-term vision, then today‚Äôs price is a chance to load up at a discount.  
  
Of course, there are risks. Not every company rebounds from a dip like this. But for me, the potential reward outweighs the risk. The eVTOL sector is just getting started, and ACHR is well-positioned to be a leader in it.  
  
So yeah, today sucks if you‚Äôre already holding. But if you‚Äôve got cash on the sidelines or have been waiting for an entry point, this might be it. Personally, I‚Äôm in this for the long haul, and I‚Äôm not letting one bad day scare me off.",NVDA,NVIDIA
2025-01-14,19:29:48,StockMarket,AMD vs. Nvidia: The battle for AI dominance heats up?,"After experiencing a remarkable surge, with its stock price jumping over 100% from $93 to $226 between October 2023 and March 2024, the excitement surrounding its AI accelerator revenue seemed justified. However, reality hit hard when the average selling price (ASP) and margins for the MI300 accelerators turned out to be much lower than expected. This miscalculation led to a significant correction in the stock price, which now sits at $115, which is far below its peak.

Currently, analysts suggest a relative value of $138, while a DCF analysis points to $97.9. With a market cap of $188.31 billion and 1.6 billion shares outstanding, there's a lot to unpack. Institutional ownership is quite strong at 71.34%, which is encouraging, but it's worth noting that short interest is below 5%.

The fourth-quarter guidance wasn‚Äôt exactly a confidence booster for 2025. Many analysts are using linear growth models for AI revenue, which can be misleading. The CPU market isn‚Äôt expected to grow significantly, but AMD has a projected TAM of $500 billion for AI accelerators by 2028. Even if AMD captures just 10% of that, we're looking at over $75 billion in annual revenue by then‚Äîmore than triple the projected 2024 earnings.

When we look at profitability, there‚Äôs a mixed bag. AMD boasts a solid gross margin of 52.12%, exceeding the 40% target, and strong management metrics (all above 10%). However, the net margin is only 7.52%, which is below the desired 10%. The Piotroski F-Score of 6 raises some flags, showing weaknesses like a declining return on assets and gross margin, while the P/E ratio of 101.9x is much higher than the peer median of 37.8x. On a brighter note, AMD has consistently beaten revenue and EPS expectations over the past several years.

Broader economic factors are also weighing on AMD. There‚Äôs been a shift away from large tech stocks to sectors like banking and Bitcoin, and concerns about slower AI infrastructure spending and geopolitical risks are contributing to the stock's struggles. Plus, there's always the looming threat of a significant correction in Nvidia's stock, which could further impact AMD.

Despite these challenges, AMD's recent underperformance has created an intriguing opportunity for investors. The gap between its current valuation and future potential is widening. Insights from CEO Dr. Lisa Su highlight AMD's focus on building customer trust in its new technology and catching up to Nvidia. For instance, the MI325X is only two quarters behind Nvidia's H200, and the launch timing of the MI355X will be crucial.

AMD has several key initiatives in the pipeline that could unlock its potential:

\- Ultra Ethernet and Pensando DPU: Expanding the AI training market in late 2025.

\- ZT Systems: Giving AMD access to major data center projects with hyperscalers.

\- Mature ROCM Libraries: Improving competitiveness, especially regarding total cost of ownership.

\- Support for FP4/FP6/Int8 with MI355X: Removing competitive barriers.

These advancements are largely independent of Nvidia‚Äôs moves, which is a positive sign for AMD.

Looking ahead, the upcoming fourth-quarter report in January 2025 could provide a much-needed boost, especially given the low expectations. However, a larger catalyst related to the MI355X might be necessary to surpass the highs from March 2024. If AMD starts showing strong growth while Nvidia slows down, we could see a shift in the narrative, with more investors turning their attention to AMD.

Of course, there are near-term risks, including potential supply constraints for HBM. But AMD's strategy to diversify its suppliers should help mitigate this. Despite these hurdles, the long-term outlook for AMD remains bright thanks to its innovative technology and expanding market opportunities. Although, insider ownership is low at 0.95%, which is something to watch.",NVDA,NVIDIA

2025-01-13,01:27:30,StockMarket,Recent Activity in Quantum ,"Is quantum a scam? is quantum overvalued? why did quantum drop? what is the future looking like?

So many questions have been brought up in the dramatic rise of quantum computing stocks. Some of the major stocks in this industry include RGTI, IONQ, and QBTS. Shortly put quantum is far from a ""scam"". However, that does not mean it wasn't dramatically overvalued. Stocks like the ones I mentioned incurred extremely high gains in the last few months. But recently all of them dropped significantly. With a combination of the major indices falling into negative territory, NVDA CEO's comments on quantum, and panic selling, prices dropped, and they dropped fast. 

However, this is NOT the first time NVIDIA's CEO has made comments on very useful quantum computing being many years away. I also want to tie this idea into the other idea that it might be beneficial to NVIDIA if stocks like RGTI fall. This is because much of the technology that NVIDIA uses can be overtaken in a much more efficient way, if quantum computing technology continues to grow at the rate it is. ""Once quantum computing becomes powerful enough, it will likely replace some of the uses of GPU data centers with a much smaller footprint and much faster computation,"". This quote was taken from [investors.com](http://investors.com) interview with WallStreet's Davidson, head of technology research: Gill Luria. Additionally, this threat that stocks like RGTI serve to NVDA would become a real possibility in a matter of just a few years (not a multiple decades). Although very useful and mass commercialization of quantum computing may truly be a decade+ away, this threat I am talking about is not. This is just one of possible revenue streams quantum computing companies would be made of within the next few years while they wait for technology to advance. It would not be a shock if these companies rapidly started to grow their earnings within the next few years. 

Lastly, I want to touch on the future of quantum computing. Quantum computing growth is not a question of ""if"", it's just a matter of ""when"". This industry is essential for the rapid advance of all technology. 

This post was made after reading a number of articles, reports, and interviews. A chunk of this information was gained after reading Marc Gerstein's seeking alpha article, ""Quantum Stocks, Including Rigetti Computing, Fell After Comment By VIP, But Reactions Were Irrational"".

Please do your own research and provide any comments regardless of which side of the argument you are on.

2025-01-11,06:25:14,StockMarket,Outstanding Returns by Sheer Luck!,"While reading investment books to get the new year started off right, I came across this gem of an anecdote:



In his book *The Smartest Portfolio You‚Äôll Ever Own*, Daniel Solin advocates for a very Bogle-y approach to investing: pick asset allocations based on risk tolerance, use index funds, and rebalance periodically. (That's a one sentence summary of the whole book. You're welcome.)



Here's the interesting bit: In the chapter ""The Myth of Skill"", Solin claims that ""outstanding returns can be achieved by sheer luck."" Definitely a talking point for index investors. To prove this he picks 10 US stock tickers based only on the letters of his last name: S-O-L-I-N; two for each letter. He claims that from January 2010 through November 2010, these 10 stocks returned 45% to the S&P's less than 6%. But what's really interesting is looking at these 10 stocks through today, 15 years later.



If Solin had invested equally in his 10 ""random"" stocks in January 2010 and then forgot about his account until this month, ***he would have 34x his money***!! Sure, this is another NVDA-go-boom story, but it's amusing because of the context of the picks and being forever immortalized in print.



So, buy index funds -- or throw some darts and hang on for the ride.

1. **Best case:**¬†Tesla or Google acquires them this year and we get a solid premium payday. Probably a stock deal, but it‚Äôs still peanuts compared to Tesla and Google market caps
2. **Second best:**¬†Uber pivots to selling AI training data
3. **Not bad either:**¬†Uber dominates more human-driven marketplaces
4. **Base scenario:**¬†They stick to mobility, keep expanding margins, and¬†*maybe*¬†bolt on third-party AVs

The price of bitcoin is dangerously close to the neckline of this head and shoulders pattern.  
  
Will it find support and work its' way higher? It's already trading below the 20 and 50 day moving averages, and the 200 day is a long way away, so it won't find support there.  
  
Or will it continue down through the neckline and set up an new base below this one?  
  
I have no idea, and anyone telling you that they do is a liar. But if you're buying here be careful.  
  
NVDA recently had a very similar set-up. I bought it as it turned back up, after I believed it had found support below the 20 and the 50 day. So far that trade has worked out for me, but that doesn't mean that BTC will do the same.",NVDA,NVIDIA

2024-12-27,15:59:14,StockMarket,"Was AMD Misplaced? After a cumulative 15% drop this year, it's time to bottom out and rebound","https://preview.redd.it/vohg9vf6ne9e1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=064dadece18e26c0bfb1666b4477028b85a337b3

AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD) stellar management team will be in the spotlight as Intel (INTC) looks for its next CEO. It's important to have stable management and a clear direction for the company. Over the past few years, Intel has changed CEOs frequently, leading to shifting priorities and ultimately hurting the company's growth potential. On the other hand, AMD's shares have risen 50 times since ZF Su took over as CEO in 2014. Over the past few quarters, AMD has rapidly expanded its AI division and is on track for strong results in 2025.



AMD is down 15 percent year-to-date, compared to a 25 percent return for the S&P 500. AMD forecasts $5 billion in AI revenue by 2024. Most analysts expect AI revenue in 2025 to be close to $10 billion. However, this number seems to be underestimated as AMD prepares to launch the next generation of its powerful MI325 and MI350 family of chips. Demand for AMD's chips is very strong, and we're likely to hear from more major customers in the near term. AMD could realize nearly $14-15 billion in AI revenue by 2025, despite limited supply.



AMD stock is trading at less than 17 times fiscal year ending December 2026 earnings per share estimates. Despite strong growth momentum and an expectation that EPS will more than double over the next two years, AMD stock is underperforming in 2024, but if the company is able to beat its AI revenue forecasts, we could see huge bullish momentum in the coming quarters.



AMD stock has pulled back nearly 30% after its recent earnings call, which was a significant pullback despite the company's good earnings results. This is a significant pullback despite the company's decent earnings results. one of the reasons for the drop in AMD's stock price is that Wall Street expects AMD's AI chip sales to be modest by 2025. Most recently, Bank of America downgraded AMD because it predicted AMD would lose market share to hyperscale manufacturers that prefer to use their own custom chips in data centers. Hyperscale manufacturers contribute nearly 50 percent of NVIDIA's data center revenue and are the main reason for NVIDIA's huge revenue and earnings per share growth. Almost all hyperscale manufacturers are developing their own custom chips for cloud business or other core computing needs. However, AMD still offers good value to these hyperscale manufacturers due to significantly lower chip prices compared to NVIDIA and greater flexibility compared to NVIDIA's CUDA platform. AMD also has a small market share in the AI chip industry compared to NVIDIA. Even if some hyperscalers choose their chips, this provides the company with good room for growth.



What could change Wall Street's view of AMD? Analysts believe the next earnings call will be important, as it will give management a chance to lay out plans for AI growth in the coming quarters, and AMD will likely be able to beat Wall Street's expectations for AI revenue. If AMD is able to achieve $15 billion or more in AI revenues by 2025, this would lead to a rapid shift in market sentiment and we could see a significant rally in the stock.



AMD has been managed very well under ZF Su's leadership. Normally, analysts don't mention this factor, but it's becoming increasingly important as Intel searches for another CEO after nearly four years of Pat Kissinger's tenure. AMD shares have risen 50-fold since Su Zifeng joined the company in 2014. We don't often see dramatic changes like this in the corporate world.



Analysts think Intel's foundry strategy was a mistake. The foundry business requires tens of billions of dollars in capital expenditures, and it takes a long time to achieve good results. Intel doesn't have that kind of time. There's also the issue of opportunity cost. Intel was busy expanding its foundry business and missed out on the AI opportunity.



AMD's management is much more flexible and quickly moved to the AI business once it showed great potential. It's worth noting that AMD has been able to exceed their own projections when it comes to AI revenues. at the end of 2023, AMD announced that they expect AI revenues to reach $2 billion by 2024. This number has been increasing throughout the year, and during the most recent earnings season, management announced that AMD would realize $5 billion in AI revenue by 2024. In just 12 months, we've seen AMD's AI forecasts grow 2.5x. This demonstrates the company's ability to rapidly increase chip supply and gain a good customer base.

  
Much of AMD's future growth will come from its AI business, so it's important to properly assess the potential of that business. An earlier Market Watch report noted that Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland estimated that AMD's AI revenue could reach $9 billion by 2025, with $11-12 billion ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù. Oppenheimer's Rick Schafer said $10 billion would be a ‚Äúdifficult number to achieve,‚Äù and Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar estimated AMD's AI revenues would reach $10.2 billion by 2025. Most estimates are closer to $10 billion, and if AMD can achieve higher AI revenues in 2025, that would be a big boost to sentiment.



Two important factors in AMD's favor are flexibility and value. AMD offers more flexibility to hyperscalers who don't want to be tied to Nvidia's CUDA platform, which is considered a strong moat for the company, but which could also end up limiting customer choice. Another important factor is value; Nvidia's H100 costs four times as much as rival AMD chips. With hyperscalers ordering thousands of these chips, getting better value out of them is important to maintain your margins and gain a competitive edge.



AMD will increase sales of its MI325 and MI350 series in 2025. This will provide a strong boost to the company's AI revenue. If AMD's AI revenues approach $14 billion to $15 billion in 2025, we could see the stock provide very strong bullish momentum. The company has consistently outperformed both market expectations and its own forecasts for AI revenue, and AMD could outperform the market's general expectations in the AI space in 2025.



Rapid sales of AI chips will inevitably help boost AMD's margins and earnings per share in the coming quarters. The market generally expects AMD's earnings per share to grow 55 percent next year and another 38 percent in 2026. This would increase earnings per share for the fiscal year ending December 2026 to $7.05 per share. At that EPS, the expected price-to-earnings ratio is less than 17 times, which is very modest for one of the major AI players in the industry.

https://preview.redd.it/090ubc00oe9e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bee1ed70a0e9e89a304ac131221c9779acbb56b

  
AMD's revenues and operating income have turned an inflection point as the data center division has increased its share of revenues. Overall revenue grew from $5.8 billion a year ago to $6.8 billion in the most recent quarter, despite the poor performance of the Gaming and Embedded divisions. This is thanks to the Data Center division, which more than doubled its revenue to $3.5 billion in the most recent quarter compared to the same period last year.



https://preview.redd.it/88ohbid3oe9e1.png?width=1054&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba193efb51e209848836e45fd6423c8aca9404c5

Operating income was more heavily impacted by recent earnings, indicating a lucrative data center business.



AMD's AI division is facing a number of positives and is expected to beat market expectations in 2025. This could improve operating income and EPS trends in the coming quarters, making AMD stock a good choice at current prices.



AMD's strong and stable management has delivered better results over the past few years compared to Intel. Unlike Intel, which is trying to expand its expensive foundry business, AMD has also made better strategic decisions by focusing on its artificial intelligence business. Most analysts estimate that AMD's AI revenue in 2025 will be close to $10 billion. That number may be underestimated as the company accelerates development of its next-generation AI chips.



AMD offers flexibility and value to hyperscale organizations, which increases the appeal of its AI chips. Its price-to-earnings ratio is less than 17 times for the fiscal year ending December 2026, which is quite modest for a company that is growing earnings per share rapidly and is a core part of the AI industry.

2024-12-25,09:09:20,StockMarket,"What's Your Opinion On ""Too Many ETFs?""","I love ETFs and I attempt to diversify my portfolio with a variety of them. While I try to keep it simple, there are some ETFs that attract me for various reasons. Obviously, a low expense ratio is nice, and I focus on high AUM and long term records. But, assuming a variety of ""quality"" ETFs, there is an argument that ""too many is bad"" and I frankly can't understand the logic behind it.

The argument is that it can overexpose certain positions or dilute performance, but let's think about that. There are two situations: (Let's use simple numbers)

1. I invest $10,000 in ETF A which happens to have 10% allocation in NVDA among other things and 10% in ETF B which has 5% allocation in NVDA among other things. This gives me $20k of assets with 7.5% average exposure to NVDA.
2. I invest $20,000 in either ETF A or B. This gives me either 10% or 5% in NVDA. Obviously, the same holds true for the rest of the top holdings, you get the average.

So, I can't see what the argument against ""too many EFS"" is? If you're in A and the top holding does well, you've made more money. If you're in B, you've missed out on gains. If you're in both, you get the average. Sure, you may miss out on profits, but most of the quality ETFs have a lot of overlap anyways, so whether I invest it all in one or spread the allocation, I'm still getting in the same stocks at the top. At least by spreading it across multiple ETFs, I can get a chance to diversify more in the bottom 50 holdings.

So, what's your thoughts? Is this really an issue? Feedback on my current breakdown below?

\----

Currently, I have about 45% in VOO / VT / VTHR  
about 15% in 2 dividend ETFs

25% in QQQ

about 5% in one sector growth etf speculation

And about 5% spread across 8 other growth speculation ETFs

So, overall, I'm in 19 ETFs, but I'd say the bulk are in 4 core ETFs with a handful of others augmenting each category and then the others are diverse and classified by category, with only a small % going towards speculation and even those are diversified in various sectors.

The simple breakdown would be 45% S&P, 15% Dividend, 35% Growth (25 / 10 Spec), 3% individual stocks, and 2% emergency fund.

  
I should probably add that there are $0 trade fees and no annual account expenses or penalties beyond just the expense ratio of the ETF, all of which are mostly between 0.03 and 0.10 with a few exceptions and those exeptions make up a smaller weight of the portfolio. If anything, I'd argue that having more gives you more variety to buy different areas of your portfolio for dollar cost averaging when certain areas aren't doing as well. ",NVDA,NVIDIA

2024-12-24,15:32:27,StockMarket,Can Nvidia continue its rise?,"Morgan Stanley stated that Nvidia's Blackwell chip will be the company's biggest highlight in 2025, with the success of this next-generation GPU expected to overshadow any remaining investor concerns.

This week, the bank reiterated its ""Overweight"" rating on Nvidia's stock, stating that the chipmaker remains one of its top picks for 2025. The optimism is driven by expectations of the success of Blackwell‚ÄîNvidia's next-generation AI chip.

The bank set a target price of $166 per share, a 23% increase from Nvidia's price of approximately $134.82 as of last Friday.

""When short-term data is volatile but the fundamentals are very strong, we are most optimistic about Nvidia. We believe we are approaching that stage now,"" the analysts wrote in their report. ""Despite transitional pressures, by the second half of 2025, the only topic will be the strong performance of Blackwell.""

Investors are already optimistic about the Blackwell chip, which is expected to launch in early 2025. Earlier this year, Nvidia's stock surged after CEO Jensen Huang said the demand for the chip was ""crazy,"" boosting Wall Street's expectations for sustained profitability growth for Nvidia.

Morgan Stanley added that the chip could become the ""core driver of revenue"" in the second half of next year, suggesting ""significant upside potential"" for the stock price.

The success of the new chip could also alleviate some of the short-term to medium-term concerns investors have regarding Nvidia's stock.

Morgan Stanley pointed out that investors are primarily focused on four key issues:

**1. Slowing Production of Hopper Chips**

Investors are concerned about the slowdown in production of Nvidia's current generation AI chip, Hopper. In the latest earnings call, the company forecasted a 69.5% growth in revenue for the fourth quarter, the lowest in seven quarters.

However, Morgan Stanley stated that the slowdown in Hopper chip production is a ""non-issue.""

""The reason is simple: we are a few quarters away from the end of Hopper's lifecycle. We won't directly link Hopper production to revenue because Hopper's revenue will last for about three quarters. Additionally, there is a significant backlog of orders, so now is the time to slow down production,"" the analysts wrote.

**2. Different Versions of Blackwell Chips Not Shipping Simultaneously**

Investors may be concerned that not all Blackwell products will ship at the same time. Nvidia has stated that it will release seven different variants of the Blackwell GPU.

""We have heard concerns that some products may not be ready, and we do not deny that there may be timing challenges for some types of products,"" the analysts said.

They added, ""This is a reasonable concern, but all Blackwell chips will be sold, even if this results in distribution changes among customers. We expect this to continue for a whole year, and it should not be a long-term concern.""

Morgan Stanley stated that by the second half of 2025, concerns about the Blackwell launch will ""completely disappear.""

**3. Competitors Eroding Nvidia's Value**

The analysts noted that in recent months, part of Nvidia's market value has shifted to other chipmakers such as Broadcom and Marvell. These companies produce ASIC custom AI chips, which are alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs.

""But by 2025, we believe the largest users of ASICs will actually shift their purchases back to GPUs,"" said Morgan Stanley. ""While we are relatively conservative in our revenue forecasts for Broadcom and Marvell's ASICs, we believe GPUs will significantly outperform ASICs this year.""

**4. Reduced Chip Demand**

Large AI chip customers are expanding their GPU clusters for more advanced computing. However, some financial supporters question whether the return on investment is worth it, Morgan Stanley noted.

""Both of these aspects are important, and we cannot rule out the possibility of market consolidation in certain areas,"" the analysts said. ""But we note that many of Nvidia's recent innovations have aimed at improving the efficiency of large clusters,"" they added, pointing to Nvidia's acquisition of Mellanox, which will help expand its data center market share.

The analysts stated, ""Even with concerns about a cooling arms race in AGI, the growth in inference, sovereign training, and enterprise training applications are multi-year growth drivers, accounting for about 70% of data center revenue. Even if the arms race consolidates, we will still see sustained growth potential.""

Despite Nvidia's stock price having surged 170% in 2024, most analysts remain optimistic about Nvidia in 2025. The continued AI trade frenzy is expected to be one of the major themes influencing the stock market in 2025.

:--|:--:|--:
S&P 500 ETF (VOO) | $700 | 37.14%
NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) | $400 | 21.22%
MAG 6 (no Tesla) | $180 ($30 each) | 9.55%
Small Caps (AVUV) | $120 | 6.37%
Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) | $100 | 5.30%
Financial Sector ETFs (XLF and IAI) * | $80 ($40 each) | 4.244%
Semiconductors ETF (SMH) | $80 | 4.244%
Individual Stock Picks I like (15 in total, listed below) ** | $225 ($15 each) | 11.94%
**TOTAL** | $1885 | 100%

*The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc..., whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schwab, S&P Global etc... There is only a 15% overlap between these two ETFs.

**The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are: Adobe (ADBE), AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Chipotle (CMG), Salesforce (CRM), Door Dash (DASH), Netflix (NFLX), ServiceNow (NOW), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Palantir (PLTR), Shopify (SHOP), Sofi Bank (SOFI), Uber (UBER)

---

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

I'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).

2024-12-20,15:45:21,StockMarket,Can Tesla bounce back quickly,"Tesla stock has been on a recent surge, especially after Trump's victory, with shares soaring from $246.23 to $487, a gain of nearly 97%. This rise has been largely driven by politics, particularly Musk's relationship with Trump. But the question is, how long will this premium due to politics last?



Tesla's future is also closely tied to Fully Self-Driving (FSD). If FSD is successfully rolled out and receives regulatory approval, Tesla could transform into an online car company, which would be a steady source of cash flow. However, regulatory issues and technology rollout remain challenges.



Although Tesla's stock price has risen sharply, analysts have mixed views on its outlook. Barclays maintains a ‚ÄúNeutral‚Äù rating, believing that Tesla's stock price is out of touch with the company's fundamentals, with a price target of $270. CFRA, on the other hand, is more optimistic about Tesla, raising its price target to $560, believing that the elimination of the electric vehicle tax credit will help Tesla expand its market share.



Going forward, Tesla could be at risk of a stock price correction, but if FSD goes smoothly and there are no regulatory hurdles, Tesla's long-term outlook remains bullish.

Insider sales by top executives often lead to speculation about a company's financial health or outlook, potentially influencing stock prices.

Similarly, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Director Tench Coxe sold 1,000,000 shares of stock, a move that has raised eyebrows among shareholders.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen nine straight days, the longest string of losses since 1978. The 30-stock index is down 3.5% over that stretch. 

The index has been dragged down primarily by UnitedHealth, the insurer whose shares have been in a tailspin since the Dec. 4 shooting of executive Brian Thompson.

2024-12-18,08:50:26,StockMarket,NVIDIA's Recent Decline and Opportunities for a New Rally,"NVIDIA fell nearly 4% today before narrowing the loss to 1.22%. Since hitting a record closing high of $148.88 in early November, the AI chip maker's stock has dropped over 10%.

So, what is causing NVIDIA's decline?

**1. Supply Chain Issues and Challenges**

NVIDIA faces multiple challenges in its supply chain, a significant factor in its stock decline.

First, according to the latest data, the order volume and schedules for the GB200 and GB300 have been adjusted. Particularly, the mass production and shipment of GB series products have been postponed until after the Lunar New Year in February, increasing market uncertainty. Additionally, the small-scale production plans for GB300 face tight deadlines, putting pressure on GB200's mass production.

https://preview.redd.it/scpz7bjoak7e1.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c84a2bd55783d7b6efd0bfff35d9d3c4a3db74bb

Specific supply chain issues include CoWoS-L packaging technology, heating problems, copper cable connections, and leakage issues. These not only affect product yield rates but also increase system integration time costs. Consequently, NVIDIA has suggested customers purchase the B200 8-card HGX as a transitional solution, and clients like Microsoft are considering switching their orders. These supply chain issues affect NVIDIA's product delivery capabilities and reduce market expectations for its future performance.

**2. Market Competition and Narrative Changes**

ASICs are gaining market recognition as a competitive narrative.

ASICs are chips designed for specific tasks, akin to custom running shoes for a race. For certain tasks, ASICs outperform NVIDIA's GPUs (widely used for computing tasks) and are potentially cheaper.

OpenAI co-founder Ilya and industry leaders like Microsoft's CEO Satya have started discussing the importance of not only training AI models but also ensuring they can quickly and accurately make decisions in real applications. This shift in perspective gives ASICs an advantage in some scenarios, as they are designed for rapid, precise execution of tasks.

This raises questions about the cost of NVIDIA's GPUs. While powerful, they are expensive and require significant electricity and cooling. As ASICs perform better at lower costs for some tasks, there's consideration of replacing NVIDIA's GPUs with ASICs.

Additionally, changes in scaling law narratives and the strengthening of inference narratives pose threats to NVIDIA.

Scaling laws suggest that increasing AI model size (e.g., more neurons or layers) typically improves performance, but these gains are not infinite and require significant computational resources. This means NVIDIA must continually invest resources to improve product performance, potentially increasing costs.

https://preview.redd.it/pjjpyc10bk7e1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=20d52e676ae3473e567bb43fb383864886de72cb

Moreover, companies like BTC, Tesla, and Google are investing heavily in their own AI chips or solutions. This intensifies market competition and challenges NVIDIA's leadership.

**3. Market Sentiment and Capital Flows**

Market sentiment and capital flow significantly impact NVIDIA's stock price. As the year ends, retail investors, ETFs, and institutions adjust their portfolios. Fluctuations in tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Google affect tech stocks like NVIDIA. Investors are more cautious, favoring stable, promising companies.

Given these conditions, NVIDIA faces pressure on its stock price due to supply chain issues and competition. Lowered expectations for NVIDIA's future performance lead to capital outflows and stock price declines.

  
**4. Future Outlook and Catalysts**

Despite current challenges, NVIDIA has opportunities for a turnaround.

First, NVIDIA needs to resolve supply chain issues, improve product yield, and delivery capabilities. Second, strengthening its presence in software and applications is crucial to addressing market competition. Additionally, NVIDIA should explore new computing narratives to expand its computing potential.

 **5. Technical Analysis and Price Divergence**

Previously, prices rose continuously, but volume and KDJ began to decline, showing divergence. Without capital support, upward momentum was insufficient, leading to a short-term adjustment and a break below the mid-term trend line, resulting in a mid-term adjustment.

When Might a New Rally Occur?

From a technical analysis perspective: After two prior mid-term adjustments, breaking the downward trend line may signal the start of a new rally. Thus, this new rally must first break the resistance line.

From a catalyst perspective: While January's CES and the earnings release in late February may not bring major surprises, March's GTC is worth anticipating. NVIDIA needs to showcase new technologies and products at this event to restore market confidence. If NVIDIA can introduce groundbreaking innovations, a stock rebound is possible. ",NVDA,NVIDIA

2024-12-17,13:59:52,StockMarket,Which Quantum Stock to invest in? Avoid QUBT,"Following on from my¬†[recent DD ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hadjii/quantum_computing_inc_is_going_to_crash/)on Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT), a lot of messages and a 70% rise in share price that has cooked my puts, I decided I'd dive a bit deeper

# QUBT does not have leading quantum physicists or innovation.

[Monroe has more talent in his pinky](https://preview.redd.it/gk9l4glffb7e1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=645bae223cfaf7054b06f4fedcb50cb42b941647)

Similar to when evaluating biotechs, in the quantum computing industry you need to consider the academic and publishing background of employees. Quantum Computing is a pioneering area of science, innovations are typically borne out of research conducted by universities and research centres that are published and reviewed. As I explained in my past post, QUBT's staff did not attain their Phds at leading universities (something which is¬†**very important**¬†given the quantum computing academic field is relatively small and nascent). Furthermore, even if you thought they might be diamonds in the rough - their publication records indicate that they are abysmal researchers (see above). The citation count of QUBT's entire (quantum) employee count is unable to match the citation count of individual founders from competing firms. This is a clear indication that their 'innovations' and patents are likely to fail commercially.

# For every technical staff member at QUBT, there is $42million in market capitalisation.

[Bearish signal: Big capital raises and no hiring](https://preview.redd.it/fjc1l70jfb7e1.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e59911426fa5b04bad519efa0bfea459b1f221f)

Furthermore, even if I was agnostic on education and publishing background, just from a headcount perspective, they do not have the people. They are the smallest of the four leading small cap quantum firms. And despite capital raises, including a recent¬†[$50 million capital raise](https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/12/11/quantum-computing-inc-announces-50-million-from-stock-offerings-to-support-photonic-chip-foundry/)¬†and booming stock price, they have not shown signs of new hiring. The current market cap of $1.33 billion appears unsustainable, and works out to $42 million per technical staff member - that's more than my dad made in his entire life.

# Where has the money gone?

If you believe what the company is saying, the money from their recent capital raises are going into a foundry dedicated to processing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) chips for use in quantum computing.

There are a number of commercial lithium niobate suppliers, and unlike what they claim on their¬†[website](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/research-and-publications/thin-film-lithium-niobate-tfln), suppliers do exist in countries other than China - see¬†[Switzerland](https://lightium.com/),¬†[USA](https://www.samaterials.com/niobium-compounds/66-lithium-niobate-wafers.html),¬†[UK](https://gandh.com/products/crystal-optics/lithium-niobate-wafers). Given the relative obscurity of QUBT's employees, it is unlikely that they'll manage to either make functioning chips ([which they are already falling behind on](https://iceberg-research.com/2024/12/09/qubt-is-already-running-behind-with-its-new-chip-manufacturing-hype/)) or beat out their competitors who possess significantly more valuable patents, better manufacturing capability and greater commercial links (i.e. with Amazon, Nvidia, Google).

Also here is what Quantum Computing Inc‚Äôs foundry¬†[looks like](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/quantumcomputinginc_qci-foundry-plasmatherm-activity-7247977871216930816-MJtF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios), which notably¬†[Iceberg Research](https://iceberg-research.com/2024/11/27/quantum-computing-inc-the-phantom-chip-foundry/)¬†exposed them for lying about its size.

# But would QUBT really mislead investors?

QUBT has pivoted many times during its history: from¬†[beverage company](https://iceberg-research.com/2022/10/05/quantum-computing-inc-qubt-on-its-way-to-vacuum-state/), to quantum software, artificial intelligence, and now quantum chips.

2024-12-16,18:58:12,StockMarket,New Opportunities with Broadcom ASIC,"Broadcom trillion dollar market capitalization, in addition to the good performance, the most important thing is to give a very high expectation, 2027 AI revenue 60-90 billion dollars, only counting the existing 3 major customers can get the revenue opportunity. This is much higher than market expectations, meaning that from this year to 2027, AI revenue (AISC + network) almost doubled every year.

Weekend a lot of people ask ASIC ai questions I discussed with a friend: say a simple example of it GPU all things can be processed, but the efficiency of the specific computing is not high, ASIC is like to give a specific task tailored to the ‚Äúsuper staff‚Äù, only focus on doing one thing, but do it fast and good; and the GPU is versatile and multi-talented team of polymaths;

An ASIC, because it is customized, may be more efficient than a GPU at its specific task, but a GPU is more versatile. It's as if a ‚Äúsuper employee‚Äù is unrivaled in the specific tasks he or she is good at, but a ‚Äúversatile team‚Äù can handle a wide variety of tasks, and although it may be a little less efficient in a single specific task, it is more versatile in its overall capabilities, and is able to adapt to a wide range of complex and changing computing scenarios

Net data processing, customize an asic chip maybe only a few dollars, buy a cpu the cheapest also need a few hundred, gpu similar to cpu all parallel operations can run, but asic made npu can only run specific algorithms. When the model is given (NIC chips that only run network processing) it's definitely cheaper for asic. Starting next year tech giants customize their chips and these reduced capex can be directly converted to net profits

So that's why NVDA is down today, this will suck the liquidity out of other stocks! Broadcom will be embraced by the world!",NVDA,NVIDIA

2024-12-13,22:56:24,StockMarket,AAPL taking a breather,"# üìä AAPL Technical Breakdown and Small Account Challenge

I‚Äôve been analyzing **Apple's (AAPL)** charts, and here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeing:

1. **Technical Indicators:**
   * Upward trend **broke below and retested** before showing signs of heading lower.
   * **Bearish death candle** on the daily chart.
   * A **Head and Shoulders** pattern on the 1-hour chart.
2. **Indicators:**
   * **RSI** is signaling **overbought** conditions.
3. **Fundamentals:**
   * The **PE ratio** is significantly **above its 10-year average**.

It needs a breather after the recent rocket run it's had from $219 to $250 in 25 days. That's a **12% increase** in **market cap in 25 days?!** How does that make sense?

Given this, I‚Äôm predicting a pullback to **$244** before a bounce or further direction. Current price: **$248**.

# üìù How I‚Äôm Trading This:

I‚Äôm in a **spread trade** to maximize safety and minimize cost:

* **Sell $245 strike** and **buy $247.50 strike** as insurance.

This spread costs **$86** in risk for a potential **$164 profit** if AAPL dips below $245 by expiration. With these indicators lining up, it‚Äôs a **solid risk/reward** play.  
  
I‚Äôm documenting this in my **Small Account Challenge**: taking my account from **$500 to $1,000,000**. üìà

2024-12-12,03:09:50,StockMarket,Trying to justify puts ,"Ok, call me crazy but TSLA valuation isn‚Äôt making sense. My rationale is kind of easy, I see more Rivian SUVs and truck around me than Cybertruck and it‚Äôs been a long long time since anybody I know bought a Tesla car/SUV. 


Robotaxi - China is way ahead of the States when it comes to Robotaxi and I feel Waymo already has the first movers advantage 

Model Q - it‚Äôs at least 3-4 years away, Tesla doesn‚Äôt have the turn around time that Chinese companies have 


Chinese EVs - while they won‚Äôt be allowed in USA but they have made their point, they are cheaper, equally good and in some cases better - Tesla has limited international growth potential now. Like I hear in India people are paying over 100% in tariffs to buy BYD from Singapore - they say it‚Äôs still good value for money

Elon will have to make some tall promises (again) in the next earnings call to justify this valuation - because he‚Äôs not selling as many cars and Robotaxi or model Q are still a distant future. ",TSLA,Tesla

Intel seems like a company that's really struggling right now. Their stock just dropped to around $20.16, and it‚Äôs not just the GPU market giving them trouble. They‚Äôre battling issues on multiple fronts.

First off, their foundry business (where they manufacture chips) is bleeding money ‚Äì about $7 billion in annual losses! They‚Äôre not expected to break even there until at least 2027. On top of that, they‚Äôre losing market share to AMD and Nvidia, both in CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia is dominating with AI, and AMD is taking more and more of the gaming market.

It also feels like they completely missed the whole AI boom. Nvidia is raking in insane profits, while Intel seems to be‚Ä¶ just watching? And to make things worse, their CEO recently stepped down, which makes their future even more uncertain.

That said, they‚Äôve just launched their new Arc B580 and B570 budget GPUs. Nvidia and AMD seem more focused on AI and data centers right now, so maybe Intel has a shot at carving out a space in gaming? But is that really enough to turn things around?

2024-12-09,16:46:43,StockMarket,QUBT is about to crash hard,"Context: Quantum computing is having its moment. It‚Äôs risky, but could massively disrupt industries in areas like computing, finance and cyber security. But stock market bubbles are forming. 

Quantum computing is probably the most technically difficult industry for analysts to assess. Few people are equipped with an adequate understanding of quantum technologies, which is leading to massive mispricing. 

QUBT is junk

Quantum Computing Inc. has many problems. Iceberg Research‚Äôs recent short report covers some of them. They note that the firm has run from one fad to another (chips, ai, computing) and failed at each. They list several misleading claims that QUBT has made and withdrawn. The report is damning and raises serious questions about the future of the company, I encourage you all to read it. 

However Iceberg does not go far enough.

https://iceberg-research.com/2024/11/27/quantum-computing-inc-the-phantom-chip-foundry/

QUBT lacks talent. Successful quantum innovations requires strong technical knowledge that you really can only come by in either leading universities or megacap firms like google. 

I went through the Linkedin profiles of each of QUBT‚Äôs employees and compared them with their small cap competitors. I tallied up the share of employees that went to an Edu Rank top-100 world universities for Quantum Physics (which is a very broad net), QUBT ranks incredibly poorly among it‚Äôs peers - less than a fifth of employees (see picture)*. This is robust to different ranking metrics. Counting only Ivy leagues QUBT comes out much worse.

But look, not all employees are on linkedin. Maybe QUBT is the next big underdog? No. 

A large share of QUBT‚Äôs ‚Äútalent‚Äù comes from the Steven‚Äôs Institute of Technology, an unremarkable university in New Jersey (ranked 150+ for Quantum Physics depending on list) 

The company‚Äôs Chief Quantum Officer is Yuping Huang. On first glance he appears to have a prolific publishing history; however, most papers receive low citations and/or he is third, fourth or fifth author. Huang was previously sued by shareholders for breaching fiduciary duties when he merged his previous company QPhoton with QUBT. Notably he is both a QUBT director and employee, which is a big corporate governance redflag (reminds me of $SAVA). 

There is only one independent director with a background in Quantum Physics to provide checks and balance on Huang ‚Äî Dr Javad Shabani. He is not up to the task. His publishing history is mediocre. 

Looking deeper, the Chief Technology Officer Yong Meng Sua, has an even more mediocre publishing history. And has only risen to an Assistant Professor role at Steven‚Äôs. He spends much of his time discussing esoteric computing questions tangential to his work (i.e. the NP=P problem, see their LinkedIn posts)

And finally the Director of the Company‚Äôs chip foundry (Iceberg has raised significant questions about the foundry). Dr Milan Begliarbekov after finishing high school enrolled in a bachelor‚Äôs degree in English literature at Steven‚Äôs, graduated, then immediately enrolled in a physics Phd at Steven‚Äôs. Either he is a savant polymath who is able to pick up grad school physics level math, or a Phd from Steven‚Äôs is worthless. His publishing career is very mediocre. 

These scientists will not crack the major problems stopping widespread commercialization of Quantum tech. Simply compare their publishing records to the founder at Ion-Q (Peter Chapman) or leading quantum scientists at Google, alongside the significant and verifiable technological advancements these companies have made. 

Another clue that something is amiss is headcount. Rigetti has three fold the number of employees as QUBT. QBTS has six fold. All have similar market cap. What‚Äôs driving value? We‚Äôve established that it‚Äôs not human capital. Iceberg‚Äôs research reveals it‚Äôs not intellectual property or physical capital either. 

So why has it done so well? QUBT‚Äôs high valuation is driven by regarded retail investors.

Only 3.3% of QUBT is held by institutional investors (and falling). Compared with ~40% for IONQ, ~30% for RGTI and ~47% for QBTS. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qubt/institutional-holdings

The lack of institutional investment in QUBT while institutional investors are simultaneously clamouring to load up on quantum stocks is a massive red flag that something is up with QUBT. In fact no Wall Street analysts track QUBT. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/quantum-computing-qubt-stock-skyrockets-short-sellers-are-lurking

So what happens next? 

QUBT‚Äôs 800% rise in one month is going to attract short selling interest as people realise it‚Äôs junk. The stock will fall back below $1. 

Risk:
If you want to short/buy puts, You can rest assured that the company is not going to suddenly become profitable. The main risk comes from why QUBT has done so well, despite having little revenue, expertise, or innovation to show for it.

QUBT is literally called Quantum Computing Incorporated. If you‚Äôre a full regard wanting to invest in Quantum computing are you going to invest in IonQ (what?), Rigetti (spaghetti company?) or a company conveniently called Quantum Computing? It‚Äôs a regard trap. 

It‚Äôs like being interested in electric cars and passing on Tesla because you wanted to invest in a stock called Electric Car Co. 

My positions

1000 put contracts to sell @$4.50, cost average = 0.11, expiring Dec 20. If this doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôm going to buy puts again and again. This company sucks. 

I‚Äôm long IonQ and after doing this DD I will probably also buy Rigetti in the near future.

2024-12-06,17:51:07,StockMarket,What would you consider a good entry point for bitcoin?,"Bitcoin recently hit a value of $100k, as I‚Äôm sure we are all aware by now.

Arguably, bitcoin has been one of the most successful investments over the last 10 years, up there with NVDA and other Mag 7 stocks.

I won‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôve been a Bitcoin hater for most of my investing career. It‚Äôs tough to conceptualize fully, it has not always been mainstream enough so it‚Äôs understandable to be leery of it, and its supporters are so ardent and ravenous that it feels like a cult. I don‚Äôt blame any skeptics for not putting their money into it.

That said, over the last year or two, it has certainly gained a ton of legitimacy as it has played a significant role in Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign and also begun to be an asset that hedge funds are also purchasing.

I, like many others I assume, want to make it a part of my portfolio, but it‚Äôs tough to analyze its value because it doesn‚Äôt act like your usually security exchanged on the stock market. There are no balance sheets or income statements for bitcoin to look at, and I have no idea if its valuation is way too high or too low.

I can certainly see it continuing to go up in the near to mid term future. If you told me it would hit $200k in the next two years, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. That said, I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it also hit $40k in the next two years too.

Is now a good time to buy? There‚Äôs a lot of hype around it after it just hit $100k in value, so I‚Äôm nervous about jumping into it right now, but I‚Äôm struggling to put together a fair value estimate that I should wait for it to hit before I buy.

2024-11-26,10:14:31,StockMarket,"AI Spending Isn‚Äôt Slowing Down, the Mag 7 Stocks Are Still the Best Bet","Microsoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet, aren't going to stop pouring billions into chatbots.  



Although Nvidia saw a dip due to high market expectations, the long-term outlook for AI remains strong, with chip sales still showing impressive growth. While there‚Äôs competition from AMD, the overall demand for AI chips is skyrocketing.  



The Mag 7 remains the key growth driver for AI. Analysts predict these companies will keep growing, with capital spending expected to surge by double digits, reaching nearly $300 billion by 2027 (according to FactSet). Nvidia benefits from chip demand, while Meta drives revenue through advertising.



And even though the Mag 7 has outperformed the market (twice the S&P 500's gains), their valuations are still reasonable‚Äîaround 27 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, down from over 30 times earlier this year, and near the middle of their historical range (according to Evercore).  



So, in short, keep holding on! ",NVDA,NVIDIA

2024-11-23,20:17:48,StockMarket,Most Valuable Lessons I learned from stock market.,"1. DCA
2. Don‚Äôt pick shit stocks stick with the best names.
3. Don‚Äôt play options, ever.
4. Diversify. Everyone and their own way of doing this. Find which way works best for you.  
5. Don‚Äôt think about getting rich overnight, it takes years of DCA and scaling into a bigger portfolio and also where you will see best results(5-10+ years)
6. Always focus on maxing Roth IRA before brokerage. 
7. Why settle for the 2nd best when you can buy the best?(example; NVDA consistently outperformed AMD)
8. You should have less than 30(I have less than 10) stocks overall. You don‚Äôt want 300 stocks worth a few dollars, when you can have 10 or 30 worth a few thousand.

2024-11-20,22:28:07,StockMarket,I‚Äôve been covering $NVDA since 2011 when it was worth just $0.35 per share (post-split adjusted that is). AMA about its latest earnings report. ,"**Update: Looks like we ran into sitewide issue right when things got started, I'll be back at noon ET to try this again!**   
  
Hi! I‚Äôm Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I‚Äôve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022.

I‚Äôve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since.

Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia‚Äôs AI efforts, from reporting on how they‚Äôre dealing with¬†[the threat of increased competition](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-rivals-are-circling-but-theyre-still-years-from-catching-up-211621835.html)¬†to¬†[attending the company‚Äôs GTC conference](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-debuts-next-generation-blackwell-ai-chip-at-gtc-2024-205825161.html)¬†to chatting with¬†[CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/demand-is-just-so-strong-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-tells-yahoo-finance-supply-cant-keep-up-012653951.html).

With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia‚Äôs chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like¬†[AMD are gaining steam](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-debuts-latest-ai-chips-as-it-battles-rivals-nvidia-intel-180032426.html), and Nvidia‚Äôs own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant.

How that plays out over the next few years is anyone‚Äôs guess.

In today‚Äôs fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips.

üíµ Revenue: $35.08B vs  $33.2B expected  
üí≤ Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected  
üíæ Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected

Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion.

I‚Äôll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia‚Äôs latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here.

2024-11-16,02:51:11,StockMarket,Some positive re-encouragement needed feels like I've got (fomo) ,"With stocks ripping to new highs. BTC on the brink of 100K I just feel like threw an opportunity to be financially free. 

I've trying to plan moves but don't know if it's even worth it at this point. It everything keeps on ripping I'm just gunna feel devastated losing positions I shouldn't have traded out of. 

But then if I reinvest. I'm probably subjecting myself to a possible downside of a crash and considering how high major stocks are such as $Tesla $Btc, $Mstr, $Hood  just to name a few. I just don't know what the play is anymore. I'm at a total loss mindset. 

Btc is too far gone for me to make any real worthwhile profit. I dont have the surplus amount in capital or savings to enjoy making a trade. The ""what goes up must come down looms"" 

I had a plan but now I'm just dragging along. In the hopes of some black Swan event. 

The whole world is apparently going through an economic crisis from America to Europe and everything in between. 

What's peoples thoughts currently on the markets in general. ",TSLA,Tesla
2024-11-15,13:54:11,StockMarket,It's 287 a reasonable stop-loss for TSLA?,"I bought 3 stocks of TSLA at 330 knowing that I was willing to lose up to 130-ish dollars, and wanted to make 130-ish dollars. The reason being: I'm moving to Japan on December 29th and was considering travelling somewhere for two days for New Year's and maybe being frugal with my cash and choice of hotel or something. My logic being: if I don't make bank on this bet, I'll just celebrate in Tokyo and save 140 dollars on stupid expenses, no big deal. 

The recent announcement to cut EV incentives scared me and I set a stop-loss at 287. However, I've got a bit of FOMO knowing it could bounce back after that. But my intuition says it's more likely to crash if it reaches that point.

I could also just sell now and take the losses, fuck it. Thoughts?",TSLA,Tesla
2024-11-13,16:32:05,StockMarket,RKLB,"I've been buying RKLB since it was worth around 11 dollars. I currently have around 500 dollars of RKLB and 600 dollars of VOO in my portfolio. Is it worth getting RKLB and selling VOO? I believe RKLB has loads of potential and that the stock will shoot up as soon as they get a successful Neutron launch out of the way. Also, despite what some are fearing, I doubt Elon would interfere in RKLB's business. Neutron is not a F9 competitor for now and until they can get their cadence up, it won't even be. A Trump presidency does not seem like that much of a risk. Especially with Elon fighting for things like deregulation, which will help everyone including RKLB. I do understand going all in on a single company stock like RKLB is very risky, but if things do pan out, this will be like buying Tesla in the early 2010s. Space is the new market and RKLB is right behind SpaceX in it. I'm 15 so I have a long investment horizon.",TSLA,Tesla

* **AMD** \- Lot of people are looking at AMD. It had a bullish last week but I believe it still has some more room below before rallying.
* **SOFI** \- Nice weekly breakout. Do not chase and wait for retest. The key level to retest is at 11/12 range.
* **NVDA** \- Three weeks ago Nvidia had weekly breakout and then it retested those levels before continuation to the upside last week. I had given target of $154 last month and I believe it will hit that target.",AAPL,Apple
2024-11-11,06:11:25,StockMarket,I'm extremely bullish on TSLA. ,"I just had hand surgery so I'm writing this one-handed, but during my recovery I did nothing but look at TSLA charts. I've never been a big believer of technical analysis and I know some people ride and die for support levels but honestly I find it can be quite distracting and not very useful. In this case, however, we can notice a pattern of bag holders who have FOMO'd into something they've wanted to sell for a quick buck and then had to bear the pain sometimes for years. A good deal of those sold at a loss at some point but TSLA's Market Cap is still made up in some part of people in the red. These people have been waiting to cash in for years and at this point they're not gonna sell unless it at least hits a historic high. So I do believe that a price of $400 is, at least for now, an important support level for this stock, and if I know the dude-bro culture that is largely responsible of this rally, I'd actually say $420 is an ever more reasonable price within the next 2 months.

2024-11-06,23:56:55,StockMarket,RIVN and other EV makers: How will Trump-Musk dynamics affect the market?,"We all know Musk and Trump have a ""special relationship,"" and with Trump returning to office, I can't help but wonder how this might affect other EV manufacturers, especially Rivian.

On the positive side, Volkswagen's investment in RIVN seems solid, and it looks like exactly the kind of European business involvement Trump wants to see in the US market. But here's what's bugging me - could Musk's influence on Trump's policies create an uneven playing field for emerging EV brands?

Some points to consider:
- Rivian's growing production numbers and improving margins
- VW's commitment to the US market through RIVN
- Tesla's dominant position and Musk's political connections
- Potential policy changes affecting EV subsidies

Being the single largest donor to Trump's campaign is working out for Elon (and me).

What surprised me, though, is seeing other stocks like Coca-Cola (KO) and some REITs reacting negatively, dropping by about -4%. It makes me wonder why certain sectors seem to be moving in the opposite direction. 

It looks like today‚Äôs heatmap is showing a clear trend: sectors like consumer non-durables and health tech took a noticeable hit, while finance and tech stocks are up. Interesting to see how varied the reactions are across sectors‚Äîmaybe it‚Äôs tied to post-election sentiments or a shift in investor focus? Anyone else noticing similar patterns in their portfolio?

2024-11-06,14:45:52,StockMarket,"Trump Election, How to Play","Stocks to be bullish on during a Trump term:

Oil: $XOP, $XOM, $SHEL, $MRO

C*****: $COIN, $MARA, $WULF

Big Bois - Apple: $MSFT, $NVDA, $AMZN etc

Military: $BA, $LMT, $RTX

Prison: CoreCivic ($CXW)

Sectors to be bearish on during a Trump term:

All renewable energy (except maybe nuclear)

Agriculture: immigrants make up significant amount of (cheap) labor for the sector

International shipping: tariffs and isolationist policy would be bad

Auto-manufacturing: parts coming from overseas will have tariffs

Low cost foreign retail like Shein and Temu equivalents will get hit hard by tariffs

‚ö†Ô∏èIncreased Volatility: Awaiting Action‚ö†Ô∏è

Cannabis: Republicans have historically been tough on marijuana. It seemed like things would be par for the course once again until Trump said on Truth Social that he would be voting in favor of Amendment 3 in Florida which would make it completely legal for adults 21 and up. I suspect this was a grift, but he‚Äôs such a wildcard that maybe he really would go against the conservative grain.

$APPL: While I left it out of the Big Bois due to the China taxes being a bearish variable, I think it should still hold strong in the long term.  We‚Äôll see

$TSM probably has the widest range of outcomes in the market imo. 
If Trump‚Äôs attitude toward China is legit-

Best Pro: $TSM sees increased demand from U.S. and allies who want to bypass China‚Äôs questionable supply chain.

Worst Con: $TSM still makes most of their money from China, who could retaliate in a number of ways

Least worst con: $TSM is still intertwined with China‚Äôs cheaper supply chain. A western supply chain would be more expensive and be time consuming to adopt.

Don‚Äôt even want to consider it possible, but anything less diplomatic than economic warfare with China would be drastic not only for $TSM but for the people of Taiwan, god forbid.

2024-11-06,13:57:20,StockMarket,Why Donald Trump‚Äôs Return Could Boost Demand for Robots ‚Äì A Long-Term Investment Opportunity,"Hey everyone,

With Donald Trump making a return, I think there‚Äôs more to consider than just the political drama. Specifically, his policies could have a huge ripple effect on the labor market, especially in the service industry. Trump‚Äôs stance on illegal immigration means we could see a stronger push to reduce undocumented workers, which would lead to an even bigger labor shortage in industries like hospitality, food service, and logistics. If fewer workers are available, companies will likely have to fill that gap‚Äîand robots could be the answer.

That‚Äôs where robotics companies come in, especially ones like Tesla, Richtech Robotics (RR), and Serve Robotics. Tesla is aiming to make waves with its humanoid robots, while Serve Robotics focuses on last-mile delivery solutions in urban areas. But let‚Äôs talk about Richtech Robotics (RR) in particular because they‚Äôve already got robots deployed and working in real-world environments, addressing exactly the kind of labor shortages we‚Äôre talking about. RR‚Äôs service robots are already in use across various industries, from restaurants to healthcare facilities, and they‚Äôre receiving high praise from clients for their reliability and efficiency. Their tech isn‚Äôt just conceptual‚Äîit‚Äôs been tested and proven, which gives them a solid foothold as demand grows.

And then there‚Äôs Elon Musk himself. If he ends up being involved in government restructuring, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see him push for more automation within federal jobs too, given his passion for robotics and AI. If Musk advocates for more robots in both private and public sectors, we could see a huge surge in the robotics industry overall.

Sure, the attention is still on DJT stocks and virtual currency as short-term plays riding the Trump wave, but I see robotics as a sector with way more potential for sustainable growth. For those of us looking for long-term positions, robots could be the steady play we‚Äôre after, especially as the tech gets better and companies like RR, SERV continue proving their value in real-world applications.

Anyone else seeing this as a big moment to get into robotics stocks for the long haul?",TSLA,Tesla
2024-11-05,04:11:24,StockMarket,Educate me about stock ,"So, what happens to your stock when a company is split/broken up?

It looks to me like its best to sell before the break up is announced, definitely before the split, but maybe I'm wrong?   
It's assets are shrinking, right? its net worth should be split... no? 

Ugh, there's a character limit.   
I'll fill that with a story. So I've followed stock loosely over the years... some of the best deals I've seen were almost always Elon musk deals. I was actually there for the solar city merger... sadly didn't have seed money. I knew it was going to be an excellent deal but couldn't capitulate.   
also was there at the twitter purchased, where they locked in at a higher price than the stock was when he purchased. can you imagine? Grabbing tesla stock at 25 dollars a stock? it was an incredible deal.   
  
so you could have purchased it and then picked up a 10 dollar earning per stock... easy peasy. Elon has always been good money so far. 

I also was there when the game stop thing happen, again no seed money... and doge... and I also called it when it was time to sell gamestop (yes, I know, everyone was screaming hold to hold because screw wall street... but us hustlers were pushing the line for the hold bros, so you can hate it but it helped the cause. moot point, I was on the call but didnt have any action behind it). 

I finally have money to seed some trades, trying to keep an eye out for the next thing now. ",TSLA,Tesla

2024-10-28,18:26:25,StockMarket,MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments.
While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36.
Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%.
MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds
One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance.
Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ‚ñº and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities.
There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft‚Äôs heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",NVDA,NVIDIA

A significant contributor to Tesla's profitability came from $739 million in regulatory credits, which the company earns for producing only electric vehicles. These credits, essentially pure profit, helped bolster Tesla‚Äôs bottom line. Additionally, Tesla hit a milestone with 7 million vehicles produced and reported that its Cybertruck achieved a positive gross margin for the first time, despite quality challenges.

Looking ahead, Tesla expects modest growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024, even as it faces increasing competition, particularly from Chinese automakers and U.S. legacy brands ramping up their electric vehicle efforts. Some investors are also raising concerns over CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs political activities, questioning how it could influence Tesla's brand and stock performance amidst a highly competitive landscape. Despite these challenges, Tesla remains committed to launching more affordable models by 2025.

2024-10-21,18:00:28,StockMarket,Thoughts on GOOGLanalysis,"# Why I'm ALL-IN on GOOGLE.

**Potential Antitrust Breakup (I love this!)**

I anticipate an antitrust breakup could unlock even greater value for Google. If this happens, owning the company before the breakup means we would receive shares of each separated business unit, which will most def drive a higher valuation.

**Waymo, Waymo Waymo**

Google‚Äôs self-driving division, Waymo, is making significant strides. They recently announced they will be committing $5 billion to the unit over a multi-year period.

**A**. Waymo is already operating in San Francisco, Phoenix, and soon to be Los Angeles, it's safe to say they cracked autonomous driving.

**B**. Critics argue that Tesla can scale better and that Waymo's cars are too expensive. To that, I disagree. Even if each Waymo vehicle costs $100k, plus another $100k for ALL associated expenses (fleet distribution, compute power, maintenance, talent, etc.), that still buys you 5,000 vehicles (assuming a 1-billion allocation of their stated investment), if each vehicle completes 15 rides per day, that‚Äôs over 26 million rides annually.

**C**. These rides not only generate revenue but also valuable data for future improvements.

**D**. This creates a significant competitive moat for Google, reinforcing its long-term dominance. The recognised moat is when the stock soars!

**Isomorphic Labs and AlphaFold-3**

Google's business unit Isomorphic Labs, and AlphaFold, are making rapid breakthroughs in drug discovery and forming partnerships across the pharmaceutical industry. With a potential antitrust breakup, this unit could thrive as a standalone company and attract substantial public investment, positioning itself as a legitimate pharmaceutical/AI powerhouse.

**Overall AI Expertise**

While Google‚Äôs search business is under threat, it‚Äôs important to recognize their AI prowess. Google is integrating AI across all their platforms, I think they'll retain a significant share of the search market over the long term. Their AI capabilities are vastly underappreciated.

**Android**

Android is an enormous business that could benefit from a spinoff. As a standalone company, Android could unlock significant value.

I feel it's time to back up the dump truck and LOAD UP.

2025-01-27,23:15:55,investing,The irony of the NVDA drop and reaction is ironic when you consider that it already happened before.,"Let me tell you a story...¬† It will have a point and I will give my investment ideas, but I need to establish the context first.

I used to be in the Tech Industry. For all intensive purposes I retired about a decade ago. My claim to fame was being speaker, trainer and consultant using Web technologies. Yes the original Web, which I started developing for in 95.¬†

I was just starting to work out of University as an IT consultant for UBS then SBG. My boss was tasked with figuring out this WWW thingy for the bank. I was there and thought, this is cool. As I dug into Netscape and Java (with a big J) I learned that this Web stuff could be really cool. I created in 96 a stock trading application using Microsoft OLE technologies embedded into Netscape with an Apache CGI backend. This was presented at a Swiss IEEE Data Highway conference (go ahead and check if you don't believe). I bought a Sun pizza box had a dedicated Internet connection in my apartment and wrote server extensions for Apache using the new CGI technology.

I am explaining the background because it allowed me to speak about Web and Java development in Silicon Valley at SD Conferences. I also attended the one and only Netscape developers conference. I was tasked by my boss to meet up with the Netscape folks to talk about making a browser deal with UBS. Here is where things became interesting.

As I was sitting in the imprunto meeting with Netscape I sensed they did not give a rats ass that UBS wanted 25,000 licenses of Netscape. The guy said, ""yeah we don't really want to deal with you because Deutsche Telekom wants a million licenses"".¬† I was a bit shocked and then indicated to them that I will take that information back to UBS. I also at the time asked about the Netscape Browser and the OLE interface. They said, ""yeah ignore that its Microsoft technologies and they are old school, you should learn Java and focus on that."" As I listened to the various sessions and the conceit I thought yeah this was the peak, everything will go downhill from here. 

I was convinced by that because as I was speaking at the various conferences in Silicon Valley I noticed a pattern. Silicon Valley people are arrogant as hell and they like to circle jerk each other. Meaning if you are not part of Silicon Valley you are nothing. For only the best work in Silicon Valley at least in their minds. 

Ok so now lets into the current situation and what I think will happen. Sun, Netscape and so on lost the thread when they focused on high end combining it with their arrogance. Sun boxes and Netscape were extremely expensive. They lost to Apache, PHP, and MySQL. They lost to an open source guy called Linus Torvals who was hacking out in Finnland!

The irony that a Chinese developer sitting in China has done a Linux is absolutely hilarious. When I see the Techbros and their financiers like Marc Andressen losing AGAIN you just have to chuckle. Remember Andressen was the loser in Netscape. 

But all is not lost because now the fun begins. When the dot com world collapsed onto itself we began to develop real web applications. Microsoft which was ignored by Netscape, released something called XMLHttpRequest object which made the Web of today possible. Those were the real glory days of Web after the dot com collapse.

So what does that mean for investing? Simple, essentially the entire dot com leaders collapsed and do not exist anymore. The exception being CSCO, but it was a long and hard road. What came out we didn't know at the time. However we do know the companies that thrived were the ones who used the WWW technology to offer a product. Think mapping, think social media, think google mail.

My main play would be ARM as they provide hardware that is cheap, efficient and could be scaled. Intel was not immediately as good as SPARC, but the Linux folks fixed that. I also think you need to look at companies that use AI to deliver a product. I am not talking about a chat bot. I am thinking something that offers a service to the retail that is something you want. And no I am not talking about Microsoft and its code pilot. I think it would be a mobile player. I am even thinking it could be somebody that has augmented glasswear stuff. You wear some glasses and have AI giving you information based on your actions.

I am not arguing that DeepSeek will win. On the contrary who knows if they will win, and it does not matter. What matters is that DeepSeek showed that the Silicon Valley argument of more hardware, more billions and more energy is pure and utter BS! A Chinese Open Source Developer proved that. There will be others that will do the exact same because we know we can. That is what should make Silicon Valley absolutely petrified and make you step away from the leaders with a ten foot pole.",NVDA,NVIDIA
2025-01-27,22:53:19,investing,The Market Is Dropping After Huge AI Breakthrough‚ÄîBut Isn‚Äôt This Great News?,"Today, news broke about a revolutionary AI model that‚Äôs open-source, extremely powerful, and developed with far fewer resources than ever before. This should be cause for celebration‚Äîit‚Äôs a major step forward for global productivity. Yet, the stock market is responding with a significant sell-off.

Tech-heavy companies like NVIDIA and TSMC are seeing double-digit drops (around 17%), and the broader tech sector is down \~5%. For those of us holding global index funds, this means a drop in value, as these companies carry significant weight. But here‚Äôs the puzzling part: shouldn‚Äôt this kind of breakthrough *increase* the long-term value of the total market?

Cheaper and more accessible AI means businesses across every sector can improve their efficiency, cut costs, and innovate faster. From logistics and manufacturing to healthcare and finance, the potential productivity boost is enormous. This isn‚Äôt bad news‚Äîit‚Äôs a massive opportunity for non-tech companies to thrive.

Yet, the market seems fixated on the short-term impact to companies that *develop* AI or produce the hardware for it. It‚Äôs as if the market is missing the forest for the trees. Why should the total value of all publicly traded companies *fall* on the news of a breakthrough that‚Äôs bound to make them more productive and profitable?

This feels like a moment where the market hasn‚Äôt fully priced in the reality of what this could mean. In the long run, wouldn‚Äôt a global index fund naturally benefit as this technology drives economic growth across industries?

So here‚Äôs my question to the community:

* Is the market too focused on the immediate losers (like NVIDIA or TSMC) while ignoring the broader winners?
* How can investors position themselves to reflect the long-term productivity gains from this development?
* Are there sectors, regions, or funds that might capture this shift better than a traditional global index fund?",NVDA,NVIDIA
2025-01-27,22:39:06,investing,I believe Nvidia's sell-off is justified‚ÄîI think they have lost their MOAT.,"A large part of Nvidia‚Äôs stock price is tied to the perception that their latest and greatest chips are the only way to achieve the best AI models. However, DeepSeek has proven that this is not the case‚Äîstate-of-the-art models can be developed using older chips. Granted, they still used Nvidia chips, but this fundamentally shifts the equation.

This means Nvidia has lost its pricing power. If they price their latest chips too high, customers now have the option to simply use older chips or even switch to AMD‚Äôs alternatives.

Effectively, this erodes Nvidia‚Äôs competitive advantage and commoditizes their chips.

I agree that AI developers largely use CUDA, and Nvidia's ecosystem is still vast, but... DeepSeek‚Äôs model development costs are **27x cheaper** than the latest models developed by American companies. DeepSeek‚Äôs subscription costs **$0.50** compared to ChatGPT‚Äôs **$20** subscription. Granted, it‚Äôs a Chinese company, and there are valid security concerns, but they have published all their research openly‚Äîmeaning any other company can leverage this research to build models at a lower cost.

Unless someone can definitively prove that Nvidia‚Äôs latest and greatest chips are absolutely necessary for developing the best AI models **and** that those best models will provide meaningful value to end customers, I don‚Äôt see how Nvidia can maintain its edge.",NVDA,NVIDIA

2025-01-27,18:44:35,investing,Markets are Overreacting to DeepSeek,"The markets are overreacting to the DeepSeek news. 

Nvidia and big tech stocks losing a trillion dollars in value is not realistic. 

I personally am buying more NVDA stock off the dip. 

So what is going on?

The reason for the drop:  Investors think DeepSeek threatens to disrupt the US big tech dominance by enabling smaller companies and cost-sensitive enterprises with an open source and low cost, high performance model. 

Here is why I think fears are overblown.

1. Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and other big tech firms have massive war chests to outspend competitors. Nvidia alone spent nearly $9 billion on R&D in 2024 and can quickly adapt to new threats by enhancing its offerings or lowering costs if necessary.

2. Nvidia‚Äôs dominance isn‚Äôt just about hardware‚Äîit‚Äôs deeply tied to its software ecosystem, particularly CUDA, which is the gold standard for AI and machine learning development. This ecosystem is entrenched in research labs, enterprises, and cloud platforms worldwide.

3. People have to understand the risk that comes with DeepSeek coming out of China. There will be major adoption barriers from key markets as folks worry about data security, sanctions, government overreach etc. 

4. US just announced $500b to AI infrastructure via Stargate. The government has substantial resourcing to subsidize or lower barriers for brands like Nvidia.",NVDA,NVIDIA

Hope to hear from everyone on their thoughts on this company / the future outlook on financials

# Macro Overview:

* **Economic Strength of Texas:**¬†Third Coast operates in Texas, whom remain one of the fastest-growing states in the U.S. that recently¬†[grew at 4.2% in Q3 2024](https://gov.texas.gov/business/page/texas-economic-snapshot#:~:text=(Texas%20Comptroller%20of%20Public%20Accounts,U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis)), faster than the nation as a whole. Business friendly policies like no state income tax, have helped corporate relocation's like Tesla, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard. Texas's economy is the¬†[eighth-largest](https://gov.texas.gov/business/page/texas-economic-snapshot#:~:text=(Texas%20Comptroller%20of%20Public%20Accounts,U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis))¬†when compared to nations of the world and is now valued at $2.6 trillion. Texas is expected to continue to grow and with that the need for lending capabilities should favor Third Coast.
* **Impact of Potential Deregulation:**¬†[Deregulation is expected to play a pivotal role](https://www.thebanker.com/content/05e97cf7-7d6a-580d-91cb-d27cd4d03092)¬†in the new administrations economic agenda. For community banks like Third Coast, this will allow them the ability to operate more freely with relaxed capital requirements. With fewer regulatory requirements, Third Coast can selectively increase their exposure to higher yielding loans and potential acquisitions. Typically, the ability to freely lend boosts bank earnings and growth. It allows the industry the flexibility to regulate themselves. With deregulation almost certain, focusing on further risk-taking is important. This approach may lead to increases in nonperforming loans down the line.

# Investment Thesis:

* **Presence In A High-Growth Region:**¬†Texas has one of the strongest economies in the U.S. consistently outpacing the national GDP growth rate. Third Coast has shown a great track record of impressive growth with a CAGR of over 25% and EPS growth of over 18% from 2020 to 2024. Deregulation in the banking industry is all but certain in the coming months. This will lead to increased lending capabilities that will fuel additional growth in a region that continues to outperform. Third Coast's lending increased 9% to $3.97 billion. Urban centers like Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Houston are hubs for technology, energy, and manufacturing. In particular, residential construction is anticipated to rebound in 2025 fueled by increased populations, jobs, and incomes.
* **Current Valuation:**¬†Third Coast has a P/E (TTM) of 14.65, slightly below the¬†[industry average of 14.8](https://simplywall.st/markets/us/financials/banks). Yet, the stock has risen over 93% in the last year alone and is just -2.5% from its 52-week high of $37.65. Despite the significant increase, Third Coast is still slightly undervalued. It is significantly under their five-year average high P/E of 16.9. With continued growth expected in the long-term, we believe it is best to either wait for a potential pullback, or continue holding.
* **Strong Financial Results:**¬†Fierce competition in Texas is intense with hundreds of banks. Nevertheless, Third Coast has achieved impressive results since their 2021 IPO. Revenue has increased 80%, EPS 194%, and net income 317%. Profitability metrics like return on average assets, return on average equity, and net profit margin have set new records. They have hit highs of 1.05%, 11.48%, and 27.82%, respectively. Nonperforming assets did however increase by 48.7% to 0.58% of total assets. While increases are not desired, the total is still significantly under the industry average indicating proper risk management for now.

# Loan Growth & Quality

* **Nonperforming loans:**¬†Often, solid loan growth comes with risky lending practices. Third Coast predominately lends to CRE and C&I, combined accounting for almost 60% of the total portfolio. Nonperforming loans increased by 61.4% to $27.95 million. A large reason for such a major increase stemmed from C&I accounting for over 51% of nonperforming loans. Non-farm non-residential owner occupied loans accounted for 39%. Fortunately, non-farm non-residential owner occupied loans decreased -14% despite their 11.3% weighting.
* **Nonperforming assets:**¬†Unsurprisingly, nonperforming assets increased by 48.7% as a result. Currently, nonperforming assets are only at 0.58% which is still minor for a community bank. We do not want to see a continuation of nonperforming assets. They can easily start to wipe out a bank's equity. Third Coast has grown fantastically, as has nonperforming loans and assets. Both are now at all-time highs for the banks. We will be monitoring this development in the upcoming quarters to ensure this does not rapidly continue.

# Earnings Overview

* **Revenue:**¬†Fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 16% to $171.38 million. Third Coast benefited from a 15.2% increase in net-interest income due to elevated interest rates. This allowed the bank to reprice loans at higher yields. Floating-rate loans especially boosted interest income, despite rising deposit costs. Total non-interest income also saw impressive growth of 29.4% to $10.62 million contributing to the overall increase in revenue.
* **Net Income:**¬†An impressive increase of 42.7% lead to a total of $47.67 million. This increase was primarily the result of increased net interest income, resulting from loan growth.
* **EPS:**¬†Earnings per share saw strength with growth of 40.4% to $2.78. Higher revenue, controlled cost management, and rising profitability were the primarily reasons for such an increase.",TSLA,Tesla
2025-01-27,16:04:45,investing,Jevon's Paradox explains why DeepSeek's breakthrough should increase Nvidia and TSMC demand,">Jevons‚Äô Paradox occurs when technological improvements or efficiency gains in resource use lead to an overall increase in resource consumption, rather than a decrease.

>**Initial Expectation**: Efficiency improvements (e.g., using less fuel per kilometer with more efficient cars) should reduce the consumption of the resource (fuel).

>**What Actually Happens**: Increased efficiency lowers the cost of using the resource, making it more accessible and attractive. This, in turn, can increase demand for the resource, potentially leading to greater overall consumption.

TSMC and Nvidia should be going up - not down - because of Deepseek. DeepSeek made OpenAI-level models cheap. Consumption will go drastically up. When consumption goes up, more Nvidia and TSMC chips will be purchased to power them.

Better models do not hurt Nvidia and TSMC. They help. TSMC and Nvidia don't care who is making the best models, as long as they make it on their hardware. I would sell TSMC/Nvidia if Deepseek trained their models on Chinese-made chips. But they trained them on 10k+ Nvidia GPUs made by TSMC.

Further more, it makes companies like OpenAI and Anthropic try even harder to build moat, which means going all in on data centers.

Finally, DeepSeek's own paper says to move to the next step, you need more compute power:

>Therefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, **advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning.**",NVDA,NVIDIA

Nvidia‚Äôs stock has been climbing without much pullback, while AMD has experienced slightly the opposite. Which one do you think is the better overall investment right now?  (I‚Äôm aware NVDA currently has 90% of the market share)

Is Nvidia overpriced, or is AMD still a solid choice for growth?

2025-01-24,05:04:40,investing,When to buy foreign currency to invest in foreign assets?,"I live in the EU and I'm mainly holding PLN, and if I want to buy an ETF that tracks the SP500 or a stock like Apple, I'm subject to currency fluctuations. 

If I want to buy let's say Apple, then my broker will take the PLN/USD exchange rate and charge me 0.50% for buying and then for selling based on the mid-market exchange rate.

This is usually not a problem, but there are times where a stock or ETF I want to buy is cheap, but the current exchange rate is not favorable, e.g. the dollar or euro is expensive at the moment or vice-versa‚ÄîI want to sell an asset but the dollar or euro is cheap.

Currently, the PLN is quite strong and I can buy the EUR and USD for fairly cheap compared to the past years. I'm wondering if it would make sense to exchange my PLN for these currencies and then buy and sell the assets directly with the currency, which would allow me to later sell my stocks without having to automatically reconvert back to PLN, meaning that I can wait for a favorable time to re-exchange them.

Any opinions would be greatly appreciated here, thanks!",AAPL,Apple

I‚Äôve never been one to buy into the AI hype but Apple‚Äôs implementation simply can‚Äôt work with their commitment to privacy. From a tech perspective, I believe the looser the restrictions in the name of privacy, the better the results. Which is why Siri has always sucked. 

There‚Äôs only so much you can do with on-device models. Developing a pattern based on your data will help. It also helps advertisers. Again, in my opinion why Google is better at AI.

I've invested long term in the defense sector companies and ETF's, and I'm looking to take a more proactive role in my trades with my new capital. I heard about this big joint Stargate deal and I wanted more information before I start building an investment portfolio.  
  
I read that the Data Centers are already being built in Abilene, Texas and started thinking of which part of this deal would be the best to invest in. There are the investors: MDX, Softbank, Blue Owl Capital, and Microsoft; The tech infrastructure players: Nvidia, OpenAI, Broadcom, TSMC, Oracle; And then the physical building & energy infrastructure that I'm most interested in.  
  
My thought process is: Regardless of whether or not the OpenAI deal follows through or not, builders and energy companies in the area will be getting a lot of money coming their way.  
I wasn't able to find any specific mentions of who is contracted to build out these Datacenters, who will be providing the electricity, nor whether they're publicly traded so I can invest. Any information about them, or how to find the ""back-end"" of these deals, and which companies/ETF's may get boosted by proximity or direct involvement is really appreciated, thank you guys.

2025-01-20,21:39:03,investing,What are your thoughts on AMD?,"Context: I am a sixteen year old self-investor with over 100k invested. I have been interested in financial markets for two years now and started investing at fourteen years old in my mother's TFSA - the Canadian equivalent of the USA's Roth IRA. I've been lucky to start investing at the perfect time to catch both years of 20%+ gains from the S&P500. I am very interested in learning about anything related with invested and markets. I plan to go to University and obtain a Bachelors of Finance. With that degree, I plan to become a financial analyst and hopefully later become a Portfolio Manager. I've learned a lot about thr investing world over the few years and I'm interested in AMD.

Analysis of AMD: In my opinion, AMD (Advanced Mirco Devices) is a BUY. When looking at its Income Statement and overall business performance and potential, I see the potential for massive growth in the next decade. It's down around 25% from last year but that's only a reason to keep buying the dip. Looking at it's PE ratio, it is relatively cheap when compared to NVDA. I know some people argue that NVDA is a much better company as it's profit margin and revenues are significantly higher than AMD, (As it will remain that way) but many people have the concept wrong. AMD does not have to beat NVDA to do well. AMD is crushing intel in the semiconductor sector as it continues to grow exponentially. I am also considering selling some of my equity positions to buy some less risky assets such as treasuries. The chance of the S&P500 doing more than 10% this year is slim and even if it does, the market is due for another correction in which I'll buy some stocks then.

2025-01-18,18:27:10,investing,TSMC: The Backbone of Global AI Chipmaking,"Summary:

* **Global Leadership in AI Chips:** TSMC dominates the semiconductor market, producing over 90% of the globe‚Äôs most advanced chips, crucial for AI and HPC applications.
* **Geopolitical Risks:** Taiwan‚Äôs political tensions with China and U.S. export restrictions could affect TSMC, but its Arizona expansion helps mitigate risks.
* **Strong Market Position:** Partnerships with Nvidia, Apple, and AMD highlight TSMC‚Äôs technological edge, particularly with 3nm and 5nm nodes.
* **Investment Potential:** Despite challenges, TSMC's 2025 focus on AI growth, HPC revenue, and strategic diversification underscores its value as a long-term investment.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the global leader in advanced chip manufacturing, powering the AI revolution with its cutting-edge technology. As the primary supplier for tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and AMD, TSMC produces over 90% of the world‚Äôs most advanced semiconductors, which are essential across industries, from military systems to consumer electronics. The company‚Äôs dominance is driven by its consistent investment in leading-edge processes, including 3nm and 5nm nodes, which form the backbone of high-performance computing and AI applications.

However, TSMC faces significant geopolitical risks due to its concentration in Taiwan, a region under constant tension with China, which views Taiwan as a breakaway province. A disruption in TSMC‚Äôs operations could spark a global semiconductor crisis, impacting economies worldwide. To mitigate these risks, TSMC has been diversifying its production capabilities, with a notable $40 billion investment in its Arizona facility. This expansion strengthens supply chain resilience and ensures U.S. access to cutting-edge chips for AI, defense, and other critical technologies. Additionally, the U.S. CHIPs Act offsets the high operational costs of U.S.-based facilities and supports workforce development.

TSMC‚Äôs position as the backbone of the AI and HPC sectors is underscored by its strategic collaboration with Nvidia to produce advanced AI chips, such as the Blackwell series, further cementing its role as a critical supplier in this rapidly growing market. In Q3 2024, TSMC‚Äôs revenue grew by 36% year-over-year, driven by strong AI-related demand, and it projects that mid-50% of its total revenue will come from HPC applications in 2025.

Despite its strengths, TSMC must navigate industry challenges, including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market, declining PC and smartphone demand, and Wall Street's caution over potential growth slowdowns. Innovations in AI-driven consumer technologies and CES product launches could help revitalize these segments, with TSMC‚Äôs advanced chipmaking capabilities playing a central role.

From a valuation perspective, TSMC‚Äôs forward P/E ratio of 22.81 and PEG ratio of 0.73 suggest that while the stock trades at a premium, it remains reasonable given the company‚Äôs earnings growth and leadership in the AI sector. Geopolitical risks, while significant, are partially mitigated by the company‚Äôs diversification and reduced reliance on China, which now accounts for only 10% of its revenue.

TSMC has outperformed the semiconductor market benchmark (SMH) due to its advanced technology and strategic partnerships, recovering more quickly from market selloffs and demonstrating strong resilience. The company‚Äôs ability to balance geopolitical risks, invest in cutting-edge technologies, and sustain high demand for its products positions it as an attractive long-term investment.

In conclusion, TSMC‚Äôs leadership in semiconductor innovation and its critical role in AI chipmaking make it indispensable to the global technology industry. While challenges remain, its proactive approach to diversification and its focus on high-growth sectors like AI and HPC ensure its continued success and solidify its appeal as an investment in 2025.

TLDR: TSMC is a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, pivotal for AI chipmaking with unmatched technological dominance. While geopolitical risks and U.S.-China tensions pose challenges, the company‚Äôs strategic expansions, such as its Arizona facilities, and its robust growth in AI-driven markets make it a compelling investment in 2025.

In Q3 2024, TSMC‚Äôs revenue grew by 36% year-over-year, driven by strong AI-related demand, and it projects that mid-50% of its total revenue will come from HPC applications in 2025.

Despite its strengths, TSMC must navigate industry challenges, including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market, declining PC and smartphone demand, and Wall Street's caution over potential growth slowdowns. Innovations in AI-driven consumer technologies and CES product launches could help revitalize these segments, with TSMC‚Äôs advanced chipmaking capabilities playing a central role.

From a valuation perspective, TSMC‚Äôs forward P/E ratio of 22.81 and PEG ratio of 0.73 suggest that while the stock trades at a premium, it remains reasonable given the company‚Äôs earnings growth and leadership in the AI sector. Geopolitical risks, while significant, are partially mitigated by the company‚Äôs diversification and reduced reliance on China, which now accounts for only 10% of its revenue.

TSMC has outperformed the semiconductor market benchmark (SMH) due to its advanced technology and strategic partnerships, recovering more quickly from market selloffs and demonstrating strong resilience. The company‚Äôs ability to balance geopolitical risks, invest in cutting-edge technologies, and sustain high demand for its products positions it as an attractive long-term investment.

In conclusion, TSMC‚Äôs leadership in semiconductor innovation and its critical role in AI chipmaking make it indispensable to the global technology industry. While challenges remain, its proactive approach to diversification and its focus on high-growth sectors like AI and HPC ensure its continued success and solidify its appeal as an investment in 2025.

TLDR: TSMC is a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, pivotal for AI chipmaking with unmatched technological dominance. While geopolitical risks and U.S.-China tensions pose challenges, the company‚Äôs strategic expansions, such as its Arizona facilities, and its robust growth in AI-driven markets make it a compelling investment in 2025.

2025-01-17,19:16:24,investing,Foreign ETFs/Stocks and Dollar depreciation question.,"I am curious if anyone knows how it would work if you owned an ETF like the MSCI Europe (Or a specific foreign stock) in a US account and a Dollar Depreciation event occurred.  

Since the ETF is European companies would the ETF go up passively against the weaker dollar?  Or since your account is denominated in dollars would it go down or be flat?  

On the other end, the Dollar has recently strengthened.  What would the effect be to such a position if that strengthening continued and the Euro weakened? 


My assumption is that on a dollar decline event you would get more dollars in return if you sold.  And on a dollar strengthening event you would lose some dollars.  But I am not sure because its possible these ETFs are  set up and run purely in dollars or something.  

Thanks in advance.

2025-01-17,12:38:35,investing,Criticize my stock picking portfolio,"This sub has some people who are smart, and probably more attuned to individual stock picking than I am. But I still like to invest in single stocks, although I am waiting to see if 5 years from now I should have invested in an index fund instead. I‚Äôd be thrilled to hear what‚Äôs bad in my portfolio. 

Francaise des Jeux, 33% of my portfolio. A French lottery monopoly. I bought the stock recently, because I think the business will do well in the future and the I liked the relative value compared to investing in top U.S companies. I felt that this business is more certain with the facts I could gather compared to investing in Apple for example. Apple is a great business too, but is valued higher in terms of earnings multiple or how much dividends I can get if I invested in it today. I like the fact that the company is growing and gives me certainty a bit. The French Government or the EU don‚Äôt have plans to regulate this business heavily in the near term. Meanwhile, the profitability is high.

Multitude, 22% of my portfolio. A small cap financial institution in Europe, that has 3 segments. One segment earns about 50 million euros in operating profit, while the two others drag the company‚Äôs earnings down. There I saw an opportunity, because the price at the lowest point when I bought was close to 50 million euros. Still makes me wonder whether the market has noticed something I haven‚Äôt. Maybe I am too optimistic that the value of this single unit is much higher than what is the current market value for the whole enterprise, about 100 million euros, and the market knows something I don‚Äôt.

Centrum Finansowe, 15% of my portfolio. A Polish financial operator, that provides debt collection services and financing to SMEs. The idea was that the price was cheap, and the financials looked solid. When I bought my first shares, the dividend yield was about 11%. If the business stayed solid, I would earn decent returns. There is a possibility of business improvement, meaning more earnings and dividends on my investment.

Indos, 12% of my portfolio. Similar idea to Centrum Finansowe. Solid financials and high dividend yield got me interested.

Japan Warranty Support, 13% of my portfolio. Initially I had looked up on this company‚Äôs competitor, Solvvy (known as Japan Living Warranty before), but the competitor decided to buy and merge an unrelated company to itself. Before, these two companies shared same characteristics: good profitability, operated in insurance and warranty business, and the stock prices did not seem egregious. Recently, JWS forecasted lower growth compared to its past performance, and the stock plummeted. I bought my shares at prices that are very close to today‚Äôs prices. Per one share, JWS has about 3000 yen in cash net of debt, meaning not including insurance liabilities but bonds and bank debt, and 4500 in net portfolio value. At a price of around 2300 to 2800 yen, I thought this could be a good buy. 

I invest globally, but have felt that stock prices move to opposite direction to what I expected. My picks have performed poorly, which leads me to think I am doing something wrong. Or there is randomness, I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs possible that investing in single stocks is not for me. Hopefully somebody smart would be so nice to criticize me. Thanks.

# There were three big announcements

# New Gaming Cards

Nvidia‚Äôs new line of¬†RTX 50 Series gaming graphics cards is based on the company‚Äôs Blackwell chip architecture. Considering the massive leap Blackwell has made over Hopper, its previous iteration in data center applications, getting it to work in gaming is a huge deal ‚Äì a massive improvement with superior rendering and higher frame rates for gamers.

# Digits

The Linux-based desktop computer with the GB 10 Grace Blackwell Superchip with a CPU and GPU. A first in its history at $3,000 ‚ÄúPlacing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher, and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI,‚Äù Huang said.

It may seem like a niche product for high-end engineers/professors/scientists and researchers, but I think it‚Äôs a deliberate and excellent strategy to evangelize the product, through the folks who can develop use cases and apps that can further the market for cheaper at scale mass Digits in the future.

This is straight from the Nvidia playbook from the last two decades ‚Äì they have always involved the scientific and research community from the start. I can bet a large number of these are going to be distributed free to campuses.

I think Digits will turn out to be a very consequential product for Nvidia ‚Äì with several billion in revenue in a few years. But forecasts aside, what‚Äôs key is that Digits uses a scaled-down version of Nvidia‚Äôs Grace AI server CPU technology. It‚Äôs packaged in a Mac Mini-sized form factor with the help of Taiwan-based¬†**MediaTek**, which Huang commended for its expertise in building low-power chips.

Quoting Tae Kim from Barron‚Äôs who authored an excellent book on Nvidia

>Over time, the logical move for Nvidia would be to scale down this CPU further for consumer Windows laptops. By integrating its graphics expertise, MediaTek‚Äôs power-saving capabilities, and the efficiency of Arm-based CPU technology, Nvidia could create a processor that offers leading graphics for gaming and high performance for productivity, along with long battery life. While prior Arm-based Windows PCs have struggled with software compatibility, Nvidia‚Äôs top-notch software engineering could make it work.

Huang strongly hinted that the introduction of Digits was a precursor to the PC market, even as there are questions about why Nvidia chose Linux over Windows ‚Äì and we should hear more about that at their GTC conference in March.

It could shake up the moribund PC market, which has been suffering from a lack of growth rates after COVID-19. Desktop PCs and laptop computers still generate large revenues for¬†**Intel**¬†and¬†**Advanced Micro Devices**, the primary makers of x86-based processors ‚Äì a legacy that could give way to ARM-based processors, which Apple uses. Analysts expect Intel to generate $30 billion in revenue from its client computing business in 2024, according to FactSet, while AMD has $6.7 billion in revenue in its client segment.

Billions of potential new revenue are at stake for Nvidia, which is forecasted to make about $180Bn in sales in the 12 months ending January 2026. While data center takes up the largest share of revenue at about $150Bn of that pie and gaming, auto, and professional visualization (Omniverse) take the rest, a new source would help a great deal when data center revenue growth slows down.

In the past two years, Nvidia has monopolized the AI data center market with the best-designed, highest-performing chips. Nvidia would likely make a significant dent in the PC market as well as the new paradigm in edge computing with all the computing power and constant innovation and upgrades at its disposal.

**It's Time To Call Bullshit - Quantum**

¬†

TLDR: While I am super excited for what Quantum Computers could do for society in the distant future, it is probably a bad investment right now... the bubble will pop.

**NVDA CEO says the tech is decades away:** [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-ceo-says-useful-quantum-164500814.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-ceo-says-useful-quantum-164500814.html)

**John Chambers also says the tech is a decade away:** [https://www.investors.com/news/technology/quantum-computing-further-out-ai-decade-john-chambers/](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/quantum-computing-further-out-ai-decade-john-chambers/)

**Quantum Supremacy Book by Michio Kaku:** [Book Link for those interested](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Supremacy-Computer-Revolution-Everything/dp/0385548362/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.D7Bczi_0QIAc-RqJ7jghwrWXC-R09YHI7ernESu4zWyZZ2ZqdfgmUG4cZt8iROji9wONEOak7Yv7y0RVvkPasadZWzRKJulNneepEfNJXMhkkOCCy3lDeRCnR2HTfqa7yDZS3HJWXL9h_u85I_96NF2ntAPUFxBCdkZ81qFe5UKoiY4Qdc3SL4rMfeen82i96CWBTrkcyNAOMM5mJUW9H3M0xYqae7BfwRDJFwrDQck.fmhAapVE9Fu469jVwof5LZ1ZNC1sgJYpKzXoHM6UohM&dib_tag=se&hvadid=673719860568&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9001989&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=14895901813478405611&hvtargid=kwd-2022409010301&hydadcr=22593_13531299&keywords=quantum+supremacy+by+michio+kaku&qid=1737038634&sr=8-1) This is the Physicist who we have all seen on YouTube probably explain something confusing about how the universe works. Well he wrote this book a year ago, before people knew wtf quantum was... and basically got the readers hyped about quantum but says like 100 times in the book that we won't see this stuff happen until 2050. Maybe a decade away for some things in the pharma industry. Very refreshing to get a non-Wall Street person talking about the space, and frankly, he probably knows best given he's a worldly known Physicist. I read this over the holidays, it was a great read fyi (not an ad, just saying).

¬†

**Short Quantum thesis by Martin Shkreli:** [https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1876950624824177127](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1876950624824177127) Think what you want of the pharma bro, but he wrote an excellent piece on why he is short quantum. TLDR: the best quantum companies are GOOG and IBM. Both are too large to see any financial impact from quantum on the stock. However, these two stocks have the balance sheet to support massive/costly R&D in quantum that these smaller ""quantum"" companies don't have. He makes the interesting point that these companies went public (IONQ, Rigetti, D Wave, etc) because they are running out of money and need to raise money and dilute shareholders to stay afloat. IF they were that good, they would have been scooped up by IBM and GOOG already. He also notes the best quantum companies (outside of GOOG and IBM) are still private, so average people like you and I can't invest in them anyways. Basically the shitty quantum companies are the ones that are public right now.

¬†

**And most importantly, the computers don't work well. IONQ and RGTI computers are actually down right now.** [https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879607624569872443](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879607624569872443) & [https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879896705434591582](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879896705434591582)

These computers aren't even online right now for IONQ and RGTI.

¬†

Basically this all seems like an emotional yolo into quantum. Most people don't understand it and the commerical applications are years and years, probably decades away. I would invest with caution as this has bubble written all over it , imo. Yes, I am short right now. ",NVDA,NVIDIA

My overall outlook on the company is still bullish in the long-term, and I do plan to hold some of my shares, but with the market cap at nearly $3.3T I do not see the same trend of parabolic growth continuing.

Nvidia makes up roughly 30% of my portfolio.

Now the part that I am looking for advice on is how you determine the entry strategy of strike/date for the most efficient premiums? Opinions seem to vary with general consensus being weeklies or monthly and targeting strikes with a delta between 0.1 - 0.15 to reduce the risk of being assigned. As well, avoiding selling CCs on red days, close to earnings, or big new drop.

What is your CC strategy for entry? Do you target a specific % daily increase in price before entering? Do you use 50/100/200 day averages as a guideline? 

Would love to hear all the different strategies folks have employed, and how it has been working for you.

2025-01-14,19:49:22,investing,"If I'm hoping to retire BEFORE 63, should I be maxing my 401k contributions? ","30M for reference. 

I've been thinking about this for a few weeks now. I've been making max contributions to my company's 401k now for the last 3 years (since I joined) and across all 401ks that I have between my current and former employers, I'm sitting at 100k currently. Seeing the 100k for the first time felt really nice and it has made me realize how much closer I could be to retirement. 

Looking at a quick investment calculator, I'm on track to hit 1 million in my 401k in about 18 years assuming a modest 6% return rate with an average of 2k contributions per month (assuming no change to monthly contributions, so the true value here may be higher) which is my current personal goal. BUT 1million wouldn't immediately be enough for me to retire immediately (assuming I follow the 4% rule), and I'm hoping over time my periodic contributions will increase. 

But thinking about it, if I technically can't utilize this money properly until I'm in my early 60s (because it's been hammered in my head that we get penalized for pulling from a 401k before age ~63, with a few exceptions), is it worth it to keep contributing the max amount of money to a 401k vs a personal investment account? I have a personal investment account that is currently sitting at about 70k (VOO and some other personal tech stocks, like Microsoft, Nvidia) and I'm wondering if it would be a better move to just move more of my 401k contributions to my personal investment account instead? 

I'm not an expert in this area by any means, I've just been viewing all of these accounts as a form of savings accounts since I'm fortunate enough to be able to even set aside this money. And so this is the current situation that I'm in. I would love to be able to live a life not tied to a 9-5 and instead retire to work in an industry I enjoy at my own leisure(or get to a COAST amount minimum).

Such a revenue-generating implementation would be a major catalyst for the share price. However, operating in a very hot field, their substantive patent portfolio alone is likely worth significantly more than the current company valuation, drastically reducing the risk.¬†

¬†**My investment strategy:**

I consider myself a value investor, at least in the sense that I search for companies that are overlooked‚Äîand undervalued‚Äîby the market. Specifically, I spend a lot of time analyzing small, international companies, and I prefer to focus on those in the technology sector. Why? Because oftentimes, groundbreaking innovation comes not from the giant behemoths with thousands of employees and near limitless funding. Instead, it comes from small groups of talented people with great ideas and no bureaucracy to limit them. These small, early-stage companies often have quite unattractive finance sheets, so just looking at the bottom line won‚Äôt tell you much. Instead, I focus on three main points:

1. The people: An investment in a company is really an investment in the people running it. You can have the most promising technological solution and all the money in the world, but if the people in charge lack the skillsets, connections and passion to utilize it, it‚Äôs never going to take off.¬†
2. The product: Is there a need for it? Does it solve a problem? What is the market for it? What is the competition? You know the drill.
3. The valuation (and the financials): What has been priced in? Does the valuation make any sense? Also, I know I said the financials in these companies are often an eye-sore, but there are different levels of hell. Is there an imminent risk for bankruptcy or new share issues? How much do they spend a year? How long will it realistically be until they start making money?

It may sound obvious, but I really stick to these points. If one of them doesn‚Äôt hold up, I don‚Äôt invest. To quote Munger:¬†

*""And the wise ones bet heavily when the world offers them that opportunity. They bet big when they have the odds. And the rest of the time, they don't. It's just that simple.""*¬†

Meaning, I turn down the vast majority of the companies I analyze. But once in a while‚Äîwhen I find what I believe to be a truly undervalued company‚ÄîI bet heavily on them. With BeammWave, this is one of those times, and I would love to hear your thoughts on it:

**BeammWave‚Äôs people:**¬†

The company is founded‚Äîand still run by‚Äîengineers. There is not one professional finance-bro-hustler within sight, only these old grandpas (literally) with more than a century of combined experience working at the biggest telecom companies in the world. For example:

¬∑¬†CEO: Stefan Svedberg, an electrical engineer who at Ericsson had a driving role in the development and global success of Bluetooth.¬†Was also responsible for several M&As.

¬∑ VP of Business and Sales: Robert Cadman, who was in part responsible for bringing the Bluetooth technology to the markets.¬†

¬∑¬†Chief Systems Architect: Bengt Lindoff, one of the world‚Äôs most prolific inventors with 2000+ patents in his name, who most recently had a top position at Huawei (developing 5G systems).

¬∑¬†Chairman of the board: Fredrik Rosenqvist, a civil engineer and the ex-CEO of Saab Ventures, who amongst other things facilitated the sale of C3 to Apple.

I could go on, but you get the drill. Together, they not only carry an enormous respect within the industry‚Äîwith far-reaching connections to the people at the very top of the big companies‚Äîbut also an incredible know-how in just what it takes to successfully launch a new, revenue-generating technology. Also, they clearly have a lot of faith in‚Äîand passion for‚ÄîBeammWave. If not, why would they all leave their cushy jobs at these giant companies to spend all their time and effort (and personal money) on this small start-up?

**BeammWave‚Äôs product:**¬†

Wait, why¬†*did*¬†they actually leave their top jobs and go work for a start-up? Well, it‚Äôs because BeammWave¬†has achieved something no one else has done before: distributed digital beamforming (DDBF) at millimeter-wave frequencies.

So, what‚Äôs that?¬†

In short, it‚Äôs an objectively superior way to build the mmWave wireless communication systems of the future (meaning 5G, 6G and all the other Gs to come), providing much better data speed, capacity, signal strength and power consumption than what is currently used (i.e., analog beamforming). In addition, their DDBF solution also solves several of the critical problems facing the industry today, including frequency capacity saturation, the infamous mmWave Non-line-of-sight (NLos) sensitivity and more.

Companies like Verizon, Qualcomm and Apple has poured BILLIONS of dollars into mmWave technology, but so far it really doesn‚Äôt work very well. I won‚Äôt get into the details of the technology here, but if you find this post intriguing, I would highly recommend you to read up on it before investing. I believe it‚Äôs going to be difficult to really grasp the potential value of BeammWave (and how one small start-up could achieve what the market leaders couldn‚Äôt) if you don‚Äôt understand the technology at least at a basic level. Just know that literally everyone in the field agree that digital beamforming is far superior to the analog version used today. The problem has been that DBF has historically been more complex (ill-fitted for mass production), uses more power and costs more money. With BeammWave's solution, it is actually both cheaper, uses less power and is designed for mass volume production, while still delivering far higher data speeds etc. than the analog versions.

So why aren't other companies interest in their technology? Well, who said they weren't? BeammWave currently has 3 customers: Molex (a big electronics supplier for a lot of companies, including Apple), Alpha Networks (a Taiwanese electronics company) and an anonymous Asian market leader likely to be Murata (also an Apple supplier). These companies have already purchased BeammWave's development platform ADP1 and are currently building their own prototype products with it. Furthermore, BeammWave has a number of other partners, including Saab and Ericsson, while also having signed NDAs with other companies (think Samsung and Qualcomm) and are having ongoing discussions with a large number of companies (including ""the biggest companies you can imagine"", a CEO direct quote). As a testament to this, they have been given access to one of the biggest foundries in the world (in Germany) to produce their prototype chips (and assisting BeammWave with material/production). This is practically unheard of for a company of this size.

So, what does BeammWave actually do? Their actual product is an extremely advanced, 3x3mm radio-frequency integrated circuit (RFIC), coupled with software. It is optimized for high-volume production, with the goal to replace the currently used antennas/RFICs in not only smartphones, but in radar systems and satellites, drones, IoT devices, automotives, and FWA systems. They are likely to be earning 1-2 USD/chip, and a typical smartphone would carry 6-10 chips. Given that there are more than 1 billion smartphones produced annually (and that the handset market is just ONE of BeammWave‚Äôs markets), it actually becomes quite ridiculous when you start to crunch the numbers. We‚Äôre talking tens of billions of dollars if they manage to get even, let‚Äôs say, 15% of their TAM, and that is not considering how the mmWave market is expected to have a CAGR of 15-40% until 2030.¬†Importantly, their technology is compatible with the current infrastructure, meaning that it's not necessary to replace current basestations etc. in order for it to work. 

What about the competition? Well, right now, there isn‚Äôt actually any competition. BeammWave is literally the first company in the world to succeed in doing this.¬†This is of course likely to change, but considering the ""minefield of patents"" (a literal quote from the CEO) that they have put down around the concept of DDBF, and their intention to ""own the entire field"" (another literal quote), it will likely be very difficult for other players to develop similar solutions without having to pay licensing fees to BeammWave. Remember, it's not really a question¬†*if*¬†digital beamforming will replace the analog technology: it's a question of who will do it. And right now, however unlikely it may seem, BeammWave appears to be winning the race.

So far, the people and the product are all green in my book. What about the valuation (and the financials)?¬†

**BeammWave‚Äôs valuation (and financials):**

At the IPO in 2022, the valuation was around 200M SEK, which at the time was considered modest. Now, more than two years, 40 patent applications, a few giant customers and even more collaborations later, the valuation is...150M SEK (5 SEK/share) This is somewhat equal to what they have spent on the R&D, meaning that you get 10+ years of research from some of the best engineers in the field basically free of charge. Furthermore, they have practically zero debt. Analysts estimate the fair value¬†*right now*¬†(without any further deals) to be 7-12 SEK.

They just completed a warrants issue, and coupled with grants and sales of their ADP1 platform in Q4, they should have about 50M SEK in cash at hand right now, with the annual burn rate of 2023 being around 29M SEK. Thus, they should be liquid enough to get through at least 1 full year without any additional revenue. However, they have made clear that they expect several more customers short-term, and their stated plan is to have revenue-generation products hitting the market in 2025-2026. So far, they have never made any attempt at unwarranted hype-building, or promised things they couldn't keep, so I have no clear reason to doubt their words on this.

**So what's the catch?**  
I guess now would be a good time to ask what the problem is. The thing is, I don't know. There has so far been no failures, no broken promises, no deals that have fallen through or actually any signs of industry lack-of-interest. I genuinely don't understand the valuation, and would appreciate feedback on this, but I have two hypotheses:

1. BeammWave is listed on a small, Nordic market (Nasdaq First North) with very little influx of international investors.
2. The technology is incredibly complex and not very sexy. No one gets excited about radios, antennas, frequencies and complex telecom terminology. And, since the company is headed by engineers, they have had trouble presenting the company in a way that investors understand. Simply put, people don‚Äôt understand what the hell they are doing, and subsequently also fail to grasp the enormous potential of their technology.¬†

Furthermore, there are several obvious risks associated with investing in a company of this size (and in this industry). Here are the main Challenges & Risks as listed in their 2023 annual report:

1. **High-Competition Market:**
   * Operating in a field with resource-rich global competitors, where patent disputes are common.
   * Risk of design issues in their advanced semiconductor products, which could lead to costly rework or delayed launches.
2. **Operational Sustainability:**
   * Dependent on successful execution of product commercialization and effective utilization of raised capital.

Fair points. However, I think the management has done basically everything they can to reduce those risks as much as possible:

1. **Patent disputes:**¬†They are talking with pretty much everyone in the field (and have been for years), having either signed deals/partnerships or NDAs with most. I believe this extensive networking and deep-reaching connections is a significant hedge against patent infringement, especially compared to start-ups run by less-experienced/connected people.¬†
2. **Product commercialization:**¬†¬†The prospect of a successful commercialization is greatly helped by the early access to a world-class foundry, in addition to letting customers use ADP1 to build their own prototypes using BeammWave's technology. This way, it's up to the customers to make it work, with BeammWave adopting a supporting role. Also, considering the steady influx of new customers/partners/projects, I think it's quite unlikely that the technology doesn't work. There would be signs by now (cancelled deals/aborted projects etc.). It‚Äôs also important to add that For BeammWave, mass-volume-production was the number 1 criteria from the very beginning, and considering the experience they have (and the amount of testing they have done), I find it unlikely to discover any major flaws in the product. At least when compared to your average, run-of-the-mill tech start-up. 

With this said, I would love your feedback on this, and any criticism is highly appreciated. This post got really long, despite me trying to keep it relatively short. For example, I haven't event touched on the prospects of an acquisition, which I personally believe is probably the most likely case (by Apple, Qualcomm or some other giant player).

Cheers!

**Disclaimer:**  
I own about 32k shares of BeammWave and I intend to hold these for at least 2 years, or until acquisition. This is not a P&D (but I guess that is what at smart P&D:er would say), but a long-term holding with the potential to generate extreme profits. I‚Äôm not posting this analysis to pump the share price‚Äîany upcoming deal will be enough of a catalyst‚Äîbut frankly because I‚Äôm frustrated that a company with this potential is practically unknown outside of the industry, and I thought you might find it interesting.¬†

I'm 35 and have a growing family. This also happens to be a good year for me to make some gains with stocks because I'm taking a lot of time off from work this year for family bonding and will likely fall into a lower tax bracket. I still have to speak with my CPA about this.

After selling some of these shares, I plan to purchase more index funds that track with the S&P 500. I feel more comfortable with this move, even if it means losing out on further NVDA gains in 10-20+ years. I have a feeling there will be some pullback on the stock and AI in the shortterm.

I‚Äôm a 20-year-old university student, and I‚Äôve been dabbling in investments since I was 14. My approach so far has been quite basic, focusing on the following:

* Buying IPOs from family accounts and selling them 5 days later,
* Depositing funds into Binance dollar-backed coins up to the soft cap and earning interest,

I'm thinking more about their story, how they make money, whether they do it consistently, P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA, low debt, etc. 

I lurk around on r/ValueInvesting and have gotten some good book recommendations, although I mostly use them for reference rather than reading them in their entirety. 

The S&P 500 was at a P/E ratio of over 100 in 2008 when the market crashed, although there have been pullbacks and recessions with lower P/Es than at current levels. All that to say, maybe the market is overvalued by traditional valuation metrics. I guess I'm trying to understand why many users and even successful YouTubers like Joseph Carlson and others recommend many high P/E companies. I gather that these companies have a sustainable competitive advantage with a lot of growth priced in. I'm talking about companies like SPGI, ASML, GOOGL (this actually seems like a growth company with decent valuations), UBER, ARM, NVDA, AVGO, META, FTNT, AMD, etc.

These companies seem to have a good moat, great CEO's, strong balance sheets but a lot of growth priced in. Frankly, it seems like one could do quite well with companies like these. I've underperformed significantly (thankfully with small positions for the purposes of gaining experience) picking stocks with what I thought were traditional value metrics, companies like HDSN, JILL, ALB, CP, VIRC, etc. Granted, I don't really feel like I have a circle of competence and didn't look too much into how these companies make money. I'll admit that I was riding mostly on the convictions of others, which I recognize is a major issue in itself that I intend to correct going forward. 

So for those of you who invest in individual companies and have had success, here are some questions;

1) Is it productive to differentiate between growth and value companies?

2) Is it fruitful to look for companies with a 10-15 P/E ratio and other ""deep value"" metrics or is traditional value investing dead altogether due to modern age computing power?

3) Does the rise in popularity of index investing exacerbate irrationality in markets to the point where valuations don't matter?

2025-01-09,20:57:36,investing,Question about ADR regarding ADR vs actual stock performance,"Hi,

I am interested in investing in some overseas companies, but some of those countries have lot minimums that i do not want to invest THAT much (due to how much it would screw with my desired allocation.

So I am going to use Sumitomo Corp as an example. 

In Japan, the stock ticker is 8053 on the TYO stock exchange.

When googling around, I see SSUMY and SSUMF... What is the difference between the two?

Is SSUMY is listed in the Sumitomo's webpage, so I guess that is the official ADR? That would mean someone (CITI in this case) owns the shares to Sumitomo, and do an ADR and tie 1 ADR share to 1  Sumitomo share (in this instance)? 

And is SSUMF basically Sumitomo Corp but in USD instead of JPY, and it is tied somehow together?



My other question is what causes the difference in performance between the SSUMY  which Sumitomo list as their ""official"" ADR and their 8053 ticker in TYO stock exchange?

For example, YTD SSUMY is up 1.23%, but 8053 is down 5.65%.

1YR SSUMY is down 1.25% but 8053 is up 2.73%...

5 Yr, SSSUMY is up 46.34% but 8053 is up 102 ish %.

Is the difference partially because ADR usually don't 100% correlate with the stock back in Tokyo? 

and the currency performance between yen and dollar has something to do with it?

Like the Yen for the 5 YR has substantially weaken to the dollar, so the 102% for 8053 drops to 46% after the conversion to the dollar for the ADR?

I'm also asking because I am interested in LVMH, but there is also LVMHF LVMUY, and MC on the Paris exchange, but the performance is also all over the place.",MC.PA,LVMH

2025-01-08,17:24:34,investing,Carvana: A Compelling Opportunity Amid Market Volatility,"**Summary**

* Carvana‚Äôs stock has dropped \~30% from its 2024 peak of $263, now trading at around $195, making it a more appealing entry point.
* The dip follows a short report by Hindenburg Research, but Carvana‚Äôs expansion in reconditioning facilities and improved wholesale-retail spreads are driving sustainable GPU growth.
* At \~23x adjusted EBITDA, Carvana‚Äôs valuation is more reasonable, and the stock becomes an even stronger buy if it dips into the $150 range.
* Macro factors like incoming tariffs on Canadian/Mexican imports may raise new car prices, shifting more market share to used car platforms like Carvana.

The market dynamics in 2025 are markedly different from those of 2024. Last year, the investment world was dominated by AI and large-cap companies like NVIDIA, leaving little room for under-the-radar opportunities. This year, however, savvy single-stock selection will likely be the key to outperforming the market. With its combination of strong revenue growth, expanding margins, and a now-corrected valuation, Carvana is a compelling pick for investors ready to dig deeper into individual names.

The short report from Hindenburg Research, while impactful in the short term, has created what many might see as a temporary distortion in Carvana‚Äôs valuation. While these reports often generate skepticism, the overall reaction from Wall Street analysts has been relatively defensive of Carvana‚Äôs position, suggesting that the sell-off may be overdone. The question remains: are short reports a distraction, or do they offer valid reasons to reassess a company‚Äôs fundamentals? For Carvana, the long-term outlook suggests the former.

The timing for investing in Carvana is compelling for several reasons. First, the stock‚Äôs valuation has undergone a meaningful reset, with its \~30% drop from its peak making the entry point significantly more attractive. At \~23x adjusted EBITDA, the valuation aligns more closely with the company‚Äôs expected growth, which analysts project at 17% year-over-year revenue growth for FY25. This revised valuation strikes a balance between growth potential and risk, offering a solid entry point for investors.

Second, macroeconomic conditions are shaping up in Carvana‚Äôs favor. Tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, expected to take effect soon, are likely to drive up the cost of new cars. This shift could divert more buyers to the used car market, where Carvana holds a significant position. Higher new car prices may also allow used car retailers like Carvana to raise their own prices, further widening the spreads between wholesale acquisition costs and retail sale prices. These dynamics should support continued GPU growth, which has already seen impressive gains in recent quarters.

Carvana‚Äôs Gross Profit Per Unit (GPU) is a central measure of its profitability, and the company has made significant strides in improving this metric. In the most recent quarter, GPU rose 20% year-over-year, reaching $7,685. This growth has been driven by several factors, including increased efficiency in retail vehicle sales, stronger performance in wholesale vehicle sales, and contributions from other revenue streams such as loan origination.

The breakdown of GPU for Q3 2024 highlights the company‚Äôs ability to drive profitability across its operations. Retail vehicle sales contributed $3,617 per unit, a 26% increase year-over-year. Wholesale vehicle sales added $571 per unit, up 53% year-over-year. While the contribution from wholesale marketplace sales declined slightly, the ‚Äúother‚Äù revenue category‚Äîwhich includes loan originations‚Äîrose by 15%, contributing $2,945 per unit.

Loan origination has faced some headwinds, particularly with concerns about auto credit quality among buyers like Ally Financial. However, this represents a smaller portion of Carvana‚Äôs overall GPU growth, and the company has demonstrated that its core operations are more than capable of driving profitability. By focusing on economies of scale in its reconditioning facilities and leveraging wider wholesale-retail spreads, Carvana has built a solid foundation for sustainable GPU growth.

At a market cap of $37.59 billion and an enterprise value of $42.44 billion, Carvana‚Äôs current valuation reflects a company in transition. Analysts expect Carvana to generate $15.77 billion in revenue for FY25, with adjusted EBITDA projected to grow by 68%. This positions Carvana at \~22.9x EV/adjusted EBITDA, a much more palatable multiple for a company with its growth potential.

The company‚Äôs rapid growth in retail unit sales, combined with favorable macroeconomic conditions, sets the stage for continued expansion. With unit sales growing at 34% year-over-year in Q3 2024, and GPU benefiting from higher dealership spreads, Carvana has multiple levers to pull for sustained growth.

For investors, the current price of $195 represents a rare buying opportunity. If the stock slides further to the $160-$170 range, it becomes an even stronger case for adding to positions. The real question is whether Carvana can maintain its momentum in a market that‚Äôs increasingly challenging for high-growth companies. Does this valuation correction represent a turning point for the company, or will further challenges emerge?

2025-01-07,19:58:01,investing,Nvidia: Expect Valuation To Soar Higher On 2025's AI Spending Increases,"# Summary

* Nvidia‚Äôs 2024 revenue surged by 86% to $113.3 billion, with operating income doubling to $71 billion.
* Hyperscalers are expected to increase AI-focused capital expenditures by 50% in 2025, reaching $300 billion.
* Nvidia‚Äôs next-generation Blackwell architecture offers up to 15x performance improvements, securing its 90% market dominance in AI GPUs.
* Competitors like AMD and Broadcom struggle with ecosystem integration and software optimization, solidifying Nvidia‚Äôs lead.
* Analysts project a 50x earnings multiple and a target price of $225 per share for 2025.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) enjoyed unprecedented financial success in 2024, driven by a wave of hyperscaler investments in data center infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Revenues soared by 86%, reaching $113.3 billion, while operating income more than doubled to $71 billion, signaling the company‚Äôs dominance in the AI sector.

Despite such robust growth, concerns over a potential slowdown are misplaced. The global push toward AI and machine learning shows no signs of waning. Leading technology giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Google are significantly expanding their high-performance computing capabilities to meet the surging demand for generative AI, large language models, and advanced AI applications.

In 2024, hyperscaler capital expenditures on data centers totaled approximately $200 billion. For 2025, this figure is projected to rise by 50%, hitting $300 billion. According to Morgan Stanley, Amazon and Microsoft are set to lead this spending spree with investments of $96.4 billion and $89.9 billion, respectively. Google and Meta will closely follow, allocating $62.6 billion and $52.3 billion to their AI-driven infrastructure.

This aggressive investment is underpinned by statements from top executives. Google‚Äôs CFO noted that while growth in capital expenditures won‚Äôt match the leap between 2023 and 2024, further increases are expected. Similarly, Meta‚Äôs CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted plans for significant growth in infrastructure spending. Microsoft, too, has committed $80 billion for AI-oriented data center construction in fiscal 2025.

Nvidia, with its 90% share of the AI GPU market, is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this surge in spending. The release of its next-generation Blackwell architecture in early 2025 promises substantial performance gains, including up to 2.5 times the training performance of its Hopper GPUs and as much as 15 times higher inference capabilities in select benchmarks. These advancements, paired with Nvidia‚Äôs proprietary CUDA platform, reinforce its unassailable ecosystem of hardware and software solutions.

Competitors like AMD and Broadcom continue to face hurdles. AMD‚Äôs MI300X GPUs, while promising on paper, have failed to deliver comparable performance due to software deficiencies. Broadcom‚Äôs custom silicon projects, although intriguing, lack the versatility and support ecosystem Nvidia GPUs provide. Consequently, neither competitor poses a significant threat in the near term, with meaningful competition unlikely before 2026 or 2027.

# TL;DR

Nvidia‚Äôs remarkable 2024 growth, fueled by hyperscaler investments, will continue as AI spending surges 50% in 2025 to $300 billion. With its dominant 90% GPU market share and groundbreaking Blackwell architecture, Nvidia is well-positioned for further success.¬†

2025-01-07,19:49:51,investing,The outlook for ASML & the lithography industry,"ASML just had its investor day, and the big takeaway was that they stuck to their long-term revenue forecast. That definitely calmed some nerves after the recent 2025 downgrade and a pretty lackluster year for orders.

But if you dig a little deeper, there are some interesting shifts happening in the semiconductor world, especially with AI shaking things up. One standout is memory‚Äîbecause datacenter GPUs rely so heavily on volatile memory, ASML seriously bumped up its growth forecast for DRAM wafer volumes over the next six years. On the flip side, NAND wafer growth took a pretty big hit:

https://preview.redd.it/879zmvu1ilbe1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb72ad6bb45052ab9028a48f22bf0eebcc38db69

A bunch of this growth is still gonna happen in the cloud, with AI training and inference servers pumping up the datacenter semis market and keeping that sweet CAGR looking good.

As AI servers are both DDR and HBM intensive, this drives the strongly expected growth in the number of DRAM wafers mentioned above:

# ASML‚Äôs High-NA Outlook

ASML‚Äôs take on high-NA is basically, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre good to go‚Äîthe tools are ready, we‚Äôre ready, and the ecosystem‚Äôs ready.‚Äù The only catch? Because the optics are bigger, these tools use a half-field exposure. In plain English, that means each shot only prints half the circuit design compared to older EUV systems, which isn‚Äôt great for productivity. But ASML says they‚Äôve tackled this by speeding up how quickly the tool moves between fields.

Looking at the numbers, high-NA can crank out 175 wafers per hour (WPH), which is pretty solid, especially when you compare it to the latest version of regular EUV running at 220 WPH.

https://preview.redd.it/hjhkqgrp6mbe1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=467cc6c3d6172df2576d7851ea9f87c8b0ef3824

Bottom line‚Äîhigh-NA‚Äôs productivity is already impressive and even better than the older EUV systems ASML has out there. Plus, there‚Äôs a clear plan to make these tools even faster. Honestly, it‚Äôs wild to think about how chaotic EUV was a decade ago, with everyone freaking out about whether it would ever actually catch on.

# EUV just keeps leveling up

ASML had a tough time getting EUV off the ground at first‚Äîearly tools couldn‚Äôt hit decent source power, and productivity kind of sucked. But since then, they‚Äôve been on a mission to crank up source power and, in turn, boost productivity.

**Here‚Äôs the deal:** more source power means wafers get exposed faster, so the tools can churn through more wafers per hour. And more wafers per hour? That‚Äôs good news for everyone. ASML gets to slap higher price tags on its tools and rake in better margins, while customers lower their cost per wafer by cranking out more in less time.

https://preview.redd.it/qr388t047mbe1.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f6f7a585a1ae641ac1b6502cf8829dc0314bbdb

And this isn‚Äôt the end of the story. ASML‚Äôs already got a solid roadmap to keep pushing productivity even higher for both its low-NA and high-NA tools, so there‚Äôs plenty more to come.

# ASML‚Äôs 2030 Game Plan

ASML isn‚Äôt just about building cutting-edge litho tools‚Äîthey‚Äôre also pros at mapping out long-term financial goals. Here‚Äôs how they do it: they take a guess at how many wafers will be pumped out at each node by 2030, then work backward to figure out how many exposures those wafers will need using their tools. They factor in everything‚ÄîEUV, immersion, basic DUV, KrF, i-line, and metrology.

Next, they estimate how productive each tool will be, which helps them figure out how many tools need to be in the market and how many more they‚Äôll need to sell. On top of that, they throw in around EUR 12 billion a year in revenue just for servicing all the tools already out there.

When you crunch the numbers, it adds up to somewhere between EUR 44 and 60 billion in revenue by 2030. And if you look at ASML‚Äôs track record, they‚Äôve always hit or even beaten their targets. To make a solid return on this stock, we probably need to see them hit at least EUR 50 billion in revenue.

https://preview.redd.it/ju29xczm7mbe1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=21d0fc95ad1b6bcfada4949443545473b050fe87

As for margins, the guidance isn‚Äôt crazy aggressive. Honestly, the only reason the advanced semi industry is still scaling at all is because of ASML. Yet, weirdly enough, their margins are still lower than a lot of other big players in silicon. Go figure.

https://preview.redd.it/1bgzjxqp7mbe1.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c3f525119e7a75c74e04ffa9e2ac278fdbced1

# The Bull Case for ASML

**Let‚Äôs be real‚ÄîASML has basically been selling its tools at a discount.** It‚Äôs hands-down the most dominant player in the entire semiconductor game, with zero competition. Compare that to TSMC, which still has to keep an eye on Samsung, Intel, and maybe even Rapidus in advanced chipmaking. ARM has to watch out for RISC-V, Cadence and Synopsys are still duking it out, Nvidia‚Äôs losing some datacenter accelerator share to Broadcom and Marvell, and Analog Devices has to compete with Texas Instruments and Microchip in analog semis.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîthese companies are all in strong positions with solid growth prospects. But when it comes to a **true monopoly?** ASML is in a league of its own.

Now check this out‚ÄîTSMC has consistently outperformed ASML when it comes to gross margins. And honestly, it‚Äôs mostly the American companies that know how to squeeze every dollar out of a dominant position. ASML could‚Äôve been pulling in 60‚Äì65% gross margins like Nvidia has done in the past if they wanted to, but they‚Äôve been way too nice about pricing. Let‚Äôs face it‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt a business that should be settling for 50% gross margins.

https://preview.redd.it/ryfd39x68mbe1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed50e3ab62a6f1b4a2e77857294e9e92228741b6

# Conclusion

ASML is basically a bet on keeping Moore‚Äôs Law alive and pushing the scaling roadmap forward. Right now, the risk-reward balance still looks pretty good‚Äîmainly because TSMC and Intel are both making solid progress and have a clear game plan for the Angstrom era. Plus, their top-tier customers in high-performance computing are more than willing to shell out big bucks for the performance boosts these Angstrom chips deliver.

Looking at the current valuation, it‚Äôs actually pretty fair for what ASML‚Äôs got going on. Investors are basically paying the same kind of multiple they did six years ago‚Äîback when the outlook was just as strong as it is now and the stock absolutely skyrocketed.

2025-01-07,03:53:11,investing,Uber: A Great Buying Opportunity In Current Markets,"**Summary**

* Uber‚Äôs stock is currently undervalued due to market fears surrounding autonomous vehicles, but its robust fundamentals and durable business model make it a highly appealing investment.
* Key strengths include an extensive urban mobility database, loyal user base, and diversified sources of revenue.
* While the rise of self-driving technology presents certain risks, Uber‚Äôs strategic alliances, regulatory challenges for competitors, and market dominance ensure it remains well-positioned for sustained growth.
* Even cautious revenue and margin projections suggest considerable upside potential, making Uber an attractive choice with a strong margin of safety.

**The Impact of Market Narratives on Uber's Perception**

Recent announcements have reignited interest in autonomous driving. Tesla (TSLA) revealed plans to launch the Cybercab by 2027, while Google‚Äôs Waymo (GOOGL) announced expansion into Miami. These updates have led to a nearly 10% drop in Uber‚Äôs stock, contributing to a 15% decline over the past month.

This situation is reminiscent of past market narratives that impacted companies like Google and Meta (META). Both experienced temporary valuation drops due to overblown concerns but ultimately delivered strong returns, supported by solid fundamentals and competent management.

Uber continues to showcase impressive operational growth, strong cash flow, and consistent profitability, all while trading at historically low P/E multiples. These attributes, combined with its moat-driven business model, position Uber as a promising portfolio addition.

**Uber's Competitive Moats and the Importance of Strategic Management**

Uber‚Äôs advantages go beyond its network effects. Its unmatched urban mobility database allows for optimized routing, pricing, and seamless connections between users and drivers. Additionally, features like loyalty programs, subscriptions, and brand trust further enhance its competitive position in a sector where reliability and safety are crucial.

Diversification is another critical element in reducing risk. Similar to Google‚Äôs evolution beyond search, Uber has created a multifaceted platform that includes logistics and transportation. Delivery accounted for 30% of revenue in Q3, while freight contributed 11%, generating $1.3 billion despite not yet achieving positive EBITDA margins. These emerging segments have the potential to become significant revenue drivers in the future.

Furthermore, Uber‚Äôs investments in companies like Grab (GRAB) and DiDi (OTCPK:DIDIY) reflect a strategic approach to balancing profitability and competition. These equity stakes act as a form of optionality while demonstrating Uber‚Äôs ability to focus on long-term gains in key regions.

Uber‚Äôs management has shown remarkable capability in adapting to industry changes. Much like Meta‚Äôs successful redirection of investments, Uber is already positioning itself for the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Partnerships with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta exemplify its ability to integrate self-driving technology while retaining its platform leadership.

**Adapting to Regulations and Long-Term Mobility Trends**

The adoption of self-driving vehicles faces significant hurdles, including regulatory and infrastructure challenges, particularly in emerging markets that are critical to Uber‚Äôs business. While major cities like Los Angeles and Miami may adopt autonomous technology sooner, broader implementation is likely to take years, especially in regions such as Brazil, India, and Mexico.

In addition, overarching trends in urban mobility‚Äîincluding cost savings, easing traffic congestion, and the shift from ownership to access‚Äîsupport Uber‚Äôs long-term growth. Although the global ride-hailing market is already substantial, it remains underpenetrated in numerous regions, providing opportunities for continued expansion.

**Uber's Resilience Shines Even in Pessimistic Scenarios**

While autonomous vehicles pose potential risks, competition from local apps and evolving regulations may present more immediate challenges to Uber‚Äôs margins and market share. Nonetheless, analysts project Uber‚Äôs EPS to reach $4 by 2027 and $4.80 by 2028, resulting in P/E multiples of 15x and 12.8x, respectively.

Even under conservative assumptions, Uber‚Äôs revenue could exceed $74 billion by 2030, with margins reaching 11.5%. In a more optimistic outlook, margins of 17% would result in a P/E multiple around 10x, equating to an earnings yield of 10%‚Äîa compelling figure for a leader in a growing market.

Uber‚Äôs forward P/E and free-cash-flow multiples of 21.9x remain attractive given its growth trajectory and low current valuations. With management forecasting strong EBITDA growth and robust free-cash-flow conversion, Uber offers significant upside even if its market valuation remains steady.

**TLDR:** Uber‚Äôs long-term outlook remains favorable despite concerns over disruption from self-driving technology. Its diversified operations, strategic investments, and adaptability effectively mitigate potential risks. At its current valuation, Uber represents a strong investment opportunity with substantial potential for long-term shareholder returns.

2025-01-07,00:04:40,investing,This is why we dont buy Chinese stocks: US Dept of Defense Labels Tencent a military company ,"
From [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline?embedded-checkout=true):

The U.S. Department of Defense has added Tencent Holdings and CATL to its blacklist of companies allegedly linked to China's military, causing Tencent's U.S.-listed shares to drop nearly 10%. This move is part of the Pentagon's ""Section 1260H list,"" which now names 134 firms believed to support China's military-civil fusion strategy, where civilian tech is leveraged for military purposes.

Tencent, known for WeChat and major gaming investments, has denied the allegations and plans to work with U.S. authorities to clear up what it calls a misunderstanding. Similarly, CATL, a key supplier of EV batteries to Tesla, Ford, and BMW, refuted the claims, calling their inclusion a mistake and stating they have no involvement in military activities.

While the designation doesn't impose immediate sanctions, it signals increased risk for U.S. investors and partners. Companies previously added to this list, like DJI, have faced serious business disruptions, including bans and reputational hits.

Both Tencent and CATL are expected to challenge the decision, but this adds to the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. Investors should keep an eye on this situation as it could impact these stocks and broader U.S.-China market relations.

2025-01-06,19:04:38,investing,Tesla's Deliveries Disappoint: Time To Take Profits (Rating Downgrade),"**Summary**

* Tesla's stock remains overvalued despite disappointing vehicle delivery numbers and slowing growth.
* The surge in Tesla's stock price is driven by enthusiasm for AI advancements, Elon Musk's charisma, and Donald Trump's election victory rather than improvements in the company's core business fundamentals.
* At 126 times projected earnings, Tesla‚Äôs valuation is far higher than both industry peers and even Nvidia, making it increasingly difficult to justify its current price.
* The company's challenges, including declining deliveries, suggest that much of its upside potential has already been priced in.
* Investors should consider taking profits while the stock is trading at near-record highs.

Tesla‚Äôs stock has been riding a wave of unprecedented enthusiasm, with its price reaching all-time highs despite recently published delivery numbers that fell short of analysts' expectations. This discrepancy highlights a growing disconnect between Tesla‚Äôs market valuation and its actual performance. The company, once known for its relentless growth and innovation, delivered fewer cars in 2024 than in 2023, marking its first-ever year of declining deliveries. Despite this, Tesla‚Äôs stock price has surged by 63% in 2024, demonstrating how much investor sentiment rather than fundamental growth is driving its valuation.

In my October analysis, I discussed how Tesla‚Äôs slowing delivery growth and declining net income, despite aggressive price cuts, were becoming evident concerns. Even the highly anticipated robotaxi event failed to deliver the excitement that investors had hoped for, leading to a drop in the stock price at the time. While Tesla was already trading at a premium then, its valuation has only become more stretched in the months since.

The most recent data on Tesla‚Äôs deliveries reveals troubling trends. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company delivered 495,570 vehicles, falling short of the 512,300 deliveries expected by analysts. This shortfall contributed to a total of 1.79 million vehicles delivered for the year, a slight decline from the 1.81 million delivered in 2023. While the drop in deliveries may seem modest, it is significant as it breaks Tesla‚Äôs streak of consistent year-over-year growth, which had previously been a hallmark of its success. This is especially notable given the company‚Äôs reliance on vehicle sales for approximately 80% of its revenue. Without sustained growth in this area, the rationale for holding Tesla as a growth stock diminishes considerably.

From 2020 to 2023, Tesla experienced remarkable growth in deliveries, with annual numbers climbing steadily. However, 2024 marked a departure from this trend, with sales stagnating and then declining. Quarterly delivery figures also highlight the slowdown, with growth peaking in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently stalling. This lack of growth is especially concerning for a company that reinvests all earnings into future expansion rather than paying dividends to shareholders. Tesla‚Äôs business model hinges on its ability to grow continuously, and the absence of that growth undermines its investment appeal.

Despite these challenges, Tesla‚Äôs stock has soared, buoyed by investor excitement over its advancements in artificial intelligence, Elon Musk‚Äôs magnetic persona, and the political implications of Donald Trump‚Äôs recent election victory. Musk has repeatedly emphasized Tesla‚Äôs position as a leader in AI and robotics, which has further fueled optimism among investors. Additionally, Tesla‚Äôs stock experienced significant gains following the November election, with investors speculating that Trump‚Äôs administration might ease regulations related to self-driving technology. However, such regulatory changes would only be beneficial if Tesla achieves full autonomy, an ambitious milestone that remains elusive.

Tesla‚Äôs valuation underscores the risks of the current enthusiasm. The stock is now trading at an extraordinary 126 times projected earnings, a multiple that far exceeds even AI powerhouse Nvidia, which trades at around 42 times earnings. Comparisons with legacy automakers further highlight the disparity. Tesla‚Äôs market cap of $1.2 trillion is greater than that of the next 20 largest automakers combined, yet it delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than in 2023. This disconnect raises questions about whether Tesla‚Äôs valuation can be justified in the absence of tangible growth.

Tesla‚Äôs performance relative to Nvidia provides another perspective on the stock‚Äôs overvaluation. While both companies have benefited from their association with AI, Tesla‚Äôs stock has outperformed Nvidia‚Äôs despite facing significant headwinds in its core business. This suggests that investor enthusiasm for Tesla may be outpacing its actual achievements.

Although Tesla remains a leader in EV production and is recognized for its innovative technologies, including AI and robotics, these factors are already priced into the stock. The company‚Äôs market leadership positions it well to benefit from long-term trends in EV adoption, but its challenges in the short term, including declining deliveries and uncertain profitability from new ventures, make its current valuation appear precarious.

In conclusion, Tesla‚Äôs stock is trading at unsustainable levels given its recent performance. While the company‚Äôs technological advancements and market leadership are undeniable, its reliance on investor sentiment rather than business fundamentals makes it a risky investment at these prices. Taking profits now would allow investors to capitalize on the stock‚Äôs near-record highs while avoiding potential losses should the market reassess Tesla‚Äôs valuation. While the enthusiasm surrounding Tesla may persist in the short term, prudence suggests that this is an opportune moment to exit the position.

This week was a roller coaster. My account dropped as low as $127,242.76 before rebounding on Friday. I try not to check my account every day to avoid the temptation of panic selling. The volatility can be tough to watch, but I try to stay focused on the long-term prospects of my holdings.

When I had my cash available, I purchased more MSTR since it took a substantial dip. I lowered my cost average down to $417.78, which is a realized loss of 18.7%. I will continue adding to this position as long as it is lower than my cost average. I now hold 49.138 shares.

I am also going to explore write some covered calls against a few of my holdings. I do this in my retirement account regularly, but I haven't done it much in my brokerage account because of tax implications. I will post updates if I decide to do that. I would love to generate some extra cash to begin buying some non-tech stocks and diversify the portfolio. As many of you stated last week, I certainly felt the effects of not diversifying when the NASDAQ was hammered in the middle of the week. I like some of the ideas people proposed last week, and I have added them to my watch list. If you have any other ideas that look good for 2025, please let me know in the comments.

It's also becoming very tempting to sell my LUNR contracts. They are up 650% since I purchased them, but I am trying to hold them through the launch later this month. We will see if that actually happens, or I might sell off two of my contracts to lock in gains and let the other two ride.

Here's an overview of my holdings. The only change was adding more MSTR this week.

**Current Holdings:**  
\- QQQ: 101.714 shares worth $52,832.41  
\- AMZN: 101.565 shares worth $22,769.85  
\- MSTR: 49.138 shares worth $16,690.21  
\- PANW: 80 shares worth $14,660.00.  
\- NVDA: 100.374 shares worth $14,501.03  
\- LUNR Call: 4 contracts (March 2025, $6 strike) worth $6,300  
\- CRWD: 10.753 shares worth $3,860.54  
\- META: 3.867 shares worth $2,338.10  
\- TGTX Call: 3 contracts (February 2025, $37 strike) worth $429.00

2025-01-05,15:09:43,investing,Wealthfront/Apple HYSA vs Fidelity CMA,"I just spent hours reading too many Reddit threads and have completely overthought this. I planned to open a joint brokerage and Roth IRA account with Fidelity, and open a HYSA on Wealthfront, but then found out about Fidelity's CMA accounts and cannot decide which option to go with.

Wealthfronts UI is super appealing compared to Fidelity. I'm a new investor and Fidelity intimidates me a little bit. But since these will be set-it and forget-it accounts, I don't know how much weight I want to put into that since I don't plan on regularly using them. I am an Apple Card user and just found out about Apple's HYSA and think the UI point applies here as well.

I like the idea of using Fidelity so everything is simple and in one place. I've read about putting the money into FDLXX instead of SPAXX since it's state/local tax-exempt. Overall, the CMA seems like a really good option compared to a HYSA, I just don't understand it as much at the moment.

I'm not keen on rate chasing. I want simplicity and to automate/set and forget my investing/ savings. Right now I am with Chase and will probably keep my checking with them for the convenience of having a local branch (not opposed to using Fidelity or Weatlhfront for my checking account). So I just want something to pair with that to keep my life simple. Wanted to come here for thoughts and/or to have someone to tell me to stop overthinking and just pick one. Thank you. in advance, for any advice.",AAPL,Apple
2025-01-05,05:45:40,investing,What is everyone reading for business/stock news,"So as I learn more about investing I'm realizing there are a TON of websites giving different stories on companies etc. What are the top 10 websites that are giving the most trusted/accurate information? I would like them to be free but I understand some do charge for a subscription nowadays. 

Next before investing in a company what are we looking at?

\* 10Q?

\*Trends?

\*quarterly reports?

\*latest news and once again from what sites? I'm willing to read 12 hours a day. 

\*It's hard for me to determine what's making a stock news based of what information?

\*Like why is Warren Buffet in OXY and not Exxon mobile? I'd like to read and find out but I don't want to waste time of bad news providing websites. 

\*Does anyone look at the buys and sells of the day?

\*For example I watched Tesla fall about $30 the other day due to a report saying they sold less vehicles. Then the next day skyrocketed past the $30 loss.. How do you know for one the stock would skyrocket past the $30 mark and what trusted websites or news articles did you read when you found out they missed their sales mark?

  
Sorry I ask a lot of questions but I don't want to go into this blindly when it comes to buying and selling stocks. I also appreciate all the information about the kiddos, I think I'll be going into the 529.

2025-01-03,21:39:57,investing,2023 study: Your S&P 500 fund may be more actively managed than you're aware,"**TL;DR: S&P 500 funds can deviate significantly from the underlying S&P 500 index in how they hold and weight stocks, and may exclude stocks held in the index and/or include stocks not held in the index. These phenomena are more common in funds with lower assets under management, but are widespread to one degree or another.** 

I've been listening to Daniel Peris's podcast, which ran for 23 episodes from 2020-2023. He's a fund manager with Federated Hermes. 

In episode 18, he interviewed Adriana Robertson. She's a professor of law and finance at Yale. https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-18-big-user-of-index-funds-etfs-better-look/id1541649601?i=1000536213781

Robertson's research found many S&P 500 index funds or ETFs are much more active than people expect. To quote from the summary of a 2023 paper, co-written with Peter Molk of the University of Florida: 

>S&P 500 index funds do not typically commit, in a legally enforceable sense, to holding even a representative sample of the underlying index, nor do they commit to replicating the returns of that index. Managers therefore have the legal flexibility to depart substantially from the underlying index‚Äôs holdings. We also show that these departures are commonplace: S&P 500 index funds routinely depart from the underlying index by meaningful amounts, in both percentage and dollar terms. While these departures are largest among smaller funds, they are also present among mega-funds: even among the largest S&P 500 funds, holdings differ from the index by a total of between 1.7% and 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Across all S&P 500 funds, these deviations amounted to almost $61.5 billion in discretionary investment decisions.

Robertson and Molk describe the common perception, on page 4: 

>Academics, commentators, and the popular press widely assume that to track their underlying indices, index funds must robotically hold the assets of that index with, at most, minimal flexibility to deviate from the index‚Äôs holdings. 

However, that preconception is not necessarily accurate. 

>No law requires an index fund‚Äôs portfolio to match that of the underlying index, nor do index funds voluntarily assume this obligation through contract or other means (p. 5).  Discretionary investing by index funds is not confined to exotic strategies or funds that track bespoke [i.e., custom] indices. We show that even S&P 500 index funds, seen as the quintessential ‚Äúpassive‚Äù funds have significant flexibility to deviate from the index and exercise this flexibility on a regular, ongoing basis (p. 5)

They explain how things like redemptions and trading costs make it impossible to perfectly track an index. However, even after adjusting for these real-world contingencies there is more deviation from the index than is commonly believed. A close reading of the fine print for any given S&P 500 fund doesn't necessarily guarantee the fund with hold all the stocks in the S&P 500 index, nor in the same proportion as the index. One example, from page 20: 

>The Charles Schwab S&P 500 fund‚Äôs language states that it ‚Äúgenerally invests in stocks that are included in the S&P 500 Index‚Äù and that it ‚Äúgenerally will seek to replicate the performance of the index by giving the same weight to a given stock as the index does.‚Äù The language suggests a full replication approach, but it is hardly a commitment, nor does it require the fund even to buy shares in all 500 companies on the S&P 500. 

Robertson and Molk examined 78 S&P 500 mutual funds or ETFs, from Jan 2015 through Dec 2022. 

They go into some detail about about how S&P 500 funds often hold stocks that are not actually held in the S&P 500 index. Vanguard's S&P 500 funds holds Berkshire A shares (not part of the index) rather than Berkshire B (part of the index); the two stocks are closely but not perfectly correlated, which changes tracking error (see pages 37-38). Other examples include adding new stocks after they're announced but before they're formally added to the index (essentially front-running), keeping stocks in the fund past the deletion date (pp. 33-35), or keeping stocks associated with spin-offs that are not actually part of the S&P 500 (p 38). 

Smaller companies are more likely to be entirely eliminated from S&P 500 funds, probably to reduce transaction costs and because doing so is unlikely to materially alter returns (pp. 39-43). 

Stocks are more likely to be underweighted rather than over-weighted, due in part to the need of funds to hold cash: 

>Among the 633 companies comprising the S&P 500 during our observation period, 536 (85%) were on balance
underweighted by S&P 500 index funds during our sample period, while 69 (11%) were overweighted (p. 29).

ETFs are more likely to closely track the S&P 500's holdings, due in part to requirements to report holdings daily rather than quarterly for mutual funds (pp. 25-27).

In conclusion, the authors suggest that because index funds are less passive than believed, the net result is that index providers may effectively be functioning as undisclosed sub-advisors with raises legal and ethical questions. They note than in 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked for comment on this topic ""recognizing that index providers may be offering investment advice and not simply providing information"" (p. 56).

2025-01-03,04:20:49,investing,Do you have a stop loss strategy with long term investments?,"I will start with, I don't have one but wonder if I should.

For example, I have been accumulating Apple stock for years, so long my cost basis is still under $27. That said, I have always just viewed this a stock I accumulate and old since it has always been solid. Of course on on days like today, where it dips 2.6% and has trended down from highs closer to $260 I start to wonder if I would be better off using stop losses to sell and rebuy later.

I have always read that statistically people trying to time the market would tend to lose out because they sold out of the high and rebought out of the low.

2025-01-01,08:36:43,investing,Bitcoin Isn‚Äôt Unique But Infinite‚Äî$100K Is Beyond Absurd,"Imagine this: air, the most abundant and freely available resource on Earth. Everyone can breathe it without restriction, it‚Äôs everywhere, and it costs nothing. Now, imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles, claiming, ‚ÄúOnly 21 million bottles will ever exist.‚Äù They sell the bottles, marketing them as rare and special, and soon, the price of a single bottle soars to $100,000.

But here‚Äôs the catch: anyone can grab the same air, bottle it themselves, impose their own arbitrary limits, and sell it too. The air inside these bottles is identical, same purity, same ability to sustain life. Yet somehow, the original company convinces people their air is unique, while the others are dismissed as worthless. This isn‚Äôt just absurd but comically irrational. And yet, it‚Äôs a perfect analogy for Bitcoin.

Think about it: bottling air to sell is ridiculous. Why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available? Worse, imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system‚Äîone consuming massive amounts of electricity, requiring complex networks, and involving global participants‚Äîto package, transfer, and store this bottled air. This is the level of absurdity we reach with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin‚Äôs defenders often point to its decentralization, anonymity, and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. But what is this decentralized system really securing? Digital air. The units being produced, transferred, and protected represent nothing‚Äîthey are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. Anyone with the technical knowledge can clone Bitcoin‚Äôs code, impose their own arbitrary cap, and launch their own cryptocurrency.

This brings us to the critical difference between Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies: cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless.

Stocks represent ownership in a company. A company cannot be copied like a piece of code. The value of a share is tied to the performance, assets, and operations of that unique entity. You cannot clone Tesla or Apple, and therefore, you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. Stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite, tied to real-world assets, operations, and innovation.

Fiat currencies, on the other hand, represent units of debt. They are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers‚Äîcompanies, governments, or individuals‚Äîto repay them. Banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real-world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. No one can walk into a bank and request a trillion-dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it.

Cryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. If you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow, nothing stops you. Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the Bitcoin protocol, adjust the parameters, and produce trillions of coins in their own system. In this way, cryptocurrencies represent nothing‚Äîno ownership, no debt, no tangible connection to the real economy. They are the digital equivalent of bottling air, infinitely replicable with no inherent value.

Bitcoin‚Äôs defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable, likening it to gold. But unlike gold, Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity is artificial and replicable. Limiting Bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only producing 21 million bottles.‚Äù The air is still abundant, and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits.

The absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing, transferring, and storing these digital tokens. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations, and yet what is being protected? A digital representation of air, something freely available, infinitely replicable, and ultimately meaningless.

Bitcoin‚Äôs price doesn‚Äôt reflect the value of its features. If decentralization, anonymity, and security were truly valuable, Bitcoin‚Äôs clones, many of which improve on these features, would share its valuation. Instead, Bitcoin‚Äôs price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. People aren‚Äôt paying $100,000 because Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency; they‚Äôre paying because they believe someone else will pay more.

This speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin‚Äôs features are infinitely replicable, and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost, the illusion will collapse.

Bitcoin isn‚Äôt digital gold, nor is it a revolutionary asset. It‚Äôs a digital air, packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. Paying $100,000 for a single Bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. The elaborate decentralized system supporting Bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost.

When the hype fades, and the absurdity of the system becomes clear, Bitcoin‚Äôs price will plummet, leaving behind the inescapable truth: no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.",TSLA,Tesla

This speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin‚Äôs features are infinitely replicable, and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost, the illusion will collapse.

Bitcoin isn‚Äôt digital gold, nor is it a revolutionary asset. It‚Äôs a digital air, packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. Paying $100,000 for a single Bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. The elaborate decentralized system supporting Bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost.

When the hype fades, and the absurdity of the system becomes clear, Bitcoin‚Äôs price will plummet, leaving behind the inescapable truth: no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.",AAPL,Apple

2024-12-31,17:30:46,investing,DCA into SPY by selling puts? 250k never traded options before.,"Hi guys, I will try to give context to my whole situation while also keeping it brief.

After all income minus expenses (mortgage, other) I have a surplus of about 2-3k a month that I just collect in my bank. For the past few years it was just rotting in my BOA account, but recently I moved it to Robinhood so it atleast gets 4% now.

A few years ago I put 50k in GTE, sold it when it hit 65k. Had to pay taxes on the 15k. Then put the 65k into SDC. DCA‚Äôd when stock fell in half and put in another 50k. SDC went bankrupt so I lost 115k. Would be nice if I could tax harvest it some how.

Also this whole time I was not putting any money into 401k or Roth. A month ago filled up my Roth for the Robinhood bonus, and will deposit another 7k in a few days. And a few days ago I finally went to my HR portal and enabled max 401k. Why it took me this long, I don‚Äôt know.

Anyways, I already made every possible financial mistake, so I was just trying to make the final biggest one of all. Timing the market. That is why I let my savings balloon to 250k (even after the SDC loss) .

But I just read somewhere that selling puts of SPY is like DCA‚Äôing plus you also get paid a premium.

As you can see, I am very financially illiterate, I‚Äôve never traded options before, although I do have a Robinhood account, and I‚Äôm smart enough to know how to have a good job that pay wells. Can someone help me walk through this?

I understand that when I enter a contract to sell puts, I buy 100 shares of that stock at the current price. If the shares go up I am mandated to sell these shares at that price I bought them, and the buyer can take those shares and instantly sell them for the higher price. 

If the stock goes down however, than my option expires worthless, but I don‚Äôt care because I was hoping for that to happen if my goal was to DCA into SPY. I already bought the 100 shares. I just got paid the premium for giving someone an option to speculate on them.

I have a couple of questions, first when doing this option, is there a particularly security to choose? Like SPY or VOO or SPLG or just the stocks I want to invest in like, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google.

For example, I noticed SPY has a ton of dates for selling puts, whereas SPLG only has 5 possible dates, roughly 2-3 months apart.

My goal is to maximize bid price right? The lower you try to sell the put for, usually the lower the bid price. 
Also if I try to sell a put that expires in a few days, usually the bid price is a few dollars. A month away, it goes up to $10. But two months away, it doesn‚Äôt double to $20, it goes to around $12-$14. So that is why the most optimal puts are to buy the ones that are a month away. Because you collect the premium and can choose to invest into selling more puts again more quickly (if stock went up).

Should I try to care about limit order or market order?

Right now I‚Äôm looking at SPY, the current price is $588.70, and there is a put for $588 on Feb 21st with a bid price of $10.21

So irregardless, I make $1,021. If stock goes down, I was planning to DCA into SPY, so now I own 100 shares. If stock goes up, someone else makes more money. Since I have 250k, I can do this trade 4 times, and at the end of February, I either have 250k plus 4k, or I have 400 shares of SPY

I guess now the question becomes how do I maximize the bid price while not doing something crazy? What is the best strategy for this?

Plus I kinda do still believe in timing the market a little. I feel like there might be a sharp drop around end of Jan (Trump) and then we will probably trend downwards or sideways for a year or so. I‚Äôm curious if you guys agree or disagree or what are your market predictions. I feel like recession sentiment is growing, but I don't know how that correlates to an actual recession.",AAPL,Apple

I am a longtime lurker, but I am hopeful people may feel inspired by financial journey over the last year or so.   
  
For background, I‚Äôm an assistant principal at a local elementary school, and my wife runs her own tutoring and education consulting business. Together, we‚Äôve been focused on building a secure financial future while balancing busy lives. This post is part of my ongoing journey of consistent investing. As of November 13, 2023, I began contributing $1,000 weekly to my brokerage account. Previously, I had dabbled in investing since 2021 but without consistency.  I deposited a little extra money here and there, but I wasn't consistent in my approach and didn't prioritize it. This is my story and an update on where I stand today.

**Portfolio Snapshot as of December 2024:**  
  
Starting Balance (November 13, 2023): $44,403.12  
Current Balance (December 26, 2024): $131,615.84

**Monthly Contributions:** $4,000 - $5,000 (depending on the number of weeks per month)

**Current Holdings:**  
\- QQQ: 101.714 shares worth $53,151.66  
\- AMZN: 101.565 shares worth $22,725.16

**Lessons Learned:**

\- **Compounding Takes Time but Works:** I‚Äôve started noticing compounding effects really kick in. Some months, my portfolio‚Äôs growth outpaced my monthly salary, which is both surreal and inspiring.

\- **Volatility is Real:** Watching significant swings in my portfolio value is tough. To manage this, I‚Äôve adopted a ""set it and forget it"" mindset and avoid checking my account daily.

**- Stay Consistent:** It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in market trends and daily life, but staying consistent with contributions has been the most rewarding strategy.

**Why I‚Äôm Sharing:**

I hope to inspire others who might be hesitant about investing. I realize $1,000 isn't possible for everyone - I'm extremely lucky to be able to do this - but I think starting with even $50 a week or a month can be impactful. Financial independence is achievable with consistency, discipline, and patience. 

For transparency, I focus solely on my brokerage account in these posts, even though I also fully fund my Roth IRA, 403(b), and my wife‚Äôs self-directed 401(k). We also maintain a hands-off Acorns account with about $60,000. I‚Äôve thought about moving that money to Fidelity but appreciate the safety and simplicity it offers.

**Looking Ahead:**

Starting in January, I plan to post each week to give a closer look at my journey. I‚Äôll share more details on my strategy and lessons as they unfold.

If you have questions about my approach, portfolio, or anything else, feel free to ask! Thanks for following along, and good luck on your own investing journeys!",NVDA,NVIDIA
2024-12-28,21:03:52,investing,How to invest in broad market minus a few stocks?,"Most of my money's in index funds, but there are a few stocks that I don't believe are worth paying for.

I pretty much want an index fund like VOO minus a few stocks such as APPL, TSLA, MSTR (especially TSLA and MSTR). Idealy a financial institution would provide a bunch (500+) check boxes for each compaany (sorted by market cap) where by default it buys the same fraction of each stock.

Essentially I want to create a custom index fund where my custom fund has almost every notable company in the USA or the world. I like being lazy and do not want to buy 500+ stocks ever time I get a paycheck.

From googling around there are services that offer something called ""direct indexing"" but I don't see why buying / selling a market proportional ammount should cost 0.4% / year. I also do not understand why there would need to be ""rebalancing"" since ETFs such as VOO own (throwing out a number) 5% of everything and buy / sell as people buy / sell the ETF.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-12-28,17:02:12,investing,The New Normal in Asset Valuation,"With a ‚Äúslight‚Äù delay, I finally watched¬†*The Big Short*. Highly recommend it‚Äîexcellent movie.

It got me thinking about how much the world has changed in the past 15 years. The 2007-2008 crisis was all about financiers selling bad products as good ones‚Äîuntil reality broke through the glitter, and the bubble burst. The protagonist of the film bet against the system as soon as he realized the product was fundamentally flawed. And he relatively easily waited for the explosion to occur. Truth prevailed quickly.

Now, things are completely different. We‚Äôve been living in a well-known, yet unpopped bubble for years. Take Apple, for instance. It‚Äôs objectively a very good company. I like their products, I buy the new iPhone and AirPods, and I even own some of their shares. I‚Äôm by no means saying it‚Äôs a bad investment. But let‚Äôs examine it the way Burry and his colleagues looked at bonds‚Äîasking, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs really behind that AAA rating?‚Äù

It‚Äôs much easier for us now than it was for them. For our ‚Äúinvestigation,‚Äù there‚Äôs no need to talk to exotic dancers or drive through dusty backwaters. Everything is right there in the public reports. The most basic figures, clear as day, show that today‚Äôs Apple is not a stock of future growth. It‚Äôs a classic cash cow: stable, profitable, but not growing. Adjusted for inflation, it‚Äôs actually a shrinking business. Net profit? $100 billion a year. Nearly all of it, with some extra, is distributed as dividends and buybacks. The company hasn‚Äôt released a genuinely successful new product in 10 years. Antitrust regulators aren‚Äôt fond of it. There‚Äôs no sign of explosive growth ahead, but the risk of a sharp decline exists.

What‚Äôs such a business objectively worth? Strictly less than a ‚Äúrisk-free‚Äù U.S. Treasury bond yielding $100 billion in coupons annually. How much less? You could write two volumes debating how to assess business risks. But it‚Äôs less‚Äîrisk compared to no risk at the same yield. (Yes, U.S. Treasuries have risk too, but if ‚Äúthe dollar collapses,‚Äù the government would likely tax Apple into oblivion first.)

The 30-year bond we need costs $2.2 trillion today. Apple? $3.4 trillion. That‚Äôs an extra trillion right there. A trillion, Carl! The hole in 2007 was larger, but even then, a trillion would‚Äôve been noticeable in the context of the entire crisis. And here I picked just one company, almost at random, and it‚Äôs a good company.

Everyone sees this; all the numbers are public. I haven‚Äôt discovered America here. Tons of independent analysts and experts predict a global crash based on similar logic‚Äîexactly like Burry once did. Many people believe them year after year, short the market, and lose money doing it. Meanwhile, the market keeps climbing, and whether it will actually collapse someday, nobody knows. For now, everything‚Äôs steadily growing; the pandemic records have long been surpassed. This isn‚Äôt 2007. Reality no longer breaks through the glitter.",AAPL,Apple

2024-12-23,20:20:19,investing,"27 year old, looking to bring more structure to my equity investing","Hi all, 

27M here. Have been investing in equities since 2018, with the majority in SPY, and a few select single names here and there. I've recently started dabbling in options, and want to get some advice on (i) Am I pursuing the right strategies for my profile, and (ii) How to bring more structure to my stock picking.

For context, have \~$300K liquid assets, \~$78K of which is in a Schwab account and the rest in a HYSA (not including money in my checking for daily living expenses/rent/etc.). Am currently in an MBA program that is being paid for by my employer, so don't need to worry about tuition, but obviously don't have a salary right now. My employer had a strict trading policy - ETFs / indices only, no single names due to MNPI concerns. Hence why I've only been able to take on a more active approach to investing in the 2nd half of 2024. 

My investing basically follows 4 strategies:

1. SPY - \~60% of portfolio

2. A couple stocks that I think are great companies *qualitatively*, mostly from a consumer standpoint (e.g., Amex, Costco) - \~8% of portfolio

3. Growth and meme stocks that I see a lot of buzz about on Reddit and other social media (NVDA, MSTR, RKLB, KULR, MVST, TLRY) - \~25% of portfolio

4. Selling covered calls on some of the above - anywhere between 30-180 DTE, at strike prices I'd be comfortable taking profit

The rest is sitting in cash in my brokerage (need to figure out where to deploy this). 

I'm looking for stock screening criteria that I can apply to potential investments. The list I have in my head so far is something like (i) Positive and growing revenue (even better if profitable); (ii) Low P/E ratio relative to competitors; (iii) Some positive dividend yield but not more than a few percentage points; (iv) Consensus analyst rating of Buy, or Hold if I really believe in the company. 

Do the above criteria look right / are there any big ones I should add? At my age, I consider myself growth investor, although that's tempered somewhat by my innate risk aversion. Although I know what my job and income will be in 2 years, I'm not looking to lose all my money lol. Thanks everyone!",NVDA,NVIDIA
2024-12-23,17:12:33,investing,"When Tech Eventually Fizzles, Will U.S. Continue to Dominate? Backtesting Excluding Tech vs. Global Markets","Edit: People are misunderstanding the question. I‚Äôm not bearish on tech. It‚Äôs more of a question of US continuing to out perform the global market once the expected returns on tech slows.

TL;DR: As tech‚Äôs strong performance fades (maybe it doesn‚Äôt, but eventually, it might), why should we believe the U.S. market will continue to outperform globally? Has anyone already backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech‚Äîespecially the ‚ÄúMagnificent 7‚Äù‚Äîand compared its performance to developed and emerging markets?

Over the past 15 years, the U.S. market has massively outperformed global equities, leading to the narrative that U.S. governance, monetary policy, the strength of the dollar (as the global reserve currency), and favorable geopolitical conditions will continue to support this dominance. This view is widely accepted in this community (you can find tons of discussions on this by searching ‚Äúinternational‚Äù here if you haven‚Äôt already).

However, the primary driver of U.S. outperformance has been the tech sector, particularly the ‚ÄúMagnificent 7‚Äù (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta). A quick search shows that these companies have been responsible for a significant portion of U.S. market returns over the past two decades, with tech alone contributing heavily to the growth of the S&P 500.

But what happens when the tech sector eventually hits a slowdown or correction? While it could continue to dominate for another decade, at some point, the market may shift, and another sector or region could rise to prominence. So, if tech (especially the Magnificent 7) loses its edge, what is left to support U.S. market dominance?

I‚Äôm particularly interested in whether anyone has backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech stocks (especially the MAG 7) and compared its performance against global markets‚Äîboth developed and emerging. Excluding the top tech names from the S&P 500 could provide a more realistic view of the underlying market performance without the distortion caused by these mega-cap stocks, which are arguably overvalued or at least priced for significant future growth.

I‚Äôm asking this because, as a long-term, passive investor, I think the MAG 7 may be overvalued, and their strong returns over the past 15 years might not be sustainable. To further diversify my portfolio, I‚Äôve begun investing in US mid and small-cap S&P funds, but I‚Äôm also looking to increase my exposure to global equities.

2024-12-23,17:12:33,investing,"When Tech Eventually Fizzles, Will U.S. Continue to Dominate? Backtesting Excluding Tech vs. Global Markets","Edit: People are misunderstanding the question. I‚Äôm not bearish on tech. It‚Äôs more of a question of US continuing to out perform the global market once the expected returns on tech slows.

TL;DR: As tech‚Äôs strong performance fades (maybe it doesn‚Äôt, but eventually, it might), why should we believe the U.S. market will continue to outperform globally? Has anyone already backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech‚Äîespecially the ‚ÄúMagnificent 7‚Äù‚Äîand compared its performance to developed and emerging markets?

Over the past 15 years, the U.S. market has massively outperformed global equities, leading to the narrative that U.S. governance, monetary policy, the strength of the dollar (as the global reserve currency), and favorable geopolitical conditions will continue to support this dominance. This view is widely accepted in this community (you can find tons of discussions on this by searching ‚Äúinternational‚Äù here if you haven‚Äôt already).

However, the primary driver of U.S. outperformance has been the tech sector, particularly the ‚ÄúMagnificent 7‚Äù (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta). A quick search shows that these companies have been responsible for a significant portion of U.S. market returns over the past two decades, with tech alone contributing heavily to the growth of the S&P 500.

But what happens when the tech sector eventually hits a slowdown or correction? While it could continue to dominate for another decade, at some point, the market may shift, and another sector or region could rise to prominence. So, if tech (especially the Magnificent 7) loses its edge, what is left to support U.S. market dominance?

I‚Äôm particularly interested in whether anyone has backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech stocks (especially the MAG 7) and compared its performance against global markets‚Äîboth developed and emerging. Excluding the top tech names from the S&P 500 could provide a more realistic view of the underlying market performance without the distortion caused by these mega-cap stocks, which are arguably overvalued or at least priced for significant future growth.

I‚Äôm asking this because, as a long-term, passive investor, I think the MAG 7 may be overvalued, and their strong returns over the past 15 years might not be sustainable. To further diversify my portfolio, I‚Äôve begun investing in US mid and small-cap S&P funds, but I‚Äôm also looking to increase my exposure to global equities.

2024-12-21,19:43:32,investing,Is there a point in investing in emerging markets?,"Many people invest in emerging markets with the rationale that these countries have a huge growth potential. But my rationale says that even if these economies grow, it's the companies from the developed world that will benefit the most. For example, as poor countries gain more disposable incomes, they'll be able to buy more expensive products like iPhones and MacBooks. So this will help the Apple stock grow not the stock of some company in these emerging economies. That's not to say those companies won't grow at all, sure they will with increased internal demand, but the developed world has more to gain from the growth of the emerging economies. Also, most internal growth will come from international companies opening their manufacturing plants in emerging economies like Apple and Samsung manufacturing in India. So again it only makes sense to invest in developed world.

2024-12-20,19:18:36,investing,"Every Monday morning I invest $1,885. Here is how I divvy it up, can y'all provide feedback/opinions on my investing strategy please?","I'm an early 30s single guy with a solid income. I invest $1885.00 every week which amounts to roughly half of my take home pay, and I live off the other half.

I live in a very high cost of living city and I rent an apartment. I've got a very long time horizon so I'm trying to be aggressive.

Here is how I divvy my money:

Stock | Amount Invested | Percentage of investment
:--|:--:|--:
S&P 500 ETF (VOO) | $700 | 37.14%
NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) | $400 | 21.22%
MAG 6 (no Tesla) | $180 ($30 each) | 9.55%
Small Caps (AVUV) | $120 | 6.37%
Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) | $100 | 5.30%
Financial Sector ETFs (XLF and IAI) * | $80 ($40 each) | 4.244%
Semiconductors ETF (SMH) | $80 | 4.244%
Individual Stock Picks I like (15 in total, listed below) ** | $225 ($15 each) | 11.94%
**TOTAL** | $1885 | 100%

*The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc..., whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schwab, S&P Global etc... There is only a 15% overlap between these two ETFs.

**The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are: Adobe (ADBE), AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Chipotle (CMG), Salesforce (CRM), Door Dash (DASH), Netflix (NFLX), ServiceNow (NOW), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Palantir (PLTR), Shopify (SHOP), Sofi Bank (SOFI), Uber (UBER)

---

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

I'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).

LVMH 3.6%

All of this are at decent gains, except for DELL which is currently at a -27% loss and I am planning to cut it entirely. IONQ obviously has achieved an extreme gain and I am aware of the concentration risk. I have a price in mind at which I will trim some profit, but I am comfortable with the risk of seeing my portfolio volatility spiking up just because of that position.

In addition to the above holdings and outside of my trading account, I have another 10% in my banking account and I am saving for a mortgage deposit over the next year. Pension contribution is sorted out and my income and earning potential are decent enough to afford the investment risk of my portfolio. 

QQQ and IWQU are the two long term holdings that I am building; I plan to increase these two over time with further contributions and gains from other positions.

CASH is there for buying opportunities if the market dips at any point.

SAVING DEPOSIT might be invested or transferred to my bank account for the mortgage deposit.

I'd like to have your opinion for what I am planning to do with my holdings. I am thinking of the following alternatives:

- sell DELL and LVMH and invest everything in QQQ and IWQU with a 70/30 split
- sell DELL, keep some in CASH, invest the rest in other high risks names that I have been following. 

The reason of these two alternatives is that I prefer not to touch IONQ because it has the potential to generate a life changing wealth, but if I lose it all I am okay with it, and as such I'd rather raise cash from a low growth holding (DELL) and from LVMH that might still grow but I am okay with the profit that I made so far.

I am looking at the evolution of the Semiconductors, hence why I am not touching SMH. I think that the sector has more room to run in 2025, but it will be the next one to liquidate and move to my two long term holdings.

2024-12-17,01:24:17,investing,Ponzi Spotting: a laymen's guide to differentiating investments from Ponzi schemes,"I often see things being called Ponzi schemes on Reddit that are very much not Ponzi schemes. Usually, it always stems from the criticism that a particular investment only goes up in price because someone newer is paying a higher price for it. Hence, it must be a Ponzi.

I‚Äôm going to blow your minds a little bit.¬†

Almost all (legitimate) investments require new investors willing to pay a higher price for older investors to cash out a profit.¬†

Most investable objects, REGARDLESS of what underlies the object, trade at a price on a market. This means, at the margin, some percentage (usually only a small percentage) of the total available supply of the object is trading hands. The trade is priced typically in your local fiat currency, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. Prices are determined by supply and demand. When an investable object goes up in price on a market, it means there were no sellers of the object at the lower price, and price goes up until the next marginal seller decides they are willing to part with that object at the higher price.¬†

The use of the term investable object is intentionally left extremely broad. It essentially means anything quantifiable that can be owned and traded. This includes contracts, stocks, bonds, physical objects, digital objects, etc.¬†

**Example 1.** You bought a 1st edition charizard for 20 dollars when it came out in the 1990‚Äôs. Since it was relatively abundant (still being printed by the company) and Pokemon was relatively new at the time, the supply was high and the demand was low. Fast forward 30 years, Pokemon is super popular and there are very few 1st edition charizards remaining (out of print for decades, many were lost or destroyed through the years). You now are able to sell the charizard for 10,000 dollars to a guy that just got into Pokemon card collecting. Congratulations, you bought low and sold high! Was what you participated in a Ponzi scheme because you (an old investor) made a profit by selling to a new investor?

I really hope your answer to this is no. If you think the answer is yes, you can stop reading here, because I don‚Äôt think anything I‚Äôm going to say beyond this point is going to help you.

The next step in logic is realizing this charizard example is essentially how ALL INVESTMENT RETURNS are made when the investable object at hand is not providing a direct flow of cash. This is true for non-dividend (which is the vast majority) stocks, derivatives, physical collectibles like pet rocks/beanie babies/tulip bulbs, and digital collectibles like in-game skins/NFTs/cryptocurrencies, etc. Examples of cash flowing investments would be dividend stocks, direct ownership of small businesses such that net profits are available to you, or rental properties. It is important to note while ultimately supply and demand determine if a price for an investable object goes up over time, the underlying reason an investable object has demand at all can be wildly different from object to object. The reason some people want first edition charizards is usually a very different reason people want to own a stock of a company. It is within the eye of the investor to decide if the reason is a good reason, and hopefully a reason that leads to increased demand in the future.

So, what is a Ponzi? According to ChatGPT, a Ponzi scheme is ‚Äúa fraudulent investment scam that promises high returns with little or no risk to investors. The scheme relies on using the funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors, rather than generating legitimate profit from actual investments or business activities. Eventually, the scheme collapses when it becomes impossible to recruit enough new investors or when too many existing investors try to withdraw their money at the same time.‚Äù

That seems like a pretty good definition to me! The part that everyone focuses on when thinking about a Ponzi is this part: ‚Äúthe scheme relies on using funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors.‚Äù This sounds extremely similar to my charizard example, yet I hope you have the intellectual honesty to accept that a real Ponzi scheme is different from buying low and selling high.¬†

The part that is extremely important, in addition to old investor returns being funded by new investors, is that the scheme PROMISES a return. The reality is that many Ponzi schemes do not start off as Ponzi schemes. There are sometimes investment funds that partake briefly in Ponzi-like behavior to paper over potential insolvency during a downturn, and then return to legitimate investment activities when the market improves. Doing this is quite risky and is still illegal, because if you aren‚Äôt able to essentially over deliver (and underpromise) on future returns to even things out, you‚Äôre essentially stuck in an endless cycle of repaying old investors who cash out with newer investor money, turning your once legitimate investment fund into a Ponzi scheme. The right move is to always be open and honest about what returns you‚Äôre able to achieve for your investors to avoid being stuck in the Ponzi-loop I described.¬†

Another attribute of Ponzi schemes is that Ponzi‚Äôs almost always violently collapse once the perceived value of the fund goes down. This is because once a Ponzi stops attracting new money, it becomes apparent very quickly that the liabilities of the fund far outstrip the assets.¬†

**Example 2.** Imagine a hypothetical Ponzi scheme. The Ponzi fund initially accepted $1,000 dollars from 10 eager investors in a local town. The fund manager promises a 10% annual yield so that in 1 year‚Äôs time, any of the original investors can withdraw $1,100, if they so please. Unfortunately, our manager really sucks at operating this Ponzi, and after 1 year, obtains exactly zero new clients. His liabilities at the end of the year are now $11,000, but he only has $10,000 of cash on hand. Even more unfortunately for him, Taylor Swift is announced to be coming to town and tickets are on sale now, and the tickets incidentally cost $1,100. All his investors want to cash out immediately so they ask for their money back. The first 9 that come to him are able to get their money back ($1,100 x 9 = $9,900). When the 10th person comes back, he realizes there‚Äôs only $100 for him, not the $1,100 he was promised! The fund not only has basically no money left, it owes $1000. The 10th person notifies the police, and our unfortunate fund manager is arrested for fraud.¬†

I will note that in this example, this scheme required 90% of the investors to withdraw for the scheme to collapse, but examples in history tend to be much more skewed, where even a small withdrawal of 1-5% of investors can completely collapse the scheme.

Returning to the investable object definition, once a Ponzi runs out of new investors to pay prior investors, the investable object completely disappears because the fund you thought was flush with desirable investable objects (that could be sold on an open market for hopefully higher than you originally paid for) actually had a negative cash balance the entire time! Behind the curtain, there actually was no object at all. This is in contrast to our buy low sell high example with the charizard card. The charizard market could hypothetically collapse tomorrow such that the market price drops from $10,000 to $1. Maybe everyone collectively realizes Pokemon is super lame, and that Yugioh is the superior card game. At the end of the day, there are two truths: you still own the investable object aka the charizard, and no one promised you a return for owning it. You can always wait it out, hoping that people become interested in charizards (and Pokemon) again.¬†

I hope this somewhat lengthy piece was helpful in elucidating Ponzi schemes for anyone that read this far. I often see CLEARLY non-Ponzi investable objects being echo-chambered as Ponzi‚Äôs on Reddit, when it really stems from a misunderstanding of the investable object, or the mechanics of investment itself. If your investable object trades on an open market, and nominal gains are made through price increases due to supply and demand dynamics, it is almost certainly not a Ponzi. If nobody is promising you a return, it also probably isn‚Äôt a Ponzi. This does not mean your investable object itself is not a scam or a bubble. That determination should be made with your best judgment of the fundamentals that underlie the object itself. I will leave you with 2 final examples to illustrate this.¬†

**Example 3.** Tesla stock is neither a Ponzi (trades on open market) nor a scam (they actually sell cars, batteries, etc for a profit). It might be a bubble if you think the company‚Äôs market cap is too high for what its future profits will be.

**Example 4.** Nikola stock is not a Ponzi (stock traded on open market), but it was a scam. The CEO lied to investors about how functional the cars were (they weren‚Äôt), and how many they sold (pretty much zero).",TSLA,Tesla
2024-12-16,21:02:39,investing,"Reminder: If You Trade More, Wall Street Makes More Money","I've spent a few years reading Warren Buffett and other value investors. Essentially what I learned is that they make money by other people pushing prices too high or too low. Especially when prices become too low, they swoop in and buy a bunch. Next they sit on it a few years until the price goes to the correct valuation again, or preferably after many years when the company deteriorates.

Time and time again, people have predicted that Buffett's strategy will eventually stop working. We nowadays can learn much more etc etc.

Yet, stock prices are all over the place. Tesla doubled in the last 3 months for example. How is that possible? How can a 1T dollar company double in value in 3 months? They still build the same stuff with roughly the same people. Similar for Bitcoin. Also almost doubled in a few months. If that was inevitable according to some metric, then why was it not priced in?

At the same time, there is a common sentiment online that the world is becoming more and more unequal. More wealth accumulates in the hands of a few people.

So let me say this: if you are currently considering buying into some stock that went up recently, please let me remind you that there is only one party that will always make money from your trade. It's not you. It's your broker/Wall Street. They don't care whether you make money or lose money. Some will slam ""price targets"" on stocks if that makes you trade. Some will call other stocks ""uninvestible"" if that makes you trade.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-12-16,20:27:44,investing,Achieved my first milestone after 3 years!,"After 3 years of investing, I've finally achieved my goal of investing my first $100,000! This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*

I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. 

**Investment strategy:**

1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  
2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  
3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  
4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*

I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.

**Looking forward:**

Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!

My next goal will be to reach $300,000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think? Achievable?",NVDA,NVIDIA

I have about 40K in savings right now. Here is the breakdown:

33K in a HYS (3.8 APY)

6K in a different HYS (6.5 APY but I can only add 2K per month so I have an automatic transfer from the 3.8 account into this one. Every year the money all gets kicked out in August so it's a constant cycle)

$750 initially invested right now (650 in VTI/VOO ETFS - 100 in Tesla Stock)

I have about 13k in retirement as well (70% low risk 30% moderate risk)

Should I have more of my money invested into S&P ETFs that would likely outpace the 3.9 HYS? What do you think my diversity should be between all of these options? Are there other options I should look into?",TSLA,Tesla
2024-12-16,19:11:44,investing,$AVGO Analysis [DD]  ----,"Broadcom(AVGO)

This ticker is surfing multiple growth waves, including the AI boom, 5G rollout, and enterprise software takeover. My research reflects a top-tier supplier of custom chips powering cloud titans like AWS and Google Cloud, and its recent $61 billion VMware acquisition just opened a fat new cash spigot with juicy profit margins. With AI and 5G still in the early innings, Broadcoms got a serious baller vibe rn.

Financially, Broadcom is a cash cow. Were talking monster gross margins at 75% and a cash-printing machine generating around $16 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Dividends are popping off, up 24% annually over five years, and the current yield at 2.3% isnt too shabby for a growth beast.

On valuation, this stock looks like a steal. Trading at \~20x forward earnings, its way cheaper than high-flyers like NVIDIA, despite packing serious growth potential. Analysts are eyeing the $1,000+ zone for the stock in the next few years, which spells a tasty upside from here.

The risks? Regulatory heat and a macro slowdown could throw some shade, but Broadcoms diversified playbook spreads the risk nicely.

TL;DR: Broadcom is a money-printing machine crushing it in semis and software. With AI, 5G, and VMware in its corner, this one‚Äôs a no-brainer. Slap a $950 short-term target on it, and long-term, its got legs to hit $1,200+.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):**¬†\+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):**¬†\+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after¬†dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I‚Äôd like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a¬†[previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/).¬†**TL;DR:**

>‚Äú‚Ä¶AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn‚Äôt make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it‚Äôs the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what‚Äôs coming thanks to NVIDIA‚Äôs CUDA (moat), among¬†[other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).‚Äù

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is¬†[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)¬†and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software¬†easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we‚Äôve barely scratched the surface of AI‚Äôs opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)¬†I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I‚Äôm still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

2024-12-16,15:08:16,investing,2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a¬†self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):**¬†\+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):**¬†\+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after¬†dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I‚Äôd like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is¬†[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)¬†and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software¬†easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we‚Äôve barely scratched the surface of AI‚Äôs opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)¬†I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I‚Äôm still benefiting from.

Fast forward to today and they have obviously risen considerably and I have seen multiple stocks splits. 

I have been investing in SP500 and other stocks in the meantime too, and would say that my stake in NVDA now accounts for about 38% of my portfolio.

My question is whether I should reduce my position, take out the profits and put them back into an ETF?

2024-12-12,22:05:32,investing,NVDA Fundamental Analysis w/ Charts,"There is no shortage of dollars or bullshit when it comes to NVDA, the world's AI GPU hero of heroes. And with NVDA's revenue and profits not just increasing but multiplying in such a short timespan, investors want to know is it still a good time to buy, to catch the AI wave, as it builds and crashes upon the world, both that of capital investment and the greater world at large. 

Revenue and profits multiplying:
https://imgur.com/oOetNo4
https://imgur.com/caOkRlh

And here‚Äôs the chart that shows the impact of ChatGPT on the share price and earnings:

https://imgur.com/SxhIF9z

The top line is the price investors are paying. 

The bottom line is what those investors are getting, so to speak (NVDA‚Äôs net income over the previous year (trailing twelve months)) 

The vertical line roughly represents ChatGPT hitting 100m users with the line at 2023 January 1st and ChatGPT reportedely hitting 100m users sometime in that month of January according to Reuters and The Guardian.

Reuters:
https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/

The Guardian:
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/02/chatgpt-100-million-users-open-ai-fastest-growing-app

The firm will present you with the basic facts about NVDA, not as, and never as, a financial recommendation, but as an introduction to its financials, to give you a better idea if it's even worth your time to further explore NVDA as a company and potential vehicle of investment. The firm does not want you to be falsely misled into thinking we can offer you expertise on NVDA, we cannot. We can however answer the questions that we would expect any man who'd risk his capital to answer. How much money does NVDA make? How much do they have? And you would think, most importantly, how much has NVDA paid their previous investors so far? And while we don't believe the answers to these questions to justify investment, this firm adamantly believes that not knowing the answers to these questions is unacceptable for those who do or would choose to buy common stock in NVDA. 

In short, you'd have to be a fucking idiot to lend your money to a company without reading our charts and commentary, or the equivalent there of. To assess the full risk of NVDA however, will require a much deeper dive than a single blog post can provide.

Let‚Äôs take a look at what investors were thinking during the ChatGPT hype and whether that investment panned out at a fundamental rather than speculative level. In other words, did NVDA actually make more money or did its share price just go up?

https://imgur.com/wRnNWlD

This graph shows what percentage of NVDA‚Äôs share price was being represented by the money it had made (ttm net income/shares/share price). This 10 year low during 2023, shows unequivically that there was in fact investment hype during this time, that the price per earnings went very high as people were willing to accept less than 1% earnings just to get in on the hype. Why would investors accept such low earnings per dollar? Because these investors anticipated that the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and the AI hype around it, would mean a growth for NVDA that would more than make up for the price they paid. So were they dumb? Did they overpay? Let‚Äôs find out! 

For our example, we‚Äôll imagine an investor that bought sometime in February after the 100m user threshold was announced:

February 15th, 2023
  $22.75 price
  $0.175 net income
  $0.175/$22.75 = ~0.8% 


December 10th, 2024
  ~$2.57 net income
  $2.57/$22.17 = ~11% 


If an investor had bought sometime in February after the news of the 100m users was released. Let‚Äôs say for example February 15th at a closing price of approximately $22.75 per share they would have bought when NVDA‚Äôs trailing twelve month net income was about $0.175 (17.5 cents) per share, or about 0.8% of the price of the share at that time. Today, those same shares carry about $2.57 per share, a wopping 10x increase (almost 15 actually) in just 2 years. $2.57/$22.75 = ~11%, which means investors that bought in on the AI hype are already seeing the net income of their shares exceed the growth rate of the money supply (M2), which is about 7-8%. Meaning that NVDA isn‚Äôt just earning more dollars, its earning a greater share of the economic pie, and in a world where profits are actually returned to investors, would mean beating inflation (at least from a micro perspective). Now whether this cash that NVDA is reporting to generate will ever actually make it back to the shareholder is another story.

Now that we‚Äôve seen that buying (even when the fundamental value of the shares was at its lowest) has paid off, let‚Äôs take a look at how much money NVDA actually has:

https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj
https://imgur.com/6KPxWte

As you can see, NVDA has almost no money relative to its price. The market‚Äôs pricing of NVDA is derived principally from the money it is supposed to make in the future, rather than the present value of the company.

This is not what the firm would deem a good fundamental investment. Why? Because one would be paying a future price for future value, rather than the current price for its current value. Furthermore, the market is a game of desperation, and if shareholders are desperate for money, they should be offering their shares below the liquidation value of the company. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush after all. 

However, if one understands that NVDA‚Äôs price has been based on the growth of its earnings, and if one can also see that the growth of said earnings has gone up, but its stock price has gone down (as is the case for NVDA at the time of this post ~$135) then one could speculate that the market will not only price NVDA‚Äôs earnings higher than they are currently being priced, but that the market will actually price its earnings higher than in the previous quarters unless the market believes that NVDA‚Äôs future growth will be lower. The firm believes that within the next 3 months, NVDA will almost certainly attain new all time highs. In fact, we believe the passive participant in the market, will be genuinely surprised by how high the price of NVDA will go. At the time of this post, the firm has no positions in NVDA. An associate of the firm has exposure to NVDA through long options on the SNP500. A position the firm feels is not worth mentioning as longing the SNP500 might as well be a long on inflation.

So NVDA has made all this money? How much of that money has been returned to shareholders? 
https://imgur.com/RANJVwo

As you can see by that line at the bottom, almost none. About half of the money has been spent on share buybacks and when the company‚Äôs evaluation is 50x the money that it makes and 50x the money that it has, these buybacks only break even once the company has actually grown 50x (less so if you‚Äôre only evaluating the company on past earnings and not the amount of money it actually has, in this case, you might only want a 5x to consider yourself breaking even) . I‚Äôd much rather have my money now and use it to make more money, than wait around for NVDA to 50x. But NVDA doesnt give shareholders the option of how to spend their own money or how to evaluate the company. They don‚Äôt give the money to the shareholder to decide whether they want to wait for a 50x gain on NVDA. They‚Äôve decided they‚Äôll spend it for you. Not on growing the company or acquiring others, but by buying their own stock. 

Now that we can understand a basic view of NVDA‚Äôs finances and how it relates to its price, let‚Äôs take a glance at some of the more sinister aspects of NVDA.

First is this little tidbit the firm discovered while reading NVDA‚Äôs Q2 filing:
https://imgur.com/b438cbJ

NVDA expects you to follow **ALL**  6 of its listed social media accounts and will be leaving out material information in its 10Q and 10k filings that will only be available in its listed social media accounts. This is clearly unethical, and our firm at this time questions whether this intent to distribute exclusive material information across 6 different channels is even legal. Though we do not have the legal training or background to make a claim one way or the other, we would like to assume that the system in place would not allow such a thing.

Now lets throw a bone to the hardware guys. If you‚Äôve never heard of Moore‚Äôs Law, you can skip this section as trying to understand what Moore‚Äôs Law means will get in the way of seeing the blatant contradiction between NVDA‚Äôs CEO and his company‚Äôs own SEC filings. For your time:

   Moore's Law is the observation that the  number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years.

   The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel

   From Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law


So why is the firm bringing up Moore‚Äôs Law? We don‚Äôt even know what half that sentence means, and we certainly wouldnt be able to explain the nuances of NVDA‚Äôs hardware products. Well, there‚Äôs one thing we do know, it‚Äôs how to bullshit. So let‚Äôs wind back the clocks to the end of 2022. September. Right before entering Q4.

‚ÄúMoore‚Äôs Law‚Äôs dead,‚Äù Huang said, ‚ÄúAnd the ability for Moore‚Äôs Law to deliver twice the performance at the same cost, or at the same performance, half the cost, every year and a half, is over. It‚Äôs completely over, and so the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time, unfortunately, is a story of the past.‚Äù

Source: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moores-laws-dead-nvidia-ceo-jensen-says-in-justifying-gaming-card-price-hike-11663798618



Ok, so going into Q4, Moore‚Äôs Law is dead. The CEO said it‚Äôs over baby. Rapid growth is a thing of the past. That means the market should be lowering its growth expectations for NVDA right?

https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj
https://imgur.com/6KPxWte

But it did the opposite. Investors were willing to pay more for less, implying they actually expected NVDA‚Äôs long term growth rate to increase not decrease. Almost as if the market knew what NVDA would end up publishing in its Q4 filing:

Source: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001045810/000104581023000017/nvda-20230129.htm

(10k filed Feb 24, 2023)

So not only did the company contradict the CEO‚Äôs statements made in the September prior to the reported quarter, now theyre actually ahead of Moore‚Äôs law, and according to them, giving the entire industry a path forward. What the fuck. ü§£

And to finish things off, we‚Äôll put on our tin foil hats. The firm does not know how to verify the veracity of the following information. 

There has been a short report put out by Hindenburg Research regarding SMCI:

    https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/



The firm has no idea if the information reported is true. So this last section is just for fun. If the information in the report is true, then the firm would conclude that it paints the picture that SMCI has been funneling money out of the company into other companies, out of shareholder hands, into the hands of insiders and their network of family and friends. SMCI‚Äôs biggest customer? NVDA. In other words, if the allegations are accurate, the biggest chunk of money that SMCI funneled out came from NVDA. So it‚Äôs really not outside the realm of possibility that NVDA was intentionally buying from SMCI knowing where the money was ending up. The firm is not in the practice of lawsuits or building criminal cases. So the firm cannot and has no intention of doing so here for you now. The firm, however, is also not stupid. And the fact that all this money the company is making is not ending up in shareholders pockets, really isnt helping the ‚Äúmanagement would never steal from shareholders‚Äù fantasy that many would like to be the truism that must be disproved with mountains of evidence. It should have to be proven that the money is being returned to investors, not the other way around. When the vast majority of the profits dont go to the investors, which we can see from the dividend chart, but get spent on buybacks at 50x multiples, well people start to listen when accusations start to be made about money being funneled into other companies.

We‚Äôve learned a lot. We‚Äôve seen the impressive growth of NVDA‚Äôs earnings and how they relate to its price and the general hype around AI. We‚Äôve shown that the company has barely any money at all and is being priced on future earnings. We‚Äôve shown where some of this money is going. And we even got to put on our conspiracy hats for a little bit. 

And that is our fundamental analysis of NVDA, the AI giant. The good, the bad, and the fugly. Thanks for tuning in.

2024-12-12,18:51:03,investing,Returning to active stock portfolio management,"I recently decided to return to active stock portfolio management after my first attempt ended somewhat disastrously. To reconcile this experience and entertain others, I want to reflect on the mistakes I made and the new approaches I‚Äôve adopted.

But first, briefly, the story of my initial failure.

When I started managing my portfolio, I quickly learned about the S&P 500 but was convinced I was smart enough to outperform the market. Arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall.

In 2019, I flirted with Bitcoin, which initially delivered great returns. Encouraged by the hype, I also invested heavily in PaySafe shortly after its IPO, believing in its potential because ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù said it was going to be great. At the same time, I was doing a lot of day trading. Looking back, I realize I wasn‚Äôt trading rationally. I‚Äôd look at graphs and invest simply because I felt the price would go up. I was taking desirable outcomes for granted.

Although I made a few conservative and reasonable investments, their success couldn‚Äôt offset the losses caused by Bitcoin‚Äôs decline, PaySafe‚Äôs terrible performance, and my risky trading. After 18 months, my portfolio was down 40%.

The arrogance I started with made the loss feel devastating. I abandoned my investment account for several years.

When I returned to it a year ago, I discovered that the growth of my conservative investments, along with Bitcoin‚Äôs recovery, had boosted my portfolio to 20% growth from my initial investment. I sold everything and bought into the S&P 500, feeling that I wasn‚Äôt capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund. This turned out to be a good action, as the S&P 500 performed very well this year.

Now, I feel I‚Äôve learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again. 

To avoid repeating the same mistakes, I‚Äôve set specific rules to guide me:

1. I Avoid Speculative Investments
I now steer clear of speculative assets like crypto, IPO stocks, or companies like Tesla. I want to be a disciplined investor, keeping my greed under control.  

2. I Reject Market Timing
I no longer believe in timing the market but instead focus on time in the market. I avoid trying to ‚Äúbuy low today and sell high tomorrow‚Äù because it‚Äôs too easy to confuse wishful thinking with reality. Paying attention to micro events can help to take advantage of daily fluctuations, but it requires too much time and still, offers uncertain outcomes. More often than not, it doesn‚Äôt pay off.

3. Focus on Debt-to-Equity
In the past, I ignored the debt-to-equity ratio. Now, I prioritize companies with consistent net income and manageable debt levels.

4. Limit Individual Stock Exposure
I cap my individual stock picks at 5% of my total portfolio. Previously, this rule would have forced me to find 20 or more stocks to invest in, leading to choosing assets that were just ‚Äúokay‚Äù rather than ones I genuinely liked. Thankfully, with most of my portfolio now in the S&P 500, individual stock picks act as a good supplement rather than a replacement for the index.

5. Invest in Goods and Services I Value
My approach to stock selection has shifted. I now look for companies whose products and services I personally interact with and consider them of great value. If the companies also demonstrate strong financial performance and maintain a reasonable debt-to-equity ratio, they become my choice.

I hope these rules will help me sleep well at night, keep me from obsessing over financial news, and generate decent returns that complement the S&P 500.",TSLA,Tesla

2024-12-11,13:43:05,investing,Is a trillion dollar valuation possible for Spotify?,"In all the investing subs I am surprised that more people are not mentioning Spotifys 2030 ambition. In 2022 they presented their target for 100 billion in revenue by 2030. They claim they are ahead on their plans so far.

At 4 billion euros in revenue last quarter they obviously have a ways to go. But surprisingly, ads made up just 472‚Ç¨ million of their revenue, while subscribers made up just over 3.5‚Ç¨ billion. What‚Äôs more, they have 2.5x as many ad supported users as premium subscribers, meaning they have a ton of room for improving ad revenue. I imagine they are planning on ad revenue growing rapidly in the next 6 years. It seems they could easily double revenue without adding any new users just by growing ad revenue.


I know it‚Äôs very speculative, but what is their potential market cap in 2030 if they hit their target? Is it possible that they get above 1 trillion one day? Or is this overly ambitions given the market they are in?

FWIW they have YouTube in their cross hairs. I have been seeing more and more songs that have the ‚Äûvideo‚Äú option, and only within the last week I saw that ‚Äûsuper simple songs‚Äú recently added a video to their latest song (they are of baby shark fame and one of the biggest creators on YouTube). With podcasts having video and being able to easily monetize that with targeted ads from Spotify, it seems that the line between Spotify and YouTube is becoming blurred. 

It seems to me like Spotify is a good long term play and can be anywhere from 5x to 10x 6 years from now.

The biggest risk is competition. But Apple Music is really just for Apple users, and even then Apple users seem to prefer Spotify. Globally it seems like there is a lot of room for consolidation. For example, Siri is really just USA, and other countries also have their own audio apps. But globally Spotify seems to be the clear winner, and I would imagine that consolidation happens.

What are your thoughts? Is Spotify a good long term investment?

Edit: also AI is a huge risk. I‚Äôve been using Suno and it is pretty great. But Spotify is also known as a leading tech company. Google ‚Äûagile the Spotify way‚Äú. Many European companies are trying to emulate their approach to the agile process. Meaning that I also have some faith in their ability to innovate and execute on the software end

Edit 2: luckily, with stocks, we can put our money where our mouth is. I think they‚Äôll 5x-10x in 6 years. Also: the projected global ad revenue is projected to reach 1 trillion in 2030. Due to ai, I see Google search ad revenue decreasing. In addition to premium subscribers, there is an absolutely massive opportunity in ad revenue which they have yet to tap into",AAPL,Apple

**First, the foundation**

Like any smart investor you need a solid base. Something that will grow steadily and won't make you want to sell out when there is an inevitable market crash. This is why for my first pie, I have gone with 80% VUAG and 20% IGLA.

**Tech Focus**

People may say that my portfolio is too heavily weighted towards the USA and tech, I think the tech giants like Apple etc are not going anywhere. So my allocations are as follows,

Amazon- Moving into the AI space with Nova, Revenue growing steadily YOY.

Microsoft- Almost in the 'too big to fail' category. Not going anywhere and an easy choice IMO.

Alphabet- Recovered well and quickly after 2022 crash. Massive AI player. Easy choice

Apple- Still most popular in the Phone space. Can only see this stock going one way.

Meta- Absolutely flying in recent years. Hopeful Zuck will keep it up.

ASML- Riskier pick but believe they will have a good year next year. Looking 4-5 years into the future with this one.

Nvidia- Don't think I need to say too much with this choice. Looking long term, very excited about this one.

IonQ- Main player in quantum computing space, looking at some volatile years upcoming but I have faith that they could be huge in 5+ years.

**Consumer Focus**

Costco wholesale- Almost unshakeable business model, no strong competition IMO.

Pets at home- Smaller allocation for this one. Seems undervalued to me as people are always going to treat their pets. Will keep tabs on this one as still unsure.

Procter and Gamble- Been around for a million years. Very stable with dividend growth YOY.

Walmart- Consumer powerhouse in USA, strong financials and IMO not going anywhere,#

**Finance Focus**

Berkshire Hathaway- Trust in Buffett, no pressure from short term market trends.

Intuit- Dividend growth YOY, in an incredible place financially.

JP Morgan and Chase- In the 'too big to fail' category in my opinion. Involved in so many industries so not dependent on one for revenue.

MasterCard- Very able to adapt to the market, only risk is inflation IMO.

PayPal- After share price crash in 2022. Revenues didn't faulter and net income bounced back within the year. Undervalued IMO.

S&P Global- Adapting well to new tech such as AI. Been around forever.

**Real Estate Focus**

Realty income- Unshaken by the market crashes in past 20 years. Dividend Growth YOY.

VICI properties- Predictable revenue due to triple net leases. In a strong financial postion.

I think I have a good mix of sectors and stability/growth. I am not looking for advice but will take onboard any criticism.

2024-12-08,13:47:50,investing,"I'm bullish on Rivian, and here is why.","Currently holding 65 shares, looking to round that out to 100 next pay period.  I am not a financial advisor, and this is not investment advice. I am simply sharing my thoughts. 

These are the things I will be watching this year, to continue to add to my position, or to see if I should reconsider my bullish sentiment. 

1. Nearing profitability.  Rivian has recently re-affirmed that by Q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. They are expected to deliver just over 50,000 vehicles for the year. That is a combination of mostly R1S and R1T with some of the Amazon delivery vans. If there guidance is correct, and they either meet or beat q4 '24 earnings, it is a bullish sign.

  
2. $6 Billion loan from Uncle Sam. Now the new administration does create a bit of tension here.  The new ""DOGE"" agency is going to be cutting Gov. spending across the board. There is some concern they will take away this loan that the Biden administration had given to Rivian. While this is certainly a possibility, I do not think it is going to happen. I think it would be a very bad look politically, and would give strength to the argument musk will us his Gov. connections to attack his competitors. Because of that, I think this money is safely staying with Rivian.  If it turns out DOGE is going to back down from this threat, that is another bullish sign.

  
3. VW Rivian joint venture. VW NA is about to change, they are getting a new CEO, Kjell Gruner, who previously was the President and CEO of Porsche Cars of North America and then moved to Rivian to be there ""Chief Commercial Officer & President, Business Growth"".  VW desperatley needs software expertise, and Rivian delivers that in spades. That combined with VWs massive buying and production power, is a strong match. This is a bullish sign right now, and what I think has been pushing to stock upwards. 

VW has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits.  The introduction of the old/new Scout brand, that looks mighty similar to Rivians R2 concepts. As well as confirming the deal with Rivian, it looks like they're finally going to start to take serious steps to rebuilding their reputation, especially in NA. 

  
4. Rivians customers are happy, and according to a recent Consumer Reports Survey, 86% of owners say they would buy a Rivian again, better than Tesla. If they are happy with their purchase, they will talk to their other wealthy friends about their Rivian, word of mouth is very powerful.

  
5. The inevitable Tesla Comparison. RIVIAN IS NOT TESLA. Now obviously Tesla the company in 2024 is very different to Tesla the company in 2015. Back in 2015 it was the 3rd year of Model S production and the first of Model X. 

in 2015 Tesla sold just over 50,000 Model S. Now in 2023, just two years after the Rivian R1T debuted, Rivian sold just over 47,000 vehicles. I think Tesla in 2015 is more of a fair comparison to Rivian now in 2024, but Tesla now in 2024 is not so comparable to Rivian now in 2024.

  
I think Rivian makes a fantastic product, and there's a bright future ahead for them.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-12-07,01:10:51,investing,"COVID as a Mini ""Lost Decade""","By overlaying earnings and market cap we can get a pretty rough story of what happened with COVID and money printing and interest rate hikes and what this means for the future.

This image below is a bunch of large companies that represent the SPY. The colored areas are their earnings (with their predicted earnings in a lighter shade) and the black line is their combined market cap (price).

[https://imgur.com/a/GoOoF02](https://imgur.com/a/GoOoF02)  
I've annotated a few arrows to explain what seems to have roughly happened.

**Orange Arrow 2020 - 2022:** Interest rates drop which causes excess liquidity to flood the market. Those who already had assets saw huge portfolio increases. This new wealth combined with low interest caused a housing price boom. New money in the hands of retail caused cults to form around memes like GME. Plus no one wants to work and is wfh.

**Red Arrow 2022:** A ""lost decade"" is a period of time where new investors have no access to good investments. People who just started working in 2022 or decided to start investing in 2022 had no good place to put their money and would only have broken even in 2024. (the horizontal dash). In a larger crisis like with Japan's lost decade(s) you have 10-20 years where the stock market effectively grinds sideways. 

**Red & Orange**

[https://imgur.com/a/FD8zYAb](https://imgur.com/a/FD8zYAb)

If you overlay the SPY with the Fed's interest rate policy you can see that it looks to have caused some temporary price distress but long term the price is correlated with earnings, not interest rate.  A ""lost decade"" is effectively exuberance that ""pulls forward"" price appreciation and ""steals"" it from future investors. 

In the COVID response, those who had assets in 2020 benefited while those who started investing in 2022 had a difficult time b/c they didn't have access to the exponential growth of markets.

**Blue Line**

Long term investors who think in decades and don't actually need large purchases like cars or weddings (like old people...) can just ignore these bumps and focus on long term earnings.

\---

The above is obviously over-simplified but it's an example of how using earnings and price in tandem allows you to see the underlying story behind price movement.

If you just focus on price, all you can do is draw a line up and the right and say things that are true like ""AAPL is a good company""

[https://imgur.com/a/5L07X9p](https://imgur.com/a/5L07X9p)

You have no perspective.

The worst example is someone who got scared of investing in stocks in 2020 but seeing everyone around him get rich for 2 years he decides to start investing in 2022 and loses money for two years and decides to stop and then starts watching everyone around him make more money... in a never-ending spiral of 2 year delayed FOMO.

It's like relying on a tourist pamphlet in a foreign city. If you can't make a judgement of quality independently then you will always pay high prices and wait in long lines.",AAPL,Apple

2024-12-06,17:54:17,investing,What would you consider a good entry point for bitcoin?,"Bitcoin recently hit a value of $100k, as I‚Äôm sure we are all aware by now.

Arguably, bitcoin has been one of the most successful investments over the last 10 years, up there with NVDA and other Mag 7 stocks.

I won‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôve been a Bitcoin hater for most of my investing career. It‚Äôs tough to conceptualize fully, it has not always been mainstream enough so it‚Äôs understandable to be learn of it, and its supports are so ardent and ravenous that it feels like a cult. I don‚Äôt blame any skeptics for not putting their money into it.

That said, over the last year or two, it has certainly gained a ton of legitimacy as it has played a significant role in Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign and also begun to be an asset that hedge funds are also purchasing.

I, like many others I assume, want to make it a part of my portfolio, but it‚Äôs tough to analyze its value because it doesn‚Äôt act like your usually security exchanged on the stock market. There are no balance sheets or income statements for bitcoin to look at, and I have no idea if its valuation is way too high or too low.

I can certainly see it continuing to go up in the near to mid term future. If you told me it would hit $200k in the next two years, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. That said, I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it also hit $40k in the next two years too.

Is now a good time to buy? There‚Äôs a lot of hype around it after it just hit $100k in value, so I‚Äôm nervous about jumping into it right now, but I‚Äôm struggling to put together a fair value estimate that I should wait for it to hit before I buy.

What are your thoughts on this matter?

My portfolio mainly consists of Tech stocks as for it is a market I am actively participating in and informed about, but I'm open to broadening markets. 

I was either planning on dumping more money into VTI, however as it reached $300 It became a bit too expensive for me to want to invest more in. Something I'm more concerned about is a crash, especially in the tech market as for it is reaching all time highs, but from what the tech market has shown in the past decade, is UP with some downs obviously.

2024-12-04,17:59:31,investing,Is my investment plan good in order to fight inflation while keeping my money relatively safe?,"Hey all,
I'm looking to invest part of my salary monthly. I started with a ~$2000:

* Most of it is in EXI2 iShares fond
* Then equal smaller amounts in MSFT and NVDA

The plan is to scatter around 500 USD each month, with 300 in the fond and 100 in MSFT and NVDA (these are subject to change, some times I may go with Amazon, Ali Baba etc.).

The idea is to not keep all my savings in the bank and to have a very low risk, comfortably with small but safe returns.

Please validate if this sounds good, not trying to become the next Warren Buffet, just trying to fight inflation :D

2024-12-03,20:49:45,investing,Investment Advice- Rebalancing?,"I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.

I'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.

My main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)

  
**Current Accounts and Savings:**

  
Personal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.

Business Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. 

SEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?

ROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.

M1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.

Regular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.

Chase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.

  
Crypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.

  
So my currently contributions to all my accounts are :

  
SEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  
ROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  
M1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  
Chase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  
Crypto- $400 DCA into BTC  


I don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.

I'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper.

2024-12-01,11:04:38,investing,A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry,"Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).

Tesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ""ate it's own cake too"" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).

2024-12-01,09:54:01,investing,Thoughts on Tesla in December,"So right after Tesla recently reached it's ath I made the decision to short it and I made some decent returns on that but already closed the position as Ibfelt like it was done with it's current correction.

But I still think the company is very overvalued. I would think 250 is a fair value or maybe even less. 

Let's be honest the overvaluation is due to people having strong feeling for Elon Musk not bcs the company has an economic moat.

So the question we need to ask ourselves is: will the postive sentiment end at any point in the near future and honestly I do not think so. Bunch of recent tweets were pretty controversial and all that but I feel like this won't have any further impact atm. I just read they are recently started production on the newest Y model and it's supposed to be available in early 2025 so this might actually push the price up until then.

2024-11-30,03:26:22,investing,$UMAC: figuring FMV and the future of warfare,"Last Saturday, Fox prints this piece.  [https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-scrambles-drones-shape-landscape-war-future-here](https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-scrambles-drones-shape-landscape-war-future-here)

Then on Sunday, Elon tweets this [https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1860574377013838033](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1860574377013838033)

Then on Wednesday, it is announced that Don Jr joins the board of UMAC here [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/27/unusual-machines-shares-soar-donald-trump-jr-joins-advisory-board.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/27/unusual-machines-shares-soar-donald-trump-jr-joins-advisory-board.html)

So what the hell is UMAC (Unusual Machines).  It is an absolutely tiny non-factor of a consumer drone maker located in a warehouse in Orlando.  Prior to the election, it had a flatlining stock trading around $1.50 and a market cap around $12M.  Then post election, the stock began rising suddenly with a number of large insider purchases.  Then with the announcement of Don Jr, the stock has soared to near $20 and a market cap of around $150M.  What's the hidden agenda.

Well, Don Jr. is a smart (i.e. opportunistic) man.  The war in Ukraine has shown the world that land wars are obsolete.  Your $10M Abrams tank can be neutralized by a single drone and a grenade that costs less than $500.  Infantrymen are obsolete.  They can be hunted mercilessly 24 hours a day by drones, day and night, rain or shine, in the trenches, in holes and tunnels, around corners, remotely using thermal vision.

Drones can only be defended by physical means (basically AI controlled counter-drones and bulelts).  Electronic jamming can be effectively countered with electronic shielding.  See this excellent video by Mark Rober.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrGENEXocJU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrGENEXocJU)

Drones are the future of warfare.  We will not need people.  We will not need bombers.  We just need someone with a suitcase of drones able to infiltrate within a few miles of a desired target, release a couple drones with explosives, and the target is wiped out.  No need to send in a $2B B-2 bomber equipped with a $250M worth of bombs to take out the target.  $20,000 of drones in a suitcase will suffice.  Imagine also if that suitcase can lay their dormant and be opened remotely as needed to strike any target in the area.

Drone warfare and terrorist strikes are coming to a place near you.  Sadly.

Lastly, the US DoD spends nearly $2T a year ($1.99T to be more exact).  This is clearly a level which is unsustainable, especially with the rising cost of debt service (yes, the Fed will need to engage in QE3 or 4 or 5 to prevent federal insolvency).  Spending cuts will need to happen.  And DoD with its bloated, irrational spending will be the primary targets.  It has to be.

You see, the Trump administration is dismantling the entire NeoCon apparatus.  Elon and Vivek, along with JD and Hegseth (maybe) and Tulsi and RFK2 (the Trump Avengers) are all zealots of the anti-establishment, anti-neocon, anti-war agenda.  I will bet you a nickle that they will chop trillions (as Vivek targeted $2T) in federal spending, starting with Elon's target the F-35.  Military strategy will evolve from enormously expensive concentrated single pieces of power (F-35, aircraft carriers, B-2, Abrams) to inexpensive fleets of cheap drones a la the Nova Corp.  [https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Nova\_Corps?file=NovaCorpsInBattle.png](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Nova_Corps?file=NovaCorpsInBattle.png)

These drones are nearly indefensible.  And they will be controlled by AI (buy NVDA).  This is the future of war.  And probably the doom of civilization.  It will not be AI that kills us off.  We won't make it that far.  Rather, we will kill ourselves off using AI-controlled drones to fight our wars.  The country with the smartest, fastest, and most drones wins.  We can strike every nuke silo simultaneously and defend our cities and facilities with a dome of drones.  The US not only has to defend its soil, but also that of its allies across the world.  It is hard to imagine how many drones the US military will need.  But lets try.

It is estimated that Ukraine is using 10,000 drones a month.  That is 300 a day.  This just on a small battlefield (only a 600 mile front-line!), capacity constrained military, using Generation 1 human-operated drone tactics.  Imagine having to defends tens of thousand critical facilities across the world at all times from a terrorist attack.  Imagine having to be prepared to fight a Drone World War all run by AI.  These systems would be able to control thousands of drones at a time.  We are talking many millions of drones for basic readiness (all operated by NVDA-driven AI).

So lets say the US military will prepare to fight a war globally on a front that is 100X the 600-mile front in Ukraine.  This may be low given the literally thousands of targets it will need to defend.  The battlefield is not contiguous.  And lets say AI war will use 50X (definitely low) the drones of human-operated war.  This is a 50M standing-army of drones required for defense (10,000 x 100 x 50).  That is for just 1 month of war.  Let's say the US military needs an 18-month stockpile.  That is 900M drones, lets call it 1B to simplify the math.  At say $200 per drone, that will cost $200B (about the cost of 2.5 F-35s to put that in perspective).

Lets say there is an attrition rate of 20% per year due to training and replacement (5-year life expectancy).  That is 250M replacement drones needed per year.  That is $50B for replacement drones.

This is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than developing and maintaining high-tech weapon systems and soldiers.  The savings you can achieve by reducing the number of infantry and high tech jets and ships and tanks, replacing them with drones are massive.  Enough to bail out the US federal debt!  Sure this change won't happen overnight, but it is happenings as we speak thanks to Ukraine.

So what does this all have to do with UMAC?  Well, it is perfectly positioned to ride the wave of this coming military revolution.  It has the anti-neocon son of the future president on its advisory board and from what I can tell, he is also a very significant shareholder in the company.  There is no way this deal was just put together in the past few weeks.  It had to be in the works for months subject to Trump winning the election.  Which then triggered new stock issuance by UMAC, DonJr's investment, and his ascension to the board.

The CEO of UMAC is a guy named Allan Evans.  You can hear him here back in July 2024 talking about focusing on military contracts and the need for NDAA-complaint manufacturers.  They are focusing on being an NDAA-compliant parts supplier to the drone market.  These guys know they can't make the sophisticated AI drones that the military will need.  But they sure as hell can supply the drone parts.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAQjqQyyCzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAQjqQyyCzQ)

At a $150M market cap, this thing is ridiculously underpriced relative to where it should be after proper hyping.  I think the market is still trying to figure it out.  You can't value it on current fundamentals.  It is just the shell company for DonJr (and thereby Trump) to profit off the coming drone military revolution.  Just like Truth Social was/is for DonSr.  The future of drone warfare has arrived.  UMAC is positioned as the domestic NDAA-compliant part supplier.  With DonJr, it is the supplier of choice.  I don't know if there is another NDAA-compliant drone parts supplier out there (probably not given that it's mostly all been made thus far in China), UMAC has the pole position with DonJr as the driver.  It just takes a few introductions and investment dollars in manufacturing capabilities (Elon can help with that) for UMAC to be awarded (directly or indirectly) purchase orders.  If you are a defense contractor hoping to win a bid, would you not include as part of your proposal some business directed to UMAC?

If even 5% of military drone spending makes it through to UMAC, that is $10B in revenue to build the standing army, and $2.5B a year ongoing.  Assuming a 10% net margin, that is $1B in profits on the stockpiling and $250M a year for replacements.  And if there is a US-supplied war somewhere, then it would be even higher.  Ignoring stockpiling revenues and valuing it only on the replacement revenue, at a reasonable 20X PE ratio, this is a $5B market cap company.  That is 33X from current levels.  If they are targeted to achieve that in 10 years, then that implies a current FMV of $1.2B which is 8X from the current $150M market cap or about a $160 stock price.

Think $1.2B is an absurd hype valuation?  Let me introduce you to the psychedelic and weed stocks of a few years ago.  And also the countless biotech stocks that may someday enter into a Phase 1 trial.  And with those stocks, you could not build a case for their valuations.  It was just hype and blind-buying.  UMAC actually has a story and a path towards much bigger things.  And someone named Trump.",NVDA,NVIDIA
2024-11-29,19:56:20,investing,Thesis: A Food  for Though on Fundamentals of TSLA in Relationship to the Era When Warren Buffet Was Born,"Hi investing friends, granted calculations say TSLA is overbought by around 7 to 8x  but if we go back in time and imagine it's today, could TSLA be at an era when it was good for Warren to buy Wrigley's stocks or Coca Cola stocks?

I get Buffett's picks which are first en masse, second they are consumables, 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster(nothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and there's nothing hard about chewing and drinking Coke), 4th don't require R and D at some point, I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.

Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).

Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

2024-11-29,00:12:45,investing,the TRUTH about investing no one tells you,"# 1. The system is rigged

The financial industry thrives on overcomplicating things to justify fees.

As Charlie Munger said:*""The whole damn system is corrupt... everyone wants easy money, fast. And that requires a big fee.""*

Think about it: there‚Äôs **$2 trillion** locked in mutual funds charging **2% fees** while underperforming cheap index funds like the S&P 500. Who‚Äôs really winning here? Hint: it‚Äôs not us.



# 2. Temperament beats intelligence

Investing isn‚Äôt about being the smartest‚Äîit‚Äôs about controlling your emotions.

* Warren Buffett: *""The most important quality is temperament, not intellect.""*
* I read a study of a fund that averaged an **18% annual return**, but the **average investor in that fund lost money** because they tried to time the market.

**Lesson:** Fear and greed will destroy your portfolio faster than any bad stock pick.

Here‚Äôs your free investing hack: **buy the S&P 500 and chill.**

* Low fees.
* Decades of growth.
* Outperforms **98% of funds** consistently.

Even Charlie Munger admits:*""Wealth managers have almost zero chance of beating an unmanaged index like the S&P.""*

So why do people chase stock-picking glory? Because too many investors confuse excitement with success.



# 4. Picking stocks is really hard

Think it‚Äôs easy to find the next Tesla? It‚Äôs not. And even if you do, good luck getting in before the hype.

* Buffett: *""If you can‚Äôt value the stock, you can‚Äôt invest in it. You can gamble on it, but you can‚Äôt invest.""*
* Most people buying stocks have never even read a balance sheet.

**Picking winners is possible, but it‚Äôs incredibly hard‚Äîthink Charlie Munger-level hard.**

  
**What this all means**

The truth is, the game is rigged for most people to lose. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt win.The winners aren‚Äôt the ones chasing hype stocks or flexing their ""10-baggers""‚Äîthey‚Äôre the ones quietly compounding wealth by staying disciplined and focusing on what works: **consistency, patience, and a solid strategy.**

2024-11-28,18:30:09,investing,Paying off the Mortgage instead of investing for growth ?,"Can someone please explain the focus on paying off the mortgage either as quickly as possible or before retirement?

I‚Äôve bought 4 houses and a vacation condo selling all but the 4th house which I live in and bought 2.5 years ago 

In each case I took out a 30 year mortgage at the best rate available at the time 

My monthly payment ranged from a little over $1,000 to the current $3300

When I sold house #3 after 20 years, I still cleared enough to pay cash for the current house. But, I put down just enough to get a 2.75% mortgage and put the rest into my brokerage account (mostly NVDA & PANL). Now, combined with what was already in the brokerage account and the IRAs, we have a bit over $6M which easily generates over $10k/month - when including social security and small pension is around $20,000/month

I fail to see how we could have acquired this much $ had we accelerated or house payoff

I would like to hear reasoning for paying off the house as my son is asking me for financial advice and I think my system has worked well. Is it a factor of time and luck?

The other thing we are doing that appears to contradict my reading is we are drawing on the IRA money first instead of the brokerage account money. I‚Äôm doing this for 2 reasons 1. Keep RMDs (in two more years) from being greater than we need- putting us potentially in higher tax bracket (and Medicare costs) and 2.

2024-11-24,19:36:08,investing,How are you thinking about your portfolio given the outcome of the 2024 US Election?,"As the new Trump administration takes office in 2025, we will all grapple with a rapidly evolving economic landscape. The anticipated policies promise significant shifts reminiscent of Hungary's economic transformation.   Please let me know if you agree or disagree with any of the picks below...

# Understanding the Policy Shifts

**1. Economic Nationalism and Protectionism**

The administration's ""America First"" agenda is expected to:

* **Increase Tariffs on Imports**: Tariffs could rise by 10-25%, mainly targeting Chinese goods. This move aims to protect domestic industries but may lead to higher consumer prices.
* **Promote Onshoring**: Incentives for companies to relocate manufacturing to the U.S. could include tax breaks and subsidies.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Beneficiaries**: Domestic manufacturers like **Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT)** and **3M Company (NYSE: MMM)** could see increased demand due to reduced competition from imports.
* **Potential Losers**: Companies reliant on imported materials or global supply chains like **Apple** may face higher production costs and supply-chain disruptions.

**2. Deregulation and Tax Cuts**

Anticipated measures include:

* **Corporate Tax Reductions**: Lowering the rate from 21% to 15% could significantly boost net earnings.
* **Deregulation Efforts**: Especially in energy and finance, rolling back regulations like Dodd-Frank could reshape industry operations.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Financial Sector Gains**: Banks like **JPMorgan Chase** and **Goldman Sachs** might experience increased profitability due to relaxed lending regulations and lower taxes.
* **Energy Sector Surge**: Traditional oil and gas companies like **Exxon Mobil Corporation** and **Chevron Corporation** could benefit from reduced environmental regulations and expanded drilling rights.

**3. Increased Government Intervention**

Potential actions:

* **Sector-Specific Policies**: Favoring industries aligned with national priorities, possibly leading to subsidies for sectors like defense and infrastructure.
* **Unpredictable Regulatory Changes**: Sudden policy shifts could affect long-term planning and investment.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Defense Contractors Advantage**: Companies like **Lockheed Martin** and **Northrop Grumman** may secure lucrative government contracts amid increased defense spending.
* **Risk of Cronyism**: Firms with close ties to the administration could outperform, while others may struggle to compete.

# What Lessons Can We Learn from Hungary Under Viktor Orb√°n

* **Nationalization and Heavy Taxation**: Foreign companies faced significant taxes, reducing foreign investment.
* **Favoritism Towards Domestic Firms**: Companies aligned with government objectives received advantages, distorting competition.
* **Market Volatility**: Unpredictable policies led to investor uncertainty and capital flight.

**Application to the U.S. Context:**

* **Regulatory Risk**: Investors should be wary of sudden policy changes that could impact sectors like technology and healthcare.
* **Importance of Government Relations**: Companies investing in government lobbying and aligning with national priorities may fare better.

# Sector-Specific Investment Opportunities and Risks

**1. Sectors Poised for Growth**

* **Energy Sector**
   * *Analysis*: With deregulation and a focus on energy independence, traditional energy companies will likely expand operations.
   * *Investment Picks*: Consider **Halliburton** for oilfield services and **Phillips 66** for refining and midstream operations.
   * *Commodities Impact*: Expect a potential rise in crude oil prices due to increased domestic demand, making investments in oil futures or ETFs like the **United States Oil Fund LP (NYSEARCA: USO)** attractive.
* **Financial Services**
   * *Analysis*: Deregulation could lead to increased lending and investment banking activities.
   * *Investment Picks*: Regional banks like **(NYSE: PNC)** may benefit from economic growth and deregulation.
* **Defense and Infrastructure**
   * *Analysis*: Increased government spending in defense and infrastructure projects.
   * *Investment Picks*: Infrastructure companies like **(NYSE: VMC)** and **Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM)** could see increased demand for construction materials.

**2. Sectors Facing Headwinds**

* **Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals**
   * *Analysis*: Potential reforms aiming to reduce drug prices could squeeze profit margins.
   * *Investment Risks*: Companies like **Pfizer** and **Merck** may face pricing pressures.
   * *Considerations*: Biotech firms focusing on innovative treatments may be less impacted.
* **Renewable Energy**
   * *Analysis*: A shift away from climate initiatives could reduce subsidies and support for renewable energy projects.
   * *Investment Risks*: Companies like **First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR)** and **NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE)** might experience slowed growth.
   * *Commodities Impact*: Potential decrease in demand for renewable energy commodities like lithium and rare earth elements.
* **Technology and Multinationals**
   * *Analysis*: Tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt global supply chains.
   * *Investment Risks*: Tech giants like **Microsoft** and **Alphabet** might face international market challenges.

# Navigating Market Volatility

**Strategies to Mitigate Risks:**

* **Defensive Stocks**: Consider utilities and consumer staples companies like **The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG)** and **Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE: DUK)**, which tend to be more stable during market fluctuations.
* **Gold and Precious Metals**: Historically seen as a haven, investing in gold through **SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA: GLD)** or mining companies like **Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD)** can hedge against volatility.

# Exploring International Investment Opportunities

**Emerging Markets Resilience:**

* **India**
   * *Analysis*: With a domestic solid growth trajectory, India is less exposed to U.S. policy changes.
   * *Investment Picks*: **HDFC Bank Limited (NYSE: HDB)** offers exposure to India's growing middle class.
* **Taiwan and South Korea**
   * *Analysis*: Key semiconductor and AI supply chain players are potentially insulated from U.S.-China trade tensions.
   * *Investment Picks*: **Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd**.

**Other Potential Diversification Plays:**

* **International ETFs**: Investing in funds like **iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: EEM)** provides broad exposure to emerging markets.
* **Commodities**: Diversifying with commodities like copper and nickel, essential for global infrastructure and technology, can capitalize on international demand.",AAPL,Apple
2024-11-23,16:50:13,investing,Isn't rebalancing selling your winners and keeping your losers?,"I've been thinking about the philosophy of rebalancing. The purpose of rebalancing your portfolio (just buy all stocks bro, excluded) is to maintain a risk profile that's consistent with your goals. 

So say if NVDA went up by 300% and INTC got halved and now NVDA is 80% of your portfolio. The philosophy of rebalancing would demand you to sell a large portion of NVDA and invest in INTC. 

That strategy if we look at the chart, doesn't work so well for your wallet. 

So here's me wondering if rebalancing on the surface is ""buy low sell high"" when in reality it's just ""sell your winners and buy more losers"". 

On the converse with an outsized NVDA position you just increased your risk on one company big time so if NVDA gets hit by say an antitrust or Jensen's brain scan AI go Skynet, you're gonna get decimated. 

There's a lot of moving gears in this decision. ",NVDA,NVIDIA

2024-11-22,02:28:05,investing,Investing in What You Know: Modern Tools for Finding Hidden Gems,"In 'One Up On Wall Street' (great book, highly recommend) Peter Lynch emphasizes the idea of ""investing in what you know"". Specifically, he talks about how some of his best investing ideas initially came from a friend or family member raving about a particular product:

>*""Taco Bell, I was impressed with the burrito on a trip to California; La Quinta Motor Inns, somebody at the rival Holiday Inn told me about it; Volvo, my family and friends drive this car; Apple Computer, my kids had one at home and then the systems manager bought several for the office; Service Corporation International, a Fidelity electronics analyst (who had nothing to do with funeral homes, so this wasn‚Äôt his field) found on a trip to Texas; Dunkin‚Äô Donuts, I loved the coffee; and recently the revamped Pier 1 Imports, recommended by my wife. In fact, Carolyn is one of my best sources. She‚Äôs the one who discovered L‚Äôeggs.‚Äù*

According to Lynch, this is the key advantage retail investors have over Wall Street: spotting great products and brands in their daily lives, often long before they arrive on an Investment analyst's desk.

I'm wondering whether this process can be modernised, and expanded.

One challenge I face, for instance, is that I don‚Äôt live in the U.S., so the American products I notice are often already global, and likely already on Wall Street‚Äôs radar. This limits my ability to discover the kind of early opportunities Lynch described if I want to invest in American companies. 

Same goes for brands in Asia or Africa‚Äîsurely there are great companies out there, future ten-baggers, but many of us won't come across simply because we're not exposed to their products, and by the time we are we've missed the boat.

I‚Äôm curious if people know of tools or methods to help identify these hidden gems. 

Perhaps something like an online product rating site or resource for finding universally loved brands that haven‚Äôt gone mainstream yet. I‚Äôve thought about using tools like Amazon's ‚Äútop rated‚Äù section, but reviews can be manipulated, and often it's just Chinese tat you can't invest in. I also checked out¬†r/buyitforlife, but it‚Äôs not quite what I'm after.

Thoughts?

And please no ""put it all in VOO and come back in 80 years"". Yes most of my money is already in Index funds. This is an investing sub, and people should be interested in investment discussion, not just parroting the same old Bogleheads shit ad nauseam.",AAPL,Apple
2024-11-21,04:54:26,investing,My mother asked me if I can help her with investing,"Im 20 years old and have been learning about investing for a solid 2-3 years now. My mother (37) sees and appreciates the work i‚Äôve been putting in and asked me today for advice. 

‚ÄúShould I invest with the bank or would you want to help me?‚Äù

I told her i‚Äôd help her. She doesn‚Äôt like much risk in any areas of her life so i‚Äôm thinking on focusing her portfolio on ETFs (VOO, SCHD) or simply just the S&P 500. 

Also thought about dividend paying companies (KO, O) or large caps like AAPL, MFST etc. 

Considering the bull market, a lot of non investors have been getting excited about the market recently. We‚Äôre at/near market ATH so I feel like I should tell her to hold off for a bit and wait for a dip but you can never time the market.

2024-11-18,19:43:41,investing,"How do you determine your split ratio between different companies in the same industry? For example, in AI, I mainly have PLTR and NVDA in 10:1 ratio (in dollars). But I think I'm too heavy on the PLTR side.","I‚Äôve been thinking about my portfolio allocation strategy of PLTR and NVDA. It‚Äôs a simple metric, but it can give a good sense of how we‚Äôre positioning ourselves between two AI juggernauts. For me, I‚Äôm currently sitting at a 10:1 ratio. I believe its data-driven approach and its growing relevance in sectors like national defense, intelligence, and even healthcare give it a unique competitive edge for long-term growth. I'm seeing it as a large part of my 10+ year retirement holding.     
  
Obviouly, NVDA is the largest in the AI space, but I see it as more of a stable growth play due to its already dominant position in the AI market. I‚Äôve allocated less to NVDA because, while I believe in its long-term growth, the stock price is already higher, and I see PLTR as having more upside potential from its current valuation.

2024-11-12,19:05:57,investing,"MPWR should be in your portfolio, TODAY!","Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) has been a powerhouse in the semiconductor space for years, bringing top-tier power solutions across hot sectors like cloud, telecom, automotive, industrial, and consumer tech. Established back in ‚Äò97 out of Kirkland, WA, MPWR has built a solid rep as a go-to for high-performance power components.

**Recent Stock Action**

In October, MPWR traded in the $950 price range and as of November 12, 2024, MPWR is trading at $638.26, taking a hit of about 13.98% from the previous close. It saw an intraday high of $689.00 and bottomed out at $610.00. Price action lately has been choppy, but analysts are still very much on board with this stock.

**Analyst Ratings and Price Targets**

Despite the pullback, the Street remains bullish on MPWR. Here‚Äôs the rundown:

* **Truist Financial**: Analyst William Stein kept his ""Buy"" rating on October 31, boosting his target from $918 to $994.
* **Stifel Nicolaus**: Back on October 9, Stifel held the ""Buy"" call and upped the target to $1,100.
* **TD Cowen**: Matt Ramsay reiterated a ""Buy"" rating on October 31, tagging it with a $975 target.
* **Rosenblatt Securities**: Also bullish, reissuing a ""Buy"" on October 29 with an $880 target.
* **Needham & Company**: On November 11, Quinn Bolton reaffirmed his ""Buy"" rating with a $950 target.

With an average price target around $942.40, that‚Äôs roughly a 23% upside from here. MPWR is a consensus ""Strong Buy.""

**Latest Developments**

The stock took a 15% dive on November 11 after rumors hinted at MPWR losing some Nvidia business. Management fired back, denying any issues with Nvidia, and the analysts stepped in to support the stock. It‚Äôs a shake-up, but nothing management isn‚Äôt handling.

**The Bottom Line**

MPWR is still a major player with a strategic foothold in high-growth sectors. Despite the recent noise, analysts are holding steady on their bullish stance. For long-term growth in semis, MPWR has the fundamentals to keep driving forward.",NVDA,NVIDIA

2024-11-08,22:31:04,investing,Opinion of IG vs ETF for long-term investing? Numerical examples wanted!,"I'll try to keep this short.

I (31M) am in Canada and have a steady job with a pension, own my house, no large debts (besides mortgage and car), and have 47K in cash that I've been sitting on for far too long. I have played with stocks in the past on Questrade and have basically only come out slightly positive because of investments in Apple and AMD. I was suggested a financial advisor and started talking with one at IG Wealth Management.

Long story short: I'm getting cold feet at pulling the trigger with them. The portfolio they are suggesting is the iProfile Portfolio Global Equity Series F managed by Philip Petursson. Based on my aggressive investing stance, I'd be paying a 2.37% fee (MER of 1.01%). However this portfolio has nice returns after accounting for the fee (8.11 for 3YR, 28.01 for 1YR, 18.38 YTD).

But doing some quick maths it looks like the fees would cost me $300K over 25 years in fees (if I'm investing 10-12k a year). This does not account for a waived or decreased fee once you hit $250k, which would be around year 11 for me.

When I asked about these numbers they said that These funds are actively managed and you're paying for the available advice, as well as dampening losses in bad years, and overall a better return in the long run compared to index funds. They also said an expected growth per year is 7%.

I was also cautioned that ETFs have hidden fees that are not shown upfront...which from what I have read, is not true.

I know these advisors are salesmen that want to gain more clients. But I'm also aware that anyone can post their financial advice on reddit and act like it is the gospel while having no credentials to back it up.

So my question is: What are people's experiences with IG vs ETFs and self investing? Would people be willing to share their experiences with either ETFs or IG and give numerical examples to back up their stance?

2024-11-04,13:26:25,investing,"Boeing: Navigating Challenges, Securing Growth‚ÄîA Resilient Investment Opportunity in Aerospace","**Boeing as a Potential Investment Opportunity**

Boeing stands as one of the most important players in the aerospace industry, with a heavily established brand and legacy that commands trust around the world. Despite recent operational and financial challenges affecting its stock price, Boeing‚Äôs intrinsic value and reputation position it as a viable investment. While relatively short-term setbacks have impacted shareholder sentiment, these issues are likely irrelevant in terms of Boeing‚Äôs long-term prospects as a leader in aviation. For a company of Boeing‚Äôs stature, resilience and success are inevitable, making it a viable investment opportunity amidst doubt in the markets.

**Boeing‚Äôs Brand Strength and Market Perception**

Since its founding in 1916, Boeing has had a long-standing reputation for safety and reliability. The company has bolstered its reputation through engineering marvels like the Boeing 747. Although Boeing has recently had many notable incidents, they have focused on being transparent and open with its shareholders. For example, production issues with the 787 Dreamliner, delays in the 777X program, software glitches affecting 737 MAX deliveries, supply chain disruptions, and quality control concerns have been openly handled by the company as they have been in direct communication with the National Transportation Safety Board in order to improve and learn from their mistakes. Another key factor is brand loyalty. Boeing‚Äôs brand strength is comparable to companies such as Coca-Cola and Apple. This loyalty and strength has been based on customer trust, market stability, innovation, and collaboration. Ultimately, Boeing‚Äôs long-standing reputation allows it to build strong brand loyalty, further bolstering its position in the aerospace industry and ensuring its continued relevance and resilience in the market.¬†

Boeing has a huge brand name that involves years of experience in the market, which competitors like COMAC and others lack. Boeing also has government contracts on military vehicles, with the V-22 Osprey and Air Force One being two of the most well-known. Three years ago, Chinese airframer COMAC landed on the US government's blacklist of ‚Äúcommunist Chinese military companies,‚Äù where it could face sanctions and other boycotts. This shone a negative light on COMAC‚Äôs reliability. In combination with its long standing history of serving US citizens, Boeing is set far ahead of their competitors.

**Operational Challenges and Financial Setbacks**

Boeing has faced several operational and financial setbacks that have significantly impacted its stock price, including manufacturing delays and supply chain disruptions, particularly in the production of its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Additionally, protests from employees and labor unions over working conditions have strained internal dynamics, contributing to production slowdowns. Financially, Boeing has struggled with rising costs and has faced accusations of fraud and misleading investors, including a high-profile lawsuit related to the 737 Max crashes. These issues have collectively damaged investor confidence, further pressuring Boeing‚Äôs stock performance as it navigates these challenges.

Boeing‚Äôs financial strategy has recently centered on a significant $10 billion credit agreement aimed at facilitating recovery in the wake of industry challenges. This move not only addresses immediate liquidity needs but also signals confidence in long-term growth prospects. The funds are expected to support investment in new technologies and production capabilities, enhancing Boeing‚Äôs competitive position.¬†

**Sustained Market Demand for Aircraft**

Boeing‚Äôs $400 billion order backlog highlights sustained demand and supports financial stability amid challenges. Orders for key models like the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner show strong client confidence, positioning Boeing for recovery as it addresses production issues. This pipeline of demand reinforces Boeing‚Äôs market position, providing investors a solid foundation for long-term growth.¬†

The global demand for air travel has received significant growth over recent years, particularly in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia. Rising incomes, urbanization, economic growth, and an expanding middle class are driving increased travel in regions like China, India, and Southeast Asia, contributing to a broader shift in air travel trends. These areas are experiencing significant growth in demand, caused by economic expansion and government investments. China is on track to become the world‚Äôs largest aviation market by the mid-2030s, with massive infrastructure projects underway. India, supported by initiatives like UDAN, is expected to become the third-largest aviation market within a decade as air travel increasingly replaces other modes of domestic transport. In Southeast Asia, countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand are seeing strong growth, with low-cost carriers making flights more accessible. These regions will shape the future of global air travel, where infrastructure and sustainable technologies will be essential.

**Valuation and Investment Prospects**

Since its 52-week high, Boeing has dropped 40%. This fall in share price is due to ongoing production delays, regulatory challenges, weakened defense contract demand, broader economic concerns, and disruptions from recent labor strikes affecting suppliers. In 2019, the stock price was a staggering $430. This peak came before the 737-MAX crises and the COVID-19 Pandemic, Boeing has dropped nearly 65% since then. Through Boeing‚Äôs fall over the past 5 years, their competitors, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman have grown 85%, 75%, and 94%, respectively. Despite this divergence, Boeing still has a 15-20% market share in the Defense and Aerospace Industry domestically, in addition to their 45%-50% stake in Commercial Aviation as they are in a duopoly with Airbus. Additionally, Boeing's extensive order backlog signals strong demand, suggesting a potential path to recovery as global air travel rebounds. While challenges remain, addressing these operational hurdles could enable Boeing to leverage its dominant position in aerospace, driving a potential comeback toward pre-pandemic performance levels.

**Key Risk Factors Impacting Boeing**

Boeing has a number of regulation issues like the recertification of the 737 MAX which was heavily scrutinized by the FAA and other aviation authorities. The aircraft was allowed for flight but Boeing‚Äôs continuous oversight and compliance has been a focus since 2021. Boeing has also had production quality issues, specifically with the 787 Dreamliner having damaged parts, unsecured fuel lines, and multiple other issues. Additionally,in 2021, the European Union proposed stricter emissions standards which may affect Boeing‚Äôs future production practices. Boeing continues to be under investigation for various issues under the FAA and other global aviation authorities about lying to regulators about the safety of aircrafts and cutting corners.

Boeing's Defense and Space division has struggled with substantial challenges over recent years. Despite its strong foothold in defense, Boeing faces ongoing challenges including production delays and quality control concerns in key programs like the KC-46 Pegasus and P-8 Poseidon. Additionally, the company has struggled with significant cost overruns and navigating a competitive landscape. Despite this, Boeing is committed to innovation and improving efficiency, which is vital for securing future government contracts. On the other hand, marred by years of glitches, Boeing has also faced over $1.6 billion in cost overruns and delays in its space sector. Boeing‚Äôs Starliner project has faced many setbacks, while their rival, Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, has made 43 visits to the International Space Station since 2019. As a result, Boeing is considering selling this project and stepping away from the space sector after over 60 years in the industry. However, NASA and Boeing are actively working to solve these issues to get Starliner up and running once again, which, if successful, could diminish some concerns associated with the company‚Äôs future in the space sector.

**Boeing‚Äôs Path to Recovery and Future Outlook**

In conclusion, Boeing‚Äôs promising potential for recovery is characterized by two factors: its substantial market share/strong brand image and how harshly the market has reacted to the company's setbacks, ignoring major potential in the company‚Äôs extensive order backlogs. Boeing‚Äôs major losses, such as the pandemic-incited 737 MAX crisis, allegations of fraud in overstated production goals, federal investigation into regulatory non-compliance, and quality control issues across multiple aircraft models were largely managerial issues that are being priced in too harshly, ignoring the fact that Boeing maintains a notable global presence in the aerospace industry. Approximately 50% of the machine supply in the commercial aircraft market is due to Boeing, the other 50% belonging to Airbus with Boeing also controlling about 20% of the Defense and Aerospace Industry. These statistics emphasize the company‚Äôs strong presence, highlighting that the managerials issues of the past can be overcome.

Although Warren Buffett and we must always do our best to surpass our heroes like all Olympic records are meant to be broken (coz' in part technology, rule change and medicine advances) or NBA stars like MJ surpassing their heroes and Warren Buffett is still the genius compared to 93.% of investors and traders (the remaining 7% are the other stars like Peter Lynch), he's also made a few mistakes (Amazon is the best example coz' he always insists he doesn't understand technology which is honestly not that hard to understand but may be hard to see the road ahead when the internet was democratized including made affordable for the common working man with a decent salary ala Henry Ford's speech):

granted he loves CEOs and founders who have a laid back personality that are orthodox but orthodox in the big way, like Tim Cook, and granted TSLA is overbought by saying TSLA has the market cap of the auto industry combined vs. it's book value (math part of things, ruled by figures/number so it's more a part of technical analysis still), is he avoiding TSLA because:

a)  Elon Musk's personality is the biggest Think Big of all Think Bigs in the industrial history (way bigger than Henry Ford or Vanderbilt and the others who built industrial america which spilled to the world) and he's not comfortable with that

b) or is it because it's personal coz' they had a little war on words in the interviews and on X/formerly Twitter?

If it's about a) then it contradicts with his being on the Left mindset (a democrat, I'm with team common sense by the way at the moment coz' it has clarity, consistency and specific solutions) coz' the Left is very unorthodoxed and sometimes even comically non-sensical, going way beyond common sense.

If it's b) that's even worse, coz' one's judgment must not be clouded as Graham and Warren have though themselves, big decisions must be logical not ruled by vibes and emotions.

2024-11-03,10:42:17,investing,Buybacks or IPOs? Which is better as a retail investor?,"My take:

**Advantages of Buybacks**

**1. Boosting Share Value**: Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding, which can increase earnings per share (EPS) and can lead to a higher stock price.

Eg: Apple has a series of buybacks for billions of dollars that has benefitted a lot of shareholders.

**2. Boosting Investor Confidence**: Buybacks can boost investor sentiment. Investors interpret it as a sign that the company expects to perform well in the future.¬†¬†

**Advantages of IPOs**

**1. Growth Potential:**¬†IPOs provide an opportunity to invest in a company at an early stage, potentially reaping substantial rewards as the company grows.

**2. Market Sentiment:**¬†IPOs often attract considerable market attention and investor interest, which can lead to initial price surges.

Example:¬†Paras Defence was listed at a premium of 171% leading to instant gains for buyers in a short time. It does not end here. The share price surged by another 143% within 3 weeks giving more gains to the shareholders.

While buybacks are good for existing shareholders as they can sell their shares above the market price, IPOs provide decent prices for retail investors to accumulate shares in case they are able to get allocation for the applied IPO.

2024-10-28,16:01:39,investing,Need help with deploying capital,"Hey everyone,

So in a previous post about how I should be investing you guys in essence told me to continue to buy VTI. I have 26 shares of VTI in my Roth which is maxed for the year, and then in my taxable brokerage account I have 20 shares of VTI at an avg price of 286.27. I also have 50 shares of CMG and 38 shares of NVDA just for some additional context. I currently have 11.5k in cash I am looking to deploy. I don‚Äôt want to just buy all in VTI at once as I think that isn‚Äôt the smartest idea. I‚Äôm wondering how you guys think I should go about it. Should I set staggered buy orders at various prices? Also, should I use it all for VTI or should I hold some for other stuff? Any help would be appreciated ",NVDA,NVIDIA

2024-10-25,20:55:42,investing,Berkshire Hathaway as proxy cash holding?,"Disclaimer: I don't hold any BRK at this time (because I own A LOT of Apple).

* BRK.B is 983B USD, out of which, 277B USD is cash 
* That's \~70% in solid business and \~30% in cash.
* Cash grows \~5% per year.

Let's assume BRK stock holdings drop by 10% in a given year.

* BRK 10% drop in the stock holdings is 7% of their total holdings.
   * adjusted drop 7%.
* BRK cash grows \~5% per year, which is 1.5% of their total holdings.
   * adjusted drop 5.5%.
* BRK gets \~5B USD in dividends every year, which is 0.5% of their total holdings: adjusted drop 5%

Now, with a loss of 5%, BRK maybe realize some losses in order to offset capital gains, which would bring the actual loss even lower, let's say it drops another 0.5%, which makes the loss 4.5%.

Now, if BRK's holdings drop 4.5% and let's say you need to take 30% of the money from it:  
\- Now, BRK will buy more of their holdings.  
\- In order to recover the 4.5% of the 30% of the original money you've taken, the stock only needs to recover \~7% (which is not a lot, considering it just dropped 10%).

I did a more careful analysis of my trading account and found that YTD I have a 22.5% appreciation on the portfolio but it is \*significantly\* greater when I factored in the cash withdrawals I took, mostly to fund tuitions and home improvements. In addition to riding the AI wave, I have been shorting near expiry options to collect high premiums, sometimes rolling or taking delivery from puts in stocks I am positive on. and then writing covered calls.

2024-10-15,19:01:21,investing,"""frontier tech"" portfolio ","hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:

* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.
* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.
* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.
* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.
* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.
* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.

ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:

**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN

* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:
* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here.
* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).
* 15% mix of these...
   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation
   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large
   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership
   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership
   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership
   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now
* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.
* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.

**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR

* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that¬† diversification is the better long-term play.
* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.
* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.

**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR

* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:
* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.
* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.
* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.

**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.

ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.

2024-10-15,19:01:21,investing,"""frontier tech"" portfolio ","hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:

* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.
* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.
* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.
* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.
* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.
* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.

ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:

**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN

TSMC, as one of NVIDIA‚Äôs key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales. If TSMC reports strong earnings, it could indicate robust demand for semiconductors, which is crucial since NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC for manufacturing its GPUs. Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA‚Äôs prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA.

Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may¬†*revise*¬†their ratings or¬†***price targets***¬†for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a¬†**spike**¬†in NVDA‚Äôs stock price.

Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA‚Äôs growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors. Reports indicate that TSMC is now able to ship more chips than ever before.

How do you keep this urge/itch away? Just keeping it in S&P 500 is so boring. 

EDIT: based on comments I want to add that I do gamble in casinos table games but not more than $500-$1000 a year. It‚Äôs fun but I have the thinking that I will loose that 100%. The high from stocks which is 1k-10k gain in a short time is at another level. I don‚Äôt bet on penny stocks. These are mostly blue chip like when APPLE or AMAZON or CHIPOTLE does down, I would buy it and then sell in 1-6 months or just sit on it until it goes up. Sometimes stocks like NEO never go up.

EDIT: based on comments I want to add that I do gamble in casinos table games but not more than $500-$1000 a year. It‚Äôs fun but I have the thinking that I will loose that 100%. The high from stocks which is 1k-10k gain in a short time is at another level. I don‚Äôt bet on penny stocks. These are mostly blue chip like when APPLE or AMAZON or CHIPOTLE does down, I would buy it and then sell in 1-6 months or just sit on it until it goes up. Sometimes stocks like NEO never go up. I also only SELL options. ",AAPL,Apple
2024-10-07,16:03:21,investing,To sell or not sell long positions. Why or why not? ,"Hi everyone, this posit is about my holdings in NVDA & META. I would like to be a discussion on benefits of selling/holding long positions that are up significantly. I‚Äôm sure there are others in similar positions who may want to know. 

If this is too close to personal advice remove if necessary. 

I have been long on both these for a handful of years. 

META- 21 Shares @ $171.35 Avg Cost. 
Total return to date $8,932.00 (+247.56%) 

NVDA - 119.75 Shares @ $55.26 Avg Cost.
Total Return to date $8,450.00 (+127.87%)

My unrealized gains are getting up there. What‚Äôs invested in these + the unrealized gains are just over 1/3 of my portfolio. I am unsure if I should sell my positions and buy back in. Albeit at a higher price..seems kind of silly. I know it‚Äôs unlikely these will ‚Äúcrash‚Äù even a considerable market adjustment wouldn‚Äôt really affect my positions since I got in ‚Äúearly‚Äù. I am just nervous having all these unrealized gains. 

I don‚Äôt have to pay tax on these gains until sold, so I have been leaning to just letting it be and (hopefully) continue to grow. These companies have been beating earnings every quarter with no real tell tale signs of slowing‚Ä¶(maybe I‚Äôm wrong)

2024-10-06,17:23:08,investing,Is a Financial Advisor Necessary?,"So I've had a financial advisor for a while now, and I completely forgot about the account because since acquiring this advisor however many years ago, I've started doing my own investing now. I have a Roth IRA with fidelity that is managed by fidelity (under 25k has no fees, and above 25k is .35%.) Most of my money is in my brokerage account in things like Nvidia, AMD, and VOO. I also have growth stocks like RIVN that make up a much smaller percentage of my portfolio. My point is now that I've seen my own gains, and the Fidelity roth IRA is so cheap comparatively, is there even a reason to stick with a financial advisor? I have $2,500 with this guy (for comparison, I have 15k between my Roth / Brokerage / HYSA in fidelity) and frankly is there any reason I shouldn't just take that money and put it in my Roth? or brokerage account in VOO? I'm realizing that a financial advisor might be for the people that know literally nothing about investing and panic sell and buy / don't invest at all because they don't understand how investing works at all. I know the raw cost basis of having the advisor is more expensive, I'm not asking about the fees, but more so the gains that are possible personally, vs with an advisor.",NVDA,NVIDIA
2024-10-05,19:12:12,investing,American Funds generally exclude Nvidia. So disappointing.,"I inherited a sizable Roth IRA, and looked at the portfolio composition and was disappointed that Nvidia is not even a part of many of their funds.

The 4 funds that are in the portfolio have such a large overlap, it makes no sense why the financial planner would do this. The expense ratios are extremely high, and the holdings make no sense either:

[American Balanced Fund¬Æ (ABALX)](https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/investments/fund/ABALX) mostly Microsoft, Broadcom, and Google

[Capital Income Builder¬Æ (CAIBX)](https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/investments/fund/CAIBX) mostly Broadcom, Phillip Morris, and Abby Vie

[The Growth Fund of America¬Æ (AGTHX)](https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/investments/fund/AGTHX) mostly Microsoft, Meta, and Google (AHA...Nvidia is actually in there, but only at 3.5% of the fund)

[The Investment Company of America¬Æ (AIVSX)](https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/investments/fund/AIVSX) Microsoft, Broadcom, Microsoft, Google, Meta.

The amount of money that was ""lost"" by not having more more exposure to nvidia is absurd. Why don't their funds just track the S&P 500?

I plan to hold onto this Roth for the next 10 years, let it grow, then make a lump sum RMD, but I am very upset over the high expense ratios of about 0.63%.

I am considering selling these positions and buying just one good one that has more of nvidia. I really don't like these expense ratios and it almost feels like extortion.

I have also considered looking into an Inherited Roth IRA transfer to fidelity, if that's even possible. Is it even possible to transfer an inherited Roth IRA?",NVDA,NVIDIA

(20 down to 6)Some suggested that I take a leap of faith with a few companies I believe in. I did (ASTS/MSTR). Comments welcome.,"[With the outliers of November and December, I averaged around 500 monthly in dividends. ](https://preview.redd.it/0vlbq9vf39fe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f12e836db667f2f38e0ac557f7ee1d94d6c7c376)

Taxable brokerage account from 2024 was a long experiment in Dividends. I use a roughly 50/50 strategy of Dividends dynamically balanced against tech and Growth. The monthly dividends would reinvest in themselves if they weren't growing as fast as other funds, or they would reinvest in my higher risk/reward funds if they were.  


I utilize Margin on the higher risk/reward (usually 25% of the equity) and reinvested that back into the dividend portfolio to increase the dividends and help me maintain balance as the Risk/reward funds dipped (Namely, MSTR).

[Over the next 12 months, these dividends will increase to hopefully bring me to a place where ultimately I can retire early.](https://preview.redd.it/z4slx57z39fe1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=e937ac6e01c0caab568ce0a7f6f8ccd250dbd985)

[These are all of the funds in the portfolio and my cost basis per share. Note that AAPL and ASML are the only funds I hold with a lower yield on cost than the actual Yield. This means that the yield I got ended up being lower when you account for my cost. These were the only 'losers' that I kept in the portfolio, in an attempt to streamline, moving forward. ](https://preview.redd.it/znsckycg59fe1.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=2090862fe8ccf7bd2d2cb64aeef6d3462bf95dbf)

I like M1 because it shows me an overview of all my dividend stocks. I pruned out most of my Yieldmax stuff. I do use MSTY moderately in my Roth, but not anymore in my brokerage.   


[I think more people should look at CRF, SPE, ETJ, and ETY.](https://preview.redd.it/apfmeka969fe1.png?width=1204&format=png&auto=webp&s=14287a8b16361a3e88a8e248a484315dff476038)



You can stop reading here if you just want to discuss the portfolio. I have a bit more info and comparisons from CRF further down. Do your own research. Not financial Advice.

[Its got a pretty generic basket. I still have some overlap with my other funds and some straight stocks, but I am hiding from some capital gains at the moment.](https://preview.redd.it/b19d4gpo89fe1.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=94417a3926bfa5c072984e1b15d798b790a41597)

I wanted to compare CRF to SCHD and other standard indexes.   
From the bottom of the market in 2020, CRF is a clear winner vs SCHD.

I looked at the chart for common geopolitical events and zoomed in on October 2023 (Israel/Hamas war broke out) which was 15 months ago. CRF outperformed SPYI, DIVO,SCHD, and JEPQ.

2025-01-25,15:05:42,dividends,How do I use dividends to speed up retirement,"I've been exploring financial independence and early retirement for a while, and dividend investing has become my primary tool to achieve this goal. I wanted to share my strategy, what I‚Äôve accomplished so far, and hopefully hear about your approaches too!

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm building my portfolio:

Reinvesting all dividends
Every dollar I earn in dividends goes straight back into buying more shares. Compounding is a powerful force, and this strategy helps my income grow faster.

Focusing on companies with stable dividends
I prioritize companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Coca-Cola (KO), and McDonald‚Äôs (MCD) for their decades-long track record of steady payouts. They‚Äôre the foundation of my passive income.

Diversifying with ETFs
Funds like SCHD and JEPI give me exposure to a broad range of companies, balancing growth and income potential.

Adding REITs for monthly income
Realty Income (O) and STAG Industrial (STAG) pay monthly dividends, which feel like small wins every month and could cover expenses as my portfolio grows.

Including growth companies with dividends
I also hold Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). While their dividends aren‚Äôt as high as some others, I see long-term capital appreciation with a dividend bonus.

Right now, I need around $30,000 annually to cover basic expenses, and my portfolio has reached about 10% of that target. It feels great to see progress, even if it‚Äôs slow and steady!

I‚Äôd love to hear from you, what‚Äôs working well for you on your dividend journey? Which sectors or strategies do you think are best for long-term sustainability?",AAPL,Apple

2025-01-16,04:47:19,dividends,Canadian dividend investors insight appreciated for bank stocks,"this is currently my portfolio. i used to be an ETF investor just holding SPY/VFV for many years but decided to make a change and shoot for the stars. I‚Äôve decided to create a portfolio thats mainly focused on GROWTH plus giving me a few dividends along the way. My goal is to have a retirement portfolio that keeps growing itself and having dividends that I can live off of and spend without re-investment. When the growth stocks balloon, just rebalance and continue. I have picked these shares based off what I deem to believe are essential products carrying strong brand recognition, profit margins, cash flows, business models and history of growing dividends. 

I am a 26 year old canadian and my only debt is my mortgage (450k). I prefer to hold USD and thats why 99% of my cash is in USD besides the $1000 i added to RBC stock literally yesterday. That and WealthSimple does not allow you to purchase the american version of a stock if its also on TSX (which i find is rediculous). 

I am currently only holding AAPL and BRK.B in my TFSA. I max it every year. Currently adding $125/wk to BRK.B. I hold all of my dividend payers in RRSP and LIRA from my previous job for avoiding withholding tax on my US dividend paying securities. The only issue I have with this is when I will convert this into an RRIF and have to pay taxes on this income which is unavoidable. 

Anyways, this whole discussion is about one question: I am wondering if it would be a wiser choice to own BAC or RBC? Personally I am partial to owning american stocks, especially ones in the SP500. I like dividend stocks which protect (and grow) my capital and provide growing dividends. I know RBC has a great history and brand and checks all the boxes I am looking for. But I really want to own BAC for my american partiality. I just hate how the dividends will have withholding tax applied, as i am no longer planning on purchasing stock in my RRSP account going forward. I want to buy shares that I will never have to sell. Do you think over the long term of 30 years or so, BAC would be a better choice over RY? Or the other way around? Please explain why. 

Thanks for your clarity.

1. Is it worth to have pennies on some stocks? For instance, I invested about $5 in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) back in April 2023, which is now about $7. I never added to this ever since. Does it even make sense to hold this or should I continue to pour in this on a regular basis.
2. Furthermore, my $1100 of portfolio is in 26 different companies (e.g., Apple) and ETFs (e.g., SCHD). My friend was looking at this and told me that this is not the right approach, mainly due to point 1, as there are some stocks where I have little-to-no investment. So, what would be the more effective approach here: (a) focus all my money on fewer stocks and ETFs (if yes, is there a number)? or (b) am I doing it right by diversifying, regardless of how much I put in each of those.

My background: I started investing in January 2023 and until December 2024, I had only $500 worth of investment. In December 2024, idk why but I gained \*a lot of\* interest and poured $700 in different stocks and ETFs. My new year resolution is to invest regularly and on schedule.",AAPL,Apple

2025-01-03,17:30:54,dividends,Covered call high yield ETFs like NVDY,"So I've been researching this sub for reasons not to invest in something like $NVDY. 

And I understand the argument: it's better to just invest in the underlying stock, Nvidia, because its performance over the past year far exceeds the maybe 60% yield you might have gotten from NVDY.

However, going all in on one stock is inherently risky, and trading some of that risk for more sure income in the short-term (next 12-24 months) seems like a worthy trade off, is it not?

Especially if I have other high-yield dividend investments that are only giving me 10% or so since they're lower risk than a covered call strategy.

To me, NVDY would be like a major upgrade in my dividend income strategy while not being as scary and risky as going all in on one individual Nvidia position.

Am I thinking about this wrong? What are your thoughts?

People say high yield ETFs are ""too good to be true"" but clearly it's just a less-risky way to make money off a single stock, which is what covered calls are. I'm outsourcing covered calls to a fund manager and collecting the profits.

2025-01-01,22:11:58,dividends,"YieldMax ETFs and share price (""NAV"") erosion","**The images in this post are best viewed on a computer monitor or laptop, not a phone.**

Happy New Year! Since there are frequent posts asking for ""thoughts"" on MSTY and other YieldMax ETFs, I will share my thoughts on YieldMax ETFs. I'll put the TLDR at the beginning instead of at the end.

***TLDR: you can make money with YieldMax ETFs, but in almost every case you would make more money in the corresponding (""underlying"") stock. Most YieldMax ETFs suffer share price declines (""NAV erosion"") that drag on total return and can lock you into or trap you in the funds, forcing you to take a loss if you sell. YieldMax ETFs are most suitable for retired people who already have a lot of money and actually need the income, not young people who are working, earning money at their jobs, and have modest portfolios that need to grow.***

* YieldMax ETFs are a relatively new family of funds (the oldest TSLY started in November 2022, the newest started in December 2024) that have attracted attention because of their high distribution (""dividend"") yields
* All of the funds trade call and put options on actual stocks and ETFs like NVDA, MSFT, COIN, MSTR, ARKK, etc.  None of the YieldMax ETFs except ULTY, YMAG, and YMAX actually own the stocks or ETFs on which they trade options. YMAX and YMAG are ""funds of funds"" that own other YieldMax ETFs, and ULTY owns some actual stocks and ETFs.
* Except for ULTY, none of the money (""dividends"") that YieldMax ETFs distribute to shareholders comes from actual dividends. Many of the stocks the ETFs track - like TSLA and AMZN - don't even pay dividends. Even if the stocks do pay dividends - like AAPL and MSFT - Yieldmax ETFs don't own any shares of the stock so they aren't entitled to the dividends the stocks pay. All of the money (""dividends"") that YieldMax ETFs distribute to shareholders of the funds comes from trading options and from interest collected from US Treasury Notes that the funds hold.
* Because of the way the ETFs are constructed, they tend to not capture the full gains of the stock they are tracking. If MSTR goes down, MSTY goes down too. If MSTR goes up, MSTY goes up too, but not as much as MSTR. As the YieldMax fund managers themselves explain:

>**The Fund‚Äôs strategy will cap its potential gains if MSTR shares increase in value. The Fund‚Äôs strategy is subject to all potential losses if MSTR shares decrease in value, which may not be offset by income received by the Fund. The Fund may not be suitable for all investors.** [https://www.yieldmaxetfs.com/msty/](https://www.yieldmaxetfs.com/msty/)

* Because of the way YieldMax ETFs are constructed, if the stock it is tracking is generally rising in price - and the YieldMax ETF managers have picked stocks that tend to rise in price, like NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, etc. to track with their ETFs - the share price of the Yieldmax ETF will lag farther and farther and farther behind the stock it is tracking as time goes on, even to the point the YieldMax ETF shares are not only not gaining as much as the stock it is tracking but are actually losing value - ""NAV erosion"" - despite the fact the stock it is tracking is rising in price. For example, here is the share price of TSLY (blue line) - the oldest YieldMax ETF so it has had more time to fall behind the stock it tracks - compared to the share price of TSLA (red line)

[https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/4/45sDO8uu.png](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/4/45sDO8uu.png)

Since TSLY's inception in November 2022, TSLA's shares are up +120% and TSLY's shares are down -64%. TSLY even had to do a 2:1 reverse split in February 2024 to keep the price from being scary low.

Since CONY's inception in August 2023 it's share price is down -34% (blue line) while during the same time period COIN's shares are up +213% (red line).

[https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/bU9S2eRS.png](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/bU9S2eRS.png)

Even when a YieldMax ETF like MSTY hasn't had any share price (""NAV"") erosion - yet - it's share price gain has lagged far behind that of MSTR, the stock it tracks.

Since MSTY's inception in February 2024 its shares are up only +24% (blue line) while MSTR's shares (red line) are up +306%

[https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/OIPSU72a.png](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/OIPSU72a.png)

* Most YieldMax ETFs have suffered share price declines - ""NAV erosion"" - since their inception, but some are much worse than others. This chart shows the share price action for several popular YieldMax ETFs since their inceptions. I included the S&P 500 index (VOO) price action since the November 2022 inception of the oldest YieldMax ETF (TSLY) as a benchmark and reference. The chart is busy because of the number of ETFs but look at the numbers on the right edge of the chart for each ETF.

[https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/RjeIvE2L.png](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/RjeIvE2L.png)

If you have trouble reading the chart the results are

* VOO +47.70%
* the following have share price increases, although far below the stocks they track
* PLTY +37.47% (PLTR +82.46% during the same time)
* MSTY +24.15% (MSTR +306.11% during the same time)
* NVDY +17.27% (NVDA +369.91% during the same time)
* and then they go increasingly negative (share price ""NAV"" erosion)
* YMAG -3.24%
* TSMY -5.15% (TSM +15.19%)
* AMZY -6.19% (AMZN +69.90%)
* FBY -7.64% (META +79.89%)
* NFLY -8.90% (NFLX +103.36%)
* JPMO -9.70% (JPM +63.80%)
* MSFO -9.91% (MSFT +30.50%)
* APLY -10.68 (AAPL +50.43%)
* YMAX -14.82%
* GOOY -27.71% (GOOG +43.18%)
* CONY -34.03% (COIN +213.59%)
* YBIT -39.51% (BTC +40.56%)
* AMDY -49.45% (AMD +18.88%)
* ULTY -53.64%
* TSLY -64.40% (TSLA +120.44%)

As you can see, in most cases while the stocks that YieldMax ETFs track were going up up up, the share prices of YieldMax ETFs were going down down down.

In general, when you invest, you want to buy shares that go up in price, not down. Buy low and sell high. You can't sell high if the price went down.

* Since dividend yield is inversely related to share price - as share price goes down, dividend yield goes up - part of the reason YieldMax ETFs have such high yields is because as the share price went down, the yield went up, even if the dividend per share stayed the same.
* Yes, but what about the ""dividends""?! ""I'm making so much money every month from YMAX, who cares if the share price is going down!"" some might say. ""I'm taking the YieldMax ""dividends"" and using them to buy SCHD"" others might say. Well, the problem with declining share price (""NAV erosion"") it guarantees you will take a loss if you sell your YieldMax ETF shares. If you don't want to take that loss by selling it locks you in or traps you in that YieldMax ETF. You will take a loss if you sell your shares because you need the money for something, or you want to move that money to a better investment, even another YieldMax ETF, or if the YieldMax ETF no longer fits your needs or risk tolerance.
* But don't the ""dividends"" make up for the dropping share price? Well, as we know or should know, **total return** is the combination of share price increase (or decrease) and reinvested dividends (if any). Even though YieldMax share prices in general go down, don't all those dividends make up for it? Well, in most cases they help offset the negative effect of dropping share price on total return, but not enough to make up for all of it. Even with all those dividends you would have more gains investing in the actual stock - NVDA, MSTR, COIN - than in the YieldMax ETFs *even with the dividends*.

* For those who are using YieldMax ETFs to ""feed"" purchases of SCHD or other funds, in most cases you would have more money to invest in SCHD and other funds if you had invested in the actual stock that the YiekdMax ETF tracks than in the YieldMax ETF that tracks the stock, and sold a dollar amount of shares every month or quarter or whatever.
* So, are there circumstances where YieldMax ETFs make sense? As the YieldMax ETF fund managers point out:

>**The Fund may not be suitable for all investors.**

So who are YieldMax ETFs suitable for? Well, not young people who want/need to grow their portfolios. As I have shown, they would have more gains/make more money investing in the actual stocks - NVDA, NFLX. MSTR, etc. - than in the YieldMax ETFs - NVDY, NFLY, MSTY - that track the stocks. But sadly, it looks like lots of young people are only looking at the high dividend yield of YieldMax ETFs and aren't paying attention to share price declines (""NAV erosion"") and total return. They are making gains, but not as much as they could be making.

* In my opinion, YieldMax ETFs are suitable for people who already have 6 or 7 or 8 figure portfolios, are living on their investments and need income, who want income from options trading without having to sell covered calls or get involved with options trading personally, and already have lots of money and can tolerate the share price declines (""NAV erosion"").

None of the above means I ""hate dividends"" or I'm ""anti-dividends"". I collected over $61k in dividends in 2024. I'm not even anti-YieldMax ETFs per se, when it is appropriate for the investor. I have 2.73% of my portfolio in NVDY, but I'm one of those people I described who already has a large portfolio after years of investing, who is near retirement and needs the income, and who doesn't want to trade options. ""But you said own the stock instead of the YieldMax ETF, what a hypocrite!"" some might think. Well I do own NVDA stock as well. NVDA is 13.77% of my portfolio, much larger than my NVDY position.

It's your money, invest in whatever you want. But it makes sense before you invest your hard-earned money to understand what you are investing in so you know if it makes sense for you. Don't just look at dividend yield.

2025-01-01,22:11:58,dividends,"YieldMax ETFs and share price (""NAV"") erosion","**The images in this post are best viewed on a computer monitor or laptop, not a phone.**

Happy New Year! Since there are frequent posts asking for ""thoughts"" on MSTY and other YieldMax ETFs, I will share my thoughts on YieldMax ETFs. I'll put the TLDR at the beginning instead of at the end.

***TLDR: you can make money with YieldMax ETFs, but in almost every case you would make more money in the corresponding (""underlying"") stock. Most YieldMax ETFs suffer share price declines (""NAV erosion"") that drag on total return and can lock you into or trap you in the funds, forcing you to take a loss if you sell. YieldMax ETFs are most suitable for retired people who already have a lot of money and actually need the income, not young people who are working, earning money at their jobs, and have modest portfolios that need to grow.***

* YieldMax ETFs are a relatively new family of funds (the oldest TSLY started in November 2022, the newest started in December 2024) that have attracted attention because of their high distribution (""dividend"") yields
* All of the funds trade call and put options on actual stocks and ETFs like NVDA, MSFT, COIN, MSTR, ARKK, etc.  None of the YieldMax ETFs except ULTY, YMAG, and YMAX actually own the stocks or ETFs on which they trade options. YMAX and YMAG are ""funds of funds"" that own other YieldMax ETFs, and ULTY owns some actual stocks and ETFs.
* Except for ULTY, none of the money (""dividends"") that YieldMax ETFs distribute to shareholders comes from actual dividends. Many of the stocks the ETFs track - like TSLA and AMZN - don't even pay dividends. Even if the stocks do pay dividends - like AAPL and MSFT - Yieldmax ETFs don't own any shares of the stock so they aren't entitled to the dividends the stocks pay. All of the money (""dividends"") that YieldMax ETFs distribute to shareholders of the funds comes from trading options and from interest collected from US Treasury Notes that the funds hold.
* Because of the way the ETFs are constructed, they tend to not capture the full gains of the stock they are tracking. If MSTR goes down, MSTY goes down too. If MSTR goes up, MSTY goes up too, but not as much as MSTR. As the YieldMax fund managers themselves explain:

>**The Fund‚Äôs strategy will cap its potential gains if MSTR shares increase in value. The Fund‚Äôs strategy is subject to all potential losses if MSTR shares decrease in value, which may not be offset by income received by the Fund. The Fund may not be suitable for all investors.** [https://www.yieldmaxetfs.com/msty/](https://www.yieldmaxetfs.com/msty/)

* Because of the way YieldMax ETFs are constructed, if the stock it is tracking is generally rising in price - and the YieldMax ETF managers have picked stocks that tend to rise in price, like NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, etc. to track with their ETFs - the share price of the Yieldmax ETF will lag farther and farther and farther behind the stock it is tracking as time goes on, even to the point the YieldMax ETF shares are not only not gaining as much as the stock it is tracking but are actually losing value - ""NAV erosion"" - despite the fact the stock it is tracking is rising in price. For example, here is the share price of TSLY (blue line) - the oldest YieldMax ETF so it has had more time to fall behind the stock it tracks - compared to the share price of TSLA (red line)

[https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/4/45sDO8uu.png](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/4/45sDO8uu.png)

Since TSLY's inception in November 2022, TSLA's shares are up +120% and TSLY's shares are down -64%. TSLY even had to do a 2:1 reverse split in February 2024 to keep the price from being scary low.

Since CONY's inception in August 2023 it's share price is down -34% (blue line) while during the same time period COIN's shares are up +213% (red line).

[https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/bU9S2eRS.png](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/bU9S2eRS.png)

Even when a YieldMax ETF like MSTY hasn't had any share price (""NAV"") erosion - yet - it's share price gain has lagged far behind that of MSTR, the stock it tracks.

Since MSTY's inception in February 2024 its shares are up only +24% (blue line) while MSTR's shares (red line) are up +306%

[https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/OIPSU72a.png](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/OIPSU72a.png)

* Most YieldMax ETFs have suffered share price declines - ""NAV erosion"" - since their inception, but some are much worse than others. This chart shows the share price action for several popular YieldMax ETFs since their inceptions. I included the S&P 500 index (VOO) price action since the November 2022 inception of the oldest YieldMax ETF (TSLY) as a benchmark and reference. The chart is busy because of the number of ETFs but look at the numbers on the right edge of the chart for each ETF.

[https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/RjeIvE2L.png](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/RjeIvE2L.png)

If you have trouble reading the chart the results are

* VOO +47.70%
* the following have share price increases, although far below the stocks they track
* PLTY +37.47% (PLTR +82.46% during the same time)
* MSTY +24.15% (MSTR +306.11% during the same time)
* NVDY +17.27% (NVDA +369.91% during the same time)
* and then they go increasingly negative (share price ""NAV"" erosion)
* YMAG -3.24%
* TSMY -5.15% (TSM +15.19%)
* AMZY -6.19% (AMZN +69.90%)
* FBY -7.64% (META +79.89%)
* NFLY -8.90% (NFLX +103.36%)
* JPMO -9.70% (JPM +63.80%)
* MSFO -9.91% (MSFT +30.50%)
* APLY -10.68 (AAPL +50.43%)
* YMAX -14.82%
* GOOY -27.71% (GOOG +43.18%)
* CONY -34.03% (COIN +213.59%)
* YBIT -39.51% (BTC +40.56%)
* AMDY -49.45% (AMD +18.88%)
* ULTY -53.64%
* TSLY -64.40% (TSLA +120.44%)

As you can see, in most cases while the stocks that YieldMax ETFs track were going up up up, the share prices of YieldMax ETFs were going down down down.

In general, when you invest, you want to buy shares that go up in price, not down. Buy low and sell high. You can't sell high if the price went down.

* Since dividend yield is inversely related to share price - as share price goes down, dividend yield goes up - part of the reason YieldMax ETFs have such high yields is because as the share price went down, the yield went up, even if the dividend per share stayed the same.
* Yes, but what about the ""dividends""?! ""I'm making so much money every month from YMAX, who cares if the share price is going down!"" some might say. ""I'm taking the YieldMax ""dividends"" and using them to buy SCHD"" others might say. Well, the problem with declining share price (""NAV erosion"") it guarantees you will take a loss if you sell your YieldMax ETF shares. If you don't want to take that loss by selling it locks you in or traps you in that YieldMax ETF. You will take a loss if you sell your shares because you need the money for something, or you want to move that money to a better investment, even another YieldMax ETF, or if the YieldMax ETF no longer fits your needs or risk tolerance.
* But don't the ""dividends"" make up for the dropping share price? Well, as we know or should know, **total return** is the combination of share price increase (or decrease) and reinvested dividends (if any). Even though YieldMax share prices in general go down, don't all those dividends make up for it? Well, in most cases they help offset the negative effect of dropping share price on total return, but not enough to make up for all of it. Even with all those dividends you would have more gains investing in the actual stock - NVDA, MSTR, COIN - than in the YieldMax ETFs *even with the dividends*.

* For those who are using YieldMax ETFs to ""feed"" purchases of SCHD or other funds, in most cases you would have more money to invest in SCHD and other funds if you had invested in the actual stock that the YiekdMax ETF tracks than in the YieldMax ETF that tracks the stock, and sold a dollar amount of shares every month or quarter or whatever.
* So, are there circumstances where YieldMax ETFs make sense? As the YieldMax ETF fund managers point out:

>**The Fund may not be suitable for all investors.**

So who are YieldMax ETFs suitable for? Well, not young people who want/need to grow their portfolios. As I have shown, they would have more gains/make more money investing in the actual stocks - NVDA, NFLX. MSTR, etc. - than in the YieldMax ETFs - NVDY, NFLY, MSTY - that track the stocks. But sadly, it looks like lots of young people are only looking at the high dividend yield of YieldMax ETFs and aren't paying attention to share price declines (""NAV erosion"") and total return. They are making gains, but not as much as they could be making.

* In my opinion, YieldMax ETFs are suitable for people who already have 6 or 7 or 8 figure portfolios, are living on their investments and need income, who want income from options trading without having to sell covered calls or get involved with options trading personally, and already have lots of money and can tolerate the share price declines (""NAV erosion"").

None of the above means I ""hate dividends"" or I'm ""anti-dividends"". I collected over $61k in dividends in 2024. I'm not even anti-YieldMax ETFs per se, when it is appropriate for the investor.

- Google, Microsoft, AMZN, Costco, Meta (long term growth to buy now/within the next month) 
- NVIDIA and TSLA for next 3-5 years with AI and Tech growth but idk bout long term. I‚Äôm not big on Apple. 
- Palantir and Sofi (riskier but long term good plays?)

Please let me know your information and suggestions based on your portfolio/experiences. Thank you all!",AAPL,Apple

2024-12-21,20:30:55,dividends,Kraft Heinz (KHC) analysis,"I‚Äôve seen lately people post about KHC about its dividend and ask if it‚Äôs a good dividend stock to get into. I am excited to finally speak on this topic as I‚Äôve been holding the stock for over two years now.

Get ready to learn about one of the most exciting and exhilarating stocks in the market. NVDA? Doesn‚Äôt stack up to KHC. AMZN? Childs play to KHC. Buckle up and get ready for this giant and be ready to be smitten.

Spoiler TLDR‚Ä¶ KHC is kind of lame.

Kraft Heinz is a stock where when the merger happened between Kraft and Heinz back in 2015 this was going to be a food giant with a plethora of brands under their umbrella. The phrase of ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù is what I thought when I heard the news originally.

Fast forward to 2024 and this merger has not created a superstar company. From the accusations from the SEC regarding their accounting. To the billions of dollars they took in write offs in their brands after the merger and having to sell some of their brands like Planters. It hasn‚Äôt gone well for them. Don‚Äôt take my word for it look at the numbers.

**Volume and Price changes**

https://preview.redd.it/pf8bi83w898e1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=25cb24959386065826f246c2ff4841308c0e1e3c



From 2019 to 2020 Kraft Heinz saw a 3.4% increase in volume for their products while they did a 3.1% increase on price. After that period of 2019 to 2020 that was the last time we can see volume increased. Since then volume has decreased but the company has continued to increase prices.

If you look at other packaged foods stocks (GIS, CAG, SJM, etc) you see the same trend where sales have been stalling or slow to grow while these companies have had to increase prices. From a cumulative analysis looking at the data above from 2019 to Q3 of 2024 KHC has increased prices by 29.1% while volume has decreased by 9.3%.

**Sales/Income**

Here we can see that Kraft Heinz has seen net sales stay pretty consistent. Growth in 2020 but since then very minimal growth. It screams a company that is stuck trying to get traction and gain momentum.

https://preview.redd.it/6hln7o0y898e1.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec4ba87641a7153a5322bbc5517f7a525005adc9

**Cashflow**

One thing to notice with Kraft Heinz Cash flow is the amount of long term debt that has been paid off. In 2019 they were carrying 29 billion in debt. And currently from the last Q3 earnings they had about 20 billion in debt. They have reduced their debt but their operation has generated lower cash which can be attributable to their declining sales as well as them selling off some of their brands like Planters in an attempt to reduce their portfolio size. They did announce last year that they were going to start share buybacks which is nice to see as they were not doing that when they were focused on debt.

**The market**

Personally I thought with inflation over the past few years I thought the stocks focused on at home food would thrive. However that hasn‚Äôt been the case. I pulled a few packaged foods stocks to show that from Jan of 2020 to now you can see a majority of them have seen their Market Cap go down. KHC you can say ‚Äúwell they their market cap has increased since then‚Äù but with only a 2% gain in market cap in the past almost 5 years why even invest in them? The reality is that inflation didn‚Äôt just impact the fast food industry, it impacted groceries and these stocks products. The problem with a majority of these companies has been a push to increase prices to offset declining/slow volume and consumers pushed back. With this pushback look at companies with large private labels (Walmart, Costco, and Kroger) since Jan of 2020 they have seen their market caps increased by 131%, 214%, and 108% respectively. All of these companies also pay dividends as well albeit at a lower yield% but the growth in these stocks has severely outpaced any dividends gained by the food stocks I listed previously let alone KHC.

Company Market cap in Millions (except for % change).

**Bear case against KHC**

The bear case against KHC is that they cant grow and they have shown a lack of growth. With so much of their portfolio being processed or packaged foods and with a majority of the US trying to be more health conscious nothing in their portfolio screams ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. One of their specific market is also now facing competition. Say what you want about Lunchly and the controversy behind it but its back by influencers that have a target audience. The same target audience that KHC‚Äôs Lunchables also focus on. There are also rumors of KHC trying to get rid of their Oscar Meyer brand. Another brand to offload as they juggle their portfolio to figure out what can be successful. Honestly if Warren Buffet/Berkshire cut their loses and sells this off that would be brutal as they are one of the largest holders of it.

**Bull case for KHC**

Though the past few paragraphs have bashed this stock there are two sides to every story.¬† KHC as stated had a lot of debt and they have done a great job at reducing it helping their balance sheet and their Cashflow. The same argument against Oscar Meyer can be a positive as they recognize brands that are not performing well and focus on other items. I do feel KHC in the past two years has tried experimenting with their products and focusing on what they can change from brand changes to adding new products. Some products like their Signature series of thick cut shredded cheese I think was a fresh addition to their product line that is something they should have done a while ago. I have seen more ads from their products lately compared to prior years so I feel this is not only due to the decline in sales, but also with their balance sheet getting rid of so much debt I feel that is why are looking more into marketing and R&D.

Ultimately I think this is a company stuck in neutral. A turnaround for them isn‚Äôt going to happen overnight its going to be a process. Looking at the earnings call presentations and listening to key notes I do believe the company is trying to lay the pieces in place to turnaround the company like focusing on their market share in the workplace food services. But some of their actions plans I am skeptical. launches of limited time Mac and Cheese flavors such as Jalapeno and Everything Bagel. I question how much these limited run items generate profit when most of you reading this probably haven‚Äôt even heard of those items. If their intent is to gather data on consumer preferences why not just utilize a test kitchen environment with participants vs on depending on orders from consumers when you need to market that product to them.

Personally people looking at this stock for a dividend because its yield is over 5% right now I think need to look and understand that they have been paying $1.60 a year since 2019 and since 2020 its been paying out between 3% and 5% which one can say ‚Äúwow what a consistent dividend‚Äù which is true. But this also paints how the company isn‚Äôt able to keep sustained growth. There are a plethora of other stocks or ETFs that pay a dividend at a lower yield then KHC but have returned to shareholders growth in the value of stock that surpasses the dividends of KHC.",NVDA,NVIDIA
2024-12-21,17:08:36,dividends,The Marathon Continues ,"I remember seeing a quote by Warren Buffet back in 20219 that said something like, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt find a way to make money in your sleep you‚Äôll work until you‚Äôre dead.‚Äù So, in January of 2020 I took the big leap!

I built my first portfolio in 2020 and added to it as much as I could (I was broke college kid). In 2021, I found stable work and decided I wanted to grow this portfolio so I added $20 every single day for the entire year.

The idea is to maintain growth even if they lose some partnerships. This might be also a good way to avoid repeating controversies as they had a few years ago.  
  


In 2017, Qualcomm was accused of anti-competitive practices and only targeting big companies like Apple, offering them reduced fees. When this news came out, investors sued them for the stock drop caused by this.



But the good news now is that they agreed to pay $75M to investors to solve this huge mess. And, I just found out that they are taking claims after the deadline, so if you got hit back then, you can check here if you are eligible and [file for the payment](https://11thestate.com/cases/qualcomm-investor-settlement).

This is my total portfolio and holdings. Basically I busted my ass to get this thing to almost 30,000. I feel I have apple and tech in like every position. And can loose my butt in things if a market correction. The CSP are against a cash collateral of 10,000 dollars. Looks like there gonna do ok and expire in 12/27. As you can see , I have a trailing stop loss on tqqq, and stop losses on the high dividend plays. I put the trailing stop loss with a margin of 10%, and hard stop losses of 5 percent below my purchase price. All positions have about a 8 percent move to the upside so I have a wiggle room for ‚Äúnoise‚Äù and stay in the position. 

What would you do? Else to guard, defend the portfolio/castle from invaders! 

Was thinking of selling QQQ, it‚Äôs a small position, or I can buy up to 1 share and put a trailing stop loss on this position as well? I guess you have to have a complete share not partials to put stop losses on Robinhood.

2024-12-13,13:18:37,dividends,Dividend growth mix,"Hey guys, 

I posted something similar in a few other threads. I value all opinions. 

I‚Äôm 32:
52K Gross
TSP account 35Kish

Stock account- 15-20k in McDonalds Stock
Trust I just received- 75K made up of:
Starbucks: 350 shares
Apple-56 shares 
The some Berkshire, Meta, and Intel. 
There‚Äôs also 12k in SNXX I believe so the whole value is 89K. 

I also have 220K ish in crypto. 
I also have 6 month emergency fund. 

Grew up with my uncle teaching me the importance of dividends. I know from some threads I‚Äôm on, some investors focus more on the growth side of things.  I‚Äôm also newer to the idea of ETFs, and like the broad coverage. 

Regarding the crypto, I moved back in with my parents 5 years ago after college for a short time, that‚Äôs when I discovered it. I dumped a bunch of paychecks into different coins and have held since.  Sure you can call it speculative and volatile, but it‚Äôs here to stay and sure as hell isn‚Äôt going anywhere.  Like my stock investing strategy, I have invested in utility tokens that have real world use cases.  Currently crypto is in a bull market.  

I have a vision of how I want the next 5 years to go, if my crypto portfolio goes above 500K, I‚Äôll sell a majority, and purchase some land in which I‚Äôll have my girlfriends dad build tiny houses for Airbnb rentals. I‚Äôll then invest the rest into the stock market. 

I don‚Äôt want to work until I‚Äôm 60-65 and I‚Äôd like to get to a point where I have real estate income, dividend income and I can work part time for the insurance and even still get a small TSP/401K contribution. 

So if you were in my position, how would you invest? I don‚Äôt have the cash now from my salary to make any kind of significant dividend investment so again that would come from the remaining crypto proceeds once that‚Äôs invested. But I have some funds that I can work with.  I was thinking maybe a 80/20 mix of VOO/SCHD? And adding in individual stocks along the way that I like?

Thanks for the feedback, I know that I am here seeking advice, but I‚Äôm not at all interested in what anyone has to say about the speculative nature or risks of crypto.  I‚Äôve been hearing that for 5 years, from family/friends and even financial advisors.  I can‚Äôt imagine if I had listened. ",AAPL,Apple

What are your thoughts on Johnson, Tesla, and Netflix? Protectionism could impact the technology sector since a significant portion of tech components is imported from China?",TSLA,Tesla
2024-12-12,23:50:18,dividends,Do you think NVIDIA stock is a speculation bubble?,"I'm uncertain, but NVIDIA seems like a speculative bubble to me. I believe the time to buy has already passed, and the current price is irrational, driven by market euphoria and the blind greed of inexperienced investors. I expect a price correction soon, which could lead to significant losses for many. Additionally, the lack of historical performance for this stock makes me hesitant to invest. What do you all think? Am I mistaken? I'd like to hear your thoughts on this topic.",NVDA,NVIDIA
2024-12-11,08:22:05,dividends,How's my portfolio?,"Hi I‚Äôm 42 and in Australia and my portfolio is pitifully small and quite frankly embarrassing. I am trying to build up as much as I can while I‚Äôm working to get myself a decent return via dividends and investment value growth. I only started 3 years ago and only have approximately 14k spread over 135 investments with a current return of around 20%. It consists of a mix of ETFs and Individual stocks ‚Äì 25% ETFs and 75% individual stocks as per below. At the moment I can only afford to invest $75 per week but I am aiming to increase that to $100 per week next year. I reinvest any dividends I earn. I also contribute $30 per week to my super too which is only 220k at the moment. I have a crytpo portfolio of around 10k ‚Äì should be double that but I lost half to an exchange that went under and I don‚Äôt actively invest any cash into crypto but I am constantly adding to crypto via mining. My strategy at the moment is to invest in my 2 top performers of individual stocks each week and 2 top performers of ETF stocks each week. The best one of each get‚Äôs 40% of my investment and the 2^(nd) best each get 10%. I‚Äôll occasionally buy something else that I read about or can see a future for. I recently sold a heap of my worst performers and reinvested those into my best performers. If I see solid movements up over a few weeks of some of my poorer performers I‚Äôll focus on buying up on those to catch the ride up then revert back to focusing on my best performers. I am always reading up on different companies and new breakthroughs within industries and public trends to help with where I invest too. I am a long term holder and don‚Äôt have time or any aspiration to day trade. I am looking for a minimum of 10 to 15 years and will increase my input over this time when I can afford to. I don't want to get to retirement and not have enough to live out the rest of my years so I'm doing what I can to accumulate as much as I can while I'm working. I want to get to a point where dividends contribute more to my portfolio than what I invest out of my own pocket. What should I focus on investing in out of what I have here to achieve this? With me not knowing anything about investing is what I have done any good or am I doing it all wrong?

2024-12-11,02:44:24,dividends,Thoughts on NVDY?,"According to their website, pays a 64% yield. I downloaded their holdings. Seems like they‚Äôre collecting premiums from NVDA puts then doing call spreads. It seems to trade within a relatively tight window (between $20 and $31 per share in its short 19-month lifetime). Seems like a decent income investment. Am I missing something?",NVDA,NVIDIA
2024-12-09,22:06:11,dividends,DIVB+DGRO as compliment to SCHD,"I was hoping to get some opinions on a dividend portfolio that is 50% SCHD, 25% DGRO and 25% DIVB (as opposed to SCHD/DGRO 50/50). The thinking is that DGRO and DIVB are both more tech focused then SCHD and make a good compliment to SCHD, but individually DGRO and DIVB seem to focus on different types of tech companies (Cisco and IBM) vs Microsoft and Apple. DIVB is not as much of a steady dividend grower as DGRO but returns have been slightly better, starting yield is a little higher right now, also very low expense ratio - 0.05%.

I am currently earning good money and I would like a percentage of my wages to be heavily invested for long term returns.
I currently have in my portfolio BP, VWRL, VUSA, VUKE and LVMH.

Was wondering the best dividend stocks? I would prefer something that not only pays a dividend, but is cheap and has the potential to grow in value.

Anybody here tracking QCOM? Basically they have wonderful plans to move past Apple (they are scheduled to lose a chunk of their business there) with a move towards the PC, auto, and IOT markets. Right now the share price seems to be drifting as investors just wait for more clarity.

If this was a growth portfolio I would be fine with that, it is just a risk datapoint to balance. But as part of my dividends portfolio I'm second guessing my choice. 2.08% yield is just too low to grow into anything meaningful anytime soon. ",AAPL,Apple

For newbies, back in 2017, Qualcomm was accused of anti-competitive practices and only targeting big companies like Apple, offering them reduced fees. When this news came out, investors sued them for the stock drop caused by this.



But the good news now is that they agreed to pay $75M to investors to solve this huge mess. And, I just found out that they are taking claims after the deadline, so if you got hit back then, you can check here if you are eligible and [file for the payment](https://11thestate.com/cases/qualcomm-investor-settlement).



Anyways, do you think Qualcomm will finally make an offer to buy Intel? And has anyone here had $QCOM when this anti-competitive scandal happened? If so, how much were your losses?

2024-11-09,13:05:38,dividends,Navigating Investment Challenges Amidst a Wild Year for Certain Stocks (PFE MRK ALB for example),"Investing has become particularly challenging given the remarkable 1-year performance of companies such as IBM, AXON, UAL, IBKR, ORCL, DELL, GE, GEV GM GS and ISRG ‚Äì truly unprecedented. 

Meanwhile, other sectors or companies, like those in healthcare (XLV) or energy (XLE), have shown little to no growth. Notably, even some fundamentally strong value stocks like PEP, KO, DIS, and CMCSA have barely moved.

With that said, I've compiled a list of solid companies that I aim to establish positions in before year-end. Many of these companies are known for their consistent dividends.

You might ask, why not just buy SCHD or SPY? The answer is simple: I lack the intellectual and emotional capacity to invest in these indices when they're at all-time highs. It‚Äôs physically impossible for me. Therefore, I focus on selecting stocks that are oversold or undervalued, particularly in sectors that are experiencing speculative bubbles (such as banking and technology).

Some of you know that I often take profits quickly when a stock rises too fast, too strongly, and in an unusual manner (around +20% +30%) ‚Äì which I did recently with CSCO, TSLA, BMY MCD WFC and CVS (I'm kind of an active investor, a swing trader, haha.).

I will be keeping a close eye on PFE, SNY, NVS, ELV REGN ‚Äì COP SHEL, BA, NKE, INTC, UPS, MDLZ, PLD, DE, AMT, and BUD, for example. I mainly focus on the top 160 largest market caps traded on the U.S. market exchange.

From what I understand, nvdy will follow NVDA (before anyone asks, over half of my portfolio is straight NVDA, I know about the capped gains.) seeing as I‚Äôm bullish on NVDA and think they will continue to grow and go up (I‚Äôm thinking at least the next 3-5 years in the long long picture) would NVDY be a better option for the time being than jepq?

I've actually experienced it make round-trips between the mid 40s and high 50s on multiple occasions. This leads me to wonder is 25% near the peak yield a fund can maintain (absent the growth associated with the likes of Nvidia) while still staving off erosion?

I (21M) only recently have been getting into investing but have some questions that I have not found very good answers for (I am NOT going all in on TSLA);

I will be going on a LDS Mission sometime in the near future and will be unable to Access or manage my account for 2 years. How can I adjust my portfolio to have a better consistent growth/dividend growth while I am gone?

I will be adding a couple hundred each month until I leave, and some while I am gone. but other than that nothing will be adjusted (Other than a family member buying a mix of pre chosen ETFs with the cash put into the account. so I need to make some 'Short' term low 'risk' changes that will allow growth while being risk adverse. I am new to investing so I have no clue what would be the best course of action.

For my current situation I have 3 accounts. My main account, My Roth IRA, and my random Robinhood meme stocks. My main account does not allow recurring investments so I will be moving to robinhood for recurring investments.

I am not opposed to risk, but I don't want to let something tank my account while I am unable to manage it, so something of moderate risk should be fine but not all of it. Currently all I really know is that I need a good amount of diversity but also  because I am young I can be a bit more aggressive with my risk taking, which is what I have been currently doing.

Let me know your opinions!

To sum up my post:

Ill be gone for 2 years soon, and will have zero access to manage my account, someone will put the money I prepped, in at regular intervals and will most likely be able to buy some pre chosen ETFS in monthly occurrences, but It cannot be complicated (1 or 2 stocks in a 40/60 type split as the most complicated).

Until then how should I adjust my portfolio to adjust for zero management growth.

Any specific stock choices? or should I just follow a 70% ETF /30% Stock split theory.

Methodology: https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/docs/methodology_NQVDIV.pdf
 

The index applies the following company screen;
- Increased dividends year-on-year for at least 5 years (Note: DGRO accepts flat year-on-year dividends)
- 10 year average net income of > $0
- Forecasted dividend growth based on 10 years of data (dividend yield, ROE, ROIC, pre-tax income to debt ratio, 5-year dividend growth consistency, P/E, gross margin, 5-year net income stability, 5-year sales stability, 5-year ROE trend, cash to market cap ratio (?), 3-year monthly price volatility, FMC, consecutive years of dividend growth)
- Average 3-month volume of $5m
- Excludes REITs
 
All eligible are given a Dividend Yield (DY) score and 10-year Net Income Stability (NIS) score. 75 companies will be selected based on the following buckets of categories and based on their total DY and NIS scores.
- Mature bucket: 75% DY + 25% NIS | 50 securities with 20 years of dividend growth
- Established bucket: 50% DY + 50% NIS | 15 securities with 11 - 19 years of dividend growth
- Newcomer bucket: 25% DY + 75% NIS | 5 - 10 years of dividend growth
 
Weighting is capped at 4% and min of 0.25%
 
Dividend yield is 2.61%
 
Total returns;
- SCHD: 11.38%
- DGRO: 11.66%
- VSDA: 11.49%
 
Annualised year-on-year dividend growth (2018 - 2023);
- SCHD: 13.2%
- DGRO: 10.24%
- VSDA: 14.67%

But the good news now is that they agreed to pay $75M to investors to solve this huge mess. The deadline is in November, so if you got hit back then, you can [check here](https://11thestate.com/cases/qualcomm-investor-settlement) if you are eligible and file for the payment.

Background:  30 year old with just over 100k in a brokerage account. Approximately 70k in other retirement/tax advantaged accounts. The brokerage account as it sits right now is ~66% Nvidia with 25% in Divo, Jepi, and Pflt.  The remaining percentages are in some growth stocks.

I am toying with the idea of restructuring the portfolio so that it is more dividend heavy but I would obviously have to sell Nvidia to redistribute in any significant way.  The thing I'm having trouble with is my hesitance to let any of my Nvidia position go.  Nvidia position is 575 shares at ~$36 average cost(currently 115 per share).  It is my personal belief that 575 shares of Nvidia could be worth a very large amount of money in 5 to 10 years time.  

Maybe my doubt is coming from hitting the 30 year old milestone and I'm overthinking things but figured I'd ask for your opinions.

You should not buy all dividends when you are young, but you can view them as a way to capture and retain wealth easier in the event that you make solid gains in growth and would like to lock them in. For example if you make a bunch of money on a tech run up with TSLA for example, then you can trim positions and add to a safer dividend stock if you don‚Äôt want to deal with the volatility. At this point it becomes a game of which dividend stock feels the best to lock in some of those gains. 

I am 29 and have personally bought my largest holdings in DMLP and EPD over my working career so far. Due to looking for things when they sell off and believing in the dividends under the company I have achieved very high yield on cost with both of them. 

DMLP is yielding me 30-40% on initial investment, and has already paid me more back in dividends than my initial investment was. This was just a simple oil royalty play. 

EPD is yielding me around 12%, and is one of the largest energy dealers in the USA with tons of infrastructural pipelines that can‚Äôt be easily replaced. 

Both of these are pretty easy buy and holds for my entire life at this point and I don‚Äôt need to worry about extreme volatility (except for oil prices, which are sort of volatile at times as well). 

My current monthly Div payments are up to 1.5k and now covers my mortgage if I needed it to. I would be shooting myself in the foot if I had slept on these two massive Div payers when they were low price. Provides so much safety as well as double digit returns forever now as long as they don‚Äôt go out of business.  I don‚Äôt need any sort of special rally to make 10%+ and it is a very nice feeling of diversification. 

If you are young use both growth and dividends. Stop listening to people who argue all for 1 or the other. You can swing back and forth between when looking for varying levels of safety at times. ",TSLA,Tesla

2024-09-12,01:55:54,dividends,"NVDA up +7.42% today, NVDY up only +4.06%","NVDA stock had quite a rally today, gaining +7.42%

In contrast, the ETF NVDY that sells NVDA options gained only +4.06%. It gained, but less than NVDA. This is a perfect example of the problem with YieldMax funds.

Why is that? Well, because NVDY doesn't own any NVDA stock, only options that offset each other to create ""synthetic"" shares of stock, it doesn't participate in all of the gains when NVDA stock rallies. It's built into the design of NVDY and all YieldMax funds. The YieldMax fund managers state as much in the NVDY prospectus (which I suspect most YieldMax buyers don't bother reading):

**An Investment in the Fund is not an investment in NVDA**

* **The Fund‚Äôs strategy will cap its potential gains if NVDA shares increase in value.**
* **The Fund‚Äôs strategy is subject to all potential losses if NVDA shares decrease in value, which may not be offset by income received by the Fund.**
* The Fund does not invest directly in NVDA.
* Fund shareholders are not entitled to any NVDA dividends.

[https://www.yieldmaxetfs.com/nvdy/summary-prospectus](https://www.yieldmaxetfs.com/nvdy/summary-prospectus)

Well, OK I can hear people saying, but how about that juicy dividend that NVDY pays? That should surely compensate for the capped gains in share price, right?

Not exactly. While NVDY does pay a much larger dividend than NVDA, it can't offset the capped gains in share price compared to NVDA.

During the past month, NVDA shares gained +7.24%

(select 1 month time frame) [https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/NVDA](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/NVDA)

while NVDY shares **lost** -4.23%

(select 1 month time frame) [https://www.financecharts.com/etfs/NVDY](https://www.financecharts.com/etfs/NVDY)

NVDY paid a $1.3548 per share dividend on September 9 at a share price of $20.9632 which added 6.47% to the total return of NVDY during the past month, for a total return of (-4.23%) + 6.47% = +2.24%, compared to a total return of +7.24% for NVDA. The juicy dividend couldn't offset the lost gains in share price.

As the YieldMax fund managers warned:

* **The Fund‚Äôs strategy will cap its potential gains if NVDA shares increase in value.**
* **The Fund‚Äôs strategy is subject to all potential losses if NVDA shares decrease in value, which may not be offset by income received by the Fund.**

NVDY sacrifices gains for current income. The more NVDA stock has rallies like today, the farther and farther NVDY will fall behind NVDA, and the dividend can't compensate for the lost capped gains. You might make money with NVDY, but you will likely make more money with NVDA.

This can be seen if you compare the growth of $10,000 invested, with reinvested dividends, in NVDA and NVDY since May 2023 when NVDY was created. It includes periods when both NVDA and NVDY had rallies (rising prices) and corrections (falling prices).

* NVDY $25,099
* NVDA $37,842

I basically rotate the smaller weekly buys when an ex dividend is coming up for one of my holdings. I feel weird/pointless adding to a position when they just gave me a dividend unless it‚Äôs at a good buying price.

I rotate out, trying to snowball the dividends monthly and try to add to positions for the upcoming ex dividend date. Trying to build out the smaller paying months and add to the bigger ones. Yes, SCHD and VYM are my babies, and I know they have cross over but I feel with the SCHD rebalance they have different weights in different sectors. Making it so I‚Äôm exposed to a lot of areas. 

I think I‚Äôve done the math right and the 21 bucks a day adds roughly 30ish cents a year in dividend income.

I'm in Canada, so the ticker is going to be a bit different. Unfortunately, I don't have access to low fee etf options with out incurring some withholding taxes, but I tried to be as efficient as possible.  
  
Here's the portfolio:

[StockEvent doesnt work too well with margin so i use excel for full summary](https://preview.redd.it/i7sh5j6hkqkd1.jpg?width=863&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e4f8b55e1980d1fafd856bf480e99bf1be67ced)

The general strategy on this portfolio are broken down to 3 parts.  
  
1. Core Holding - This portfolio is mainly in a tax advantage account. This account will focus more on longer term outlook. All the distribution will be funnel in to a passive index such as VFV (SP500) or XQQ (Nasdaq). The distribution in an extreme emergency can be used for living expense. The plan here is that if imagine starting at 0 and invest the amount provided by this account for 30 years with 6% real return, the portfolio should be worth 1.5m and we can just live off that if all else fails.   
  
2. Margin Fixed income - This portfolio is in my margin account. I made a plunge in Q3 last year to purchased a lot of preferred shares at the peak (or what I thought was the peak) of interest rates. My assumption is that PS should move similar to bond and peak interest rates should somewhat indicate bottom of these PS prices. As interest decrease, or even just an market sentiment of rate decreasing should gradually move these shares price up. Also, as rate decrease, margin rate should also follow suit.  
  
As the distribution is more secured than common shares dividends, I felt a bit more comfortable going in with some margin. The distribution for this portfolio is mainly used for paying down margin, but can be used as a living expense if needed.  
  
Why Brookfield? I specifically picked up mostly BPO which is property side of Brookfield. This includes a lot of offices building related assets which I feel was priced down unreasonably at the time with market believing that WFH is here to stay. These PS at the time was trading at 40$ of issued price, yielding over 12-15% at the time. Majority of them are rate resets type.  
  
The margin should be paid down in around 4-5 years; however, as the rate bottomed out or the shares prices are close to issued price I may off load these to pay down margin and redistributed to equity based funds.  
  
3. Living Expense - This portfolio is mainly focused on broader market covered call etf mainly SP500 and Nasdaq with an exception of YTSL which only hold tesla. All the distribution from this portfolio is going toward living expense. Anything saved will be moved to emergency cash pile to later be reinvest or spend accordingly  
  
So imagine the whole portfolio distribution to be like your work income. 25% of the income (core) is going toward saving for the future, 25% (margin) going toward paying down debt which is margin, and 50% (living) is going toward living expense.  
  
---  
I also have 6-12 months emergency funds. In the case that market tanked hard, we will switch to living off these while reinvest the distribution. As economic uncertainty is looming and I'm just taking a plunge into this for the first time, the first few months we might be extra careful with spending and see where to go from then.  
  
Potential risk  
Aside from concentration risk in Brookfield, tesla and Nvdia that can add volatility. The other area of risk I can see is that I'm extracting 12% of distribution entirely from LE portfolio, this could proved shaky in the long term. My vision here is that in a year or 2 as rate decreases, I can off load preferred shares portion and move it to equity which will help pad the LE portfolio and bring down the spend rate on LE portfolio.   
  
The worst worst case scenario that I'm not fully prepared for would be the event where simultaneously, market crashed and Brookfield also get massive hit to the point where liquidation is in question where bonds and PS are priced down significantly - I then get margin called and liquidated.  
  
---  
  
Currently, me and my partner are burned out from our work. We have no other income sources, so we are living off this portfolio and plan to be for a long while. Generally we do not have lavish life style, so our projected expense should be covered by the LE portion of the portfolio. but if extra expense comes up we can drawdown the cash pile or from Margin portfolio. I've been a long time lurker in this sub and I thought I'd document my journey.

Here again- they have a picture and news that landed on nasdaq articles.    
  
*But you can't dig anywhere to see a direct statement from IBM.*    
  
So, it's probably fake, right?

Well, just prior to the announcement, they attended JAM IBM Hungary where Johann was invited as a speaker, and all the attendees from the photo were present.    
  
Do we think they were able to get a photo and then went on to create a major partner announcement plastered all over and IBM just looked the other way?    


And then we see that they became 1 of 20 members in the Linux Post Quantum Cryptography foundation.  1 of 20 members next to IBM, AWS, NVIDIA, META, GOOGLE  
  
The fun doesn't stop there- but those are the major ones.

Closed github?  Yes, to protect key IP.  But privatenet and public testnet are available to work with.  This will become open source as they launch mainnet and have first mover advantage with their ecosystem.

Hacked?  Yes, the token contract got hit (not the mainnet product).  They went through a lot of pain and fully restored everyone.  If they aren't legit, why not just spin up a new scam?  Clearly only a determined team with tech that has a future would have pushed through to where they are now.

Quantum threat is 10 years away?  The expectation to be prepared is less than 5.  Governments and business are upgrading cryptography, and regardless of when the threat arrives, the expectation will be there.  But, even without the quantum narrative, the team has a product that will reach untapped markets.  They just won't have the upgrade mess facing 99% of chains in these coming years.    
  
Team doesn't give a lot of updates on progress?  Yes, and they don't seem too concerned about feeding retail hype on a weekly basis.  A quiet confidence.

I've heard some investors look for friction- meaning what are the reasons they are potentially accumulating at a price not everyone else has already bought into.  Well, if that's you, there is more than enough friction here.  Cheers

2025-01-10,18:42:17,cryptocurrency,"The recent post about burning homes and self custody, has made me realize the incredible changes crypto is bringing. We suddenly have all these new options for our security, this new way to control our money, with choices.  It can be overwhelming to go from no choice to extensive choices","The post was full of comments about so many different options and different things you can do to secure your funds. Not just from a fire, but to secure your money in any way you want.

Growing up with traditional finance, like most people, I never had to worry about choices, because I didn't really have any. I handed my money to the bank, and handed over custody. It's now their way or the highway. It's not like I can pick how a bank should secure itself.

But it would be nice to have more options and adaptability.

Crypto opens up a world of options and adaptability.

You still have the option of going the traditional way with your crypto if you want, or the option of control.

There's not much limit in how creative you can get with your security once you have that full control. Basically, just about every type of security system in the world becomes available to you and becomes an option for your security. That's the power of integration of crypto. It's a purely mathematical system, where something as simple as a 24 word phrase can recover your funds.

I can have simple security, and boost practicality if I'm more interested in easy 24/7 access from my home. Or I can focus on security with worldwide access. Or I can focus on top notch level of security that would make a bank deposit box seem as unsafe as an unlocked Tesla parked in the middle of San Fransisco.

Once you have control of a tool that has this level of integration, has already top notch encryption, decentralization, and a worldwide secure network, then you have unprecedented power over your funds.

Blockchain and decentralization took out the key caveat that have always stood between our full control and security.

It's a system that puts the control back in your hands, which means that it's a system that's only limited by you.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-12-31,10:19:32,cryptocurrency,Trying to create a crypto wallet for india ,"Im a part of a startup , we are trying to create a crypto wallet thats as user friendly and useful as traditional digital wallets ( phone pe , pay tm , apple pay ) 

We want people that have bitcoin , etherium or other currencies to be able to directly pay to any vendor of their choice 
In the local currency . 
We would be facilitating this through our own block chain . 

The idea :- 

Create a blockchain which is tethered to the indian currency . Rupees would have to be deposited to acquire these coins . 
It builds our rupee reserves . 
Which means when people try to pay with the coins to regular vendors , 
The money from our actual reserves would be used to pay for it . 
It would enable safe and quick transactions , that would also mean the vendors dont require the same app .

Now the people whom who own bitcoin  etc can easily convert it to our blockchain currency as we will build the block chain with interoperability and use it that way or 

We have an option where they can choose to pay with bitcoin( since ours is a wallet , they can transfer bitcoin to our wallet ) , 

When they choose to pay with bitcoin , again rupees will be used from our reserves for the transfer accounting for the gas fees . 
We‚Äôll also recommend higher ammounts . 

The bitcoins will be transfered to our bitcoin reserve etc . 

My question to you all is :- 

A) will this be useful for people in india who hold cryptocurrency ? 

B) what are the drawbacks of this idea ? 

C) possible legal troubles or roadblocks from indian government 

D) development side issues , is interoperability with a new blockchain difficult ? If so why and what issues we might face ( we are trying to use the COSMOS SDK for this , it claims to have inbuilt interoperability in the framework ) 


Yes there are competitors and its a proven business  , https://zapit.io 
Zapit is a startup that made such seamless transactions possible .

2024-12-10,23:17:53,cryptocurrency,"Turns out Quantum Resistance was not a ""Crypto Narrative"".  It is an ALL systems issue.     What to know so this can be properly addressed and AVOID the panic.  ","Summary of the problem at hand.    
  
1. There is NOT an immediate risk. Your bags are safe, but changes are needed to keep it that way. 

2. The incoming risk is becoming more apparent- the timelines are highly debated.  The Google Willow news sparked concerns of how fast that might occur.  The timing is no longer worth debating- these advancements are going to continue to be published and people will demand safeguards.

3. Yes, it affects all systems, not just crypto.  Hence, not a crypto narrative.

4. This incoming risk moved slow, and it seemed it may never be a concern.  That has changed.

5. Thankfully, there has been extensive work to create cryptography that can withstand the capabilities of quantum computing.

6. No, this isn't a Super Computer that runs everything exponentially faster.  Instead, it is capable of running certain algorithms exponentially faster.  This is why Shor and potentially more advanced algos will be able to break today's encryption.

7. No, this is not about SHA-256.  It is about RSA and ECDSA.  These are the digital signatures that allow you to authorize transactions with your wallet or private key.  Updating these is not a simple fork, it won't be backward compatible, and may cause extensive downtime to transition.

8. Not all keys are exposed- generally it is any that had an outgoing transaction or the Satoshi era wallets that used a weaker form of encryption.

9. There is a lot of exposure which would be a problem. and the concern is that could escalate a massive sell-off.

10. The systems we think would be more likely targeted are already working on upgrading.  The ones that don't upgrade will become the targets.

11. There will be cloud capabilities, which would allow low level actors to break into wallets.  Crypto does not have any way to prove if they were the rightful owners, and of course we know people find ways to move the funds through mixers.  This makes it a very vulnerable target.

TLDR- there no longer are solid arguments for not working on a solution.  This is not doomsday, it requires thoughtful solutions, and making the tough choices to move forward.



Why this often appears to be a crypto narrative.

1. Quantum was developing slowly, and it wasn't clear this would ever become an issue.  So, it was dismissed as fud, and perhaps rightly so.

2. The misinformation around the issue at hand also gave people plenty of reasons to ignore it.  Most are addressed above, but I'm sure there will be more raised to debate.  But it becomes very hard to convince the masses that anon knows it isn't an issue when Google, NVIDIA, IBM, AWS, NIST, and all governments are talking about it.  Even Elon tweeted he is hearing it looks promising.

3. Saylor dismisses it at every opportunity using many of the above arguments.  Those no longer are going to satisfy people.  It will be far more effective to start talking about the ways we anticipate solving the issue, and acknowledging the challenges transparently.  Otherwise, it looks like the issue is being ignored or hidden.

4. The crypto projects that have worked hard on this obviously have community members that have been pushing this risk for a while.  Turns out they had valid arguments, but were seemingly premature until now.  As described above, this doesn't necessarily mean those projects win, and the others lose.    
  
5. It does mean well prepared projects won't have hard decisions to make, and can continue to focus on their use cases while others begin the extensive analysis and work required.  Certainly, that will create opportunities for growth as some projects will likely struggle to properly upgrade.",NVDA,NVIDIA

It's not really that bold. 

Despite the misinformation throughout the crypto space, the world is actively working on how to upgrade their cryptography. 

NIST approved new standards months ago, and had been working on them for many years

Upgrading to new cryptography will be required going forward and certainly Ethereum finally understands that.

The debate used to be how long can you hold off on addressing it. Obviously existing chains, systems, etc would rather be working on other things as the article points out. 

But now people are hearing about quantum everywhere.

Companies like NVIDIA, GOOGLE, AWS, IBM, MICROSOFT are all actively working on how to implement the new standards.

People pay attention to what they are working on. The Linux Post Quantum Cryptography Association includes all these companies.

And Nvidia even recently partnered with Google Quantum AI.

So, eth finally decided to stop fighting it and start working on it. 

But elsewhere talking heads are not grasping the reality.

They try to push it aside calling it a narrative designed to scare people into moving funds into coins with the proper protection.  

Obviously this is worldwide issue and not a crypto narrative. People want to be sure all their assets are safe, not just crypto. 

And as noted,  the cryptography exists, so why not start the work? I suspect we'll see more talk about how bitcoin is actively working on this as well... I hope.  There are a couple BIPS but the impacts are still concerning.

2024-11-30,07:57:06,cryptocurrency,What needs to happen for crypto to become mainstream and a currency used more frequent ,"Hear me out. This is not an Anti crypto or Bitcoin post. But this is a post regarding the complexity of bitcoin and storage for the average or novice crypto holder/trader. Will how Bitcoin is stored and or traded ever become easier so that the mainstream average person or older people can buy/trade/hold bitcoin. Now when you read this. You are coming from an advanced or better understanding of crypto than me or the average person. I have bought and or held crypto since 2016ish. I know little about cold wallets and I am just now setting up a trezor for my kids so that I can pass on btc to them for part of their inheritance. I believe like most of you that the value will increase. That's not the point of this discussion. What needs to happen or will happen so Bitcoin is more adaptable or usable for the average person. Ask any of your friends and I bet 50% or higher don't have a clue about what blockchain even is. Then ask them about cold storage for their crypto. If Bitcoin is going to become mainstream and become a larger token used for currency, it will have to become easier for the public to grasp and not get frustrated and give up trying to understand the complexity of what crypto/bitcoin is and how to store it safely so it can't be hacked.

You reading this and being familiar with how everything I have mentioned works, this might seem like a stretch. But if your grandparents or Joe blow is going to use crypto. It will have to become much easier to grasp and store it safely. Just setting up my wallet there is seed phrases, 12-24 word passwords, hidden wallets, default wallets, seed words I need to store and keep private to access my wallet and acct. not a chance 50% of the elderly can safely invest a decent part of their retirement in crypto and store it safely without a lot of help and at best they will be confused about the set up and not follow through. The more people involved in crypto, the quicker it becomes mainstream and prices grow even higher. Just a quick glance on the internet and billions of crypto is still being hacked and stolen each year. 

This is concerning to someone who is moving $6-7 figures in crypto to store in a wallet or cold storage. I lost $13k in 2020 or so by having random coins I had to sell then convert to this token from that token to cash out in cash. I sent coins from a wrong coin to another coin address and I was SOL. Lost that money and even hired a crypto attorney to see if they could recover my funds. Apparently once it went into that coin or wallet by my own doing and accident, There was no recovering them. 

Again that's not part of this discussion but the complexity of some trading could result is large losses. The average retiree won't be willing to put 1/3 or 1/2 their retirement into a coin or system that they will need training and help setting up a wallet to store their funds. My long winded post comes to the question. What can or will have to happen for btc to become mainstream enough the average or novice investor feels safe enough to be able to buy in and place part of their retirement in crypto. 


Setting up phrases then passworkd phrases to get in your trezor that can't be stored online for fear of hacking will scare your average investor. You reading this think this is foreign thinking because you have a basic or even advance understanding of crypto buying, sending and storing. Even now as I am setting up a tree safe 5, I am a little concerned about what I can do online in regards to being connected to the internet and what can and can't be hacked. So I store my words for my acct and trezor in a safe. How do you safely store your words and info in the case you pass away and need to transfer your assets to your kids. I don't think you want to store the words or passwords to your accts in your trust or will, people have access to that. I know there are stampings and metal plates you can store your passwords on but who and where do you trust to keep those. 

Your average 60-80 year old who is retired or close to retiring won't feel safe putting 6-7 figures in a system that is this complex to learn for a novice. I buy stocks , I pass away, my kids inherit my accts and they can keep or liquidate the stocks for liquid. I pass away and give them a cold storage wallet with the passwords and how to access the btc, that's a burden they now have to learn. Will crypto always be so complicated for those who don't spend time learning all the ins-outs of security. Buying Microsoft or Apple stock is simple enough. 

I can go to cashapp and buy stocks . I've been investing in stocks and various assets for 35 years, I've never been so worried about am I doing this and that right not to lose or have my btc hacked. Will the system ever become easy and mainstream enough that a lot of this fear is removed. I know debit cards are stolen and checking accts hacked, money moved. But your average person isn't near as worried about that as they are losing their crypto. I read between 6-17% of adults own crypto, that number needs to skyrocket to become mainstream. 

Look at the prices now, think of 50-60-80% of adults who own crypto, what that would do to the price. For crypto to become a mainstream form of currency. A lot of this fear and difficulty needs to be removed. Some of you reading this since you understand this will think this post is over the top. I assure you if you ask 50 people most of them have 2 concerns. How to buy and send and how to store it safely. Until that fear eases. Will crypto ever reach the price predictions some say if the average person can't buy, trade and store crypto without these worries. Again I own crypto. Will buy crypto, will store it to pass to my kids one day. But I feel the complexity of how to do this reamains one of the sticking points to what needs to become easier so the price reaches insane highs while removing the doubt of will I lose my crypto. 

Any thoughts if or how crypto becomes easier for the average Joe or retiree to buy and store becomes easier. Sorry for the long winded post but I hope you get the jist of the post.

Edit to post****+
Just to add to the complexity. I just ordered a tezor safe 5 and I had to cancel the order. I don't own a computer, only an iPhone and iPad. I trade 7 figures worth of stocks and options a week off an iPad but can't run a cold wallet from an iPad. This has to become easier and more mainstream . I can log in my bank acct with my iPad. Transfer or wire 6 figures to my investing acct. trade stocks. Sell stocks, wire the money back to my bank acct. buy bitcoin on cashapp and coinbase on my iPad but not use it for cold storage.

2024-10-17,21:36:23,cryptocurrency,Lost 1.6M from Fake Rabby Wallet in App Store,"At least 1.6M stolen from a wallet drainer in Apple's App Store - Cointelegraph reports! 

Yesterday Cointelegraph doxxed a Web3 hacker for his role in the fake Rabby\_IO Wallets that made it into the app store before the real one earlier this year.

Konstantin Pylinskiy aka konpyl, CEO of Moonward Capital, is the person held responsible according to the Cointelegraph article. 

This is the first instance I can recall of a major media company doxxing a hacker with a very detailed analysis of the theft!

The widely reported scam took place on Feb 16th 2024, but I'm showing based on victim reports it happened first on Dec 23rd 2023 and possibly as early as Oct 2023.

[A twitter post from a user scammed by the fake Rabby Wallet on Dec 23rd 2023](https://preview.redd.it/b8ln123lvcvd1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0623fc8bad39c0036eb100f7733d9b81feac4db)

I came across a few Support threads related to the fake Rabby wallets uploaded, one being here on Reddit, the other on a forum on Apple's own website.

Additionally, when the hack initially happened, most Media outlets reported the theft in the mid six figures. 

The article by Cointelegraph mentions the amount at over 1.6 MILLION lost. A full accounting is needed to get the true number.

# How the Fake Rabby Wallet Scam Happened

To get past Apple's strict review process with a wallet drainer not once, but at least twice, maybe even three times is quite the feat! If one of the most secure and trusted companies around can get scammed multiple time, no one is safe in web3!

The prevailing theory is the malicious developer of the fake Rabby Wallet applied to the iOS App Store under some generic fintech name. The app itself would appear innocent enough to the reviewer. 

Once the app was approved, the developer was able to change the name to ""Rabby Wallet & Crypto Solution"" while inserting malicious code to turn that innocent little financial app into a vicious crypto drainer.

When DeBank announced the launch of the real Rabby Wallet in the app store, the fake Rabby Wallet was already live while the real Rabby Wallet was still in Apple's approval process.

The accused bad actor, ""konpyl"", was able to drain numerous unsuspecting victims who thought they were engaging with the real Rabby Wallet, but instead got a fake one that targeted their crypto assets.

# Tracing the Funds

[Tracing the funds mentioned in the Cointelegraph article between 0x4E9395cc1075b57016BF8b5bF8782BFEF94c71C2 \(left image\) and 0x44BdB19dB1Cd29D546597AF7dc0549e7f6F9E480 \(right image\). ](https://preview.redd.it/h14ljc1c6dvd1.png?width=2756&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac8f20103059331d50ed35c0b6fa9264180608ae)

The flow of funds from the article can be extremely difficult to follow along at home but I'll do my best! A more detailed post about all of the wallets mentioned would make for a very lengthy analysis.

The research does look pretty spot on. The main connection I see to ""konpyl"" is that wallet with his former Opensea username - 0x44BdB19dB1Cd29D546597AF7dc0549e7f6F9E480 and the Rhinofi output wallet of 0x4E9395cc1075b57016BF8b5bF8782BFEF94c71C2 mentioned in the article.

I counted 6 txns worth almost 100k and found some shared deposit address activity between the two wallets as well.

It's nearly impossible to get a true number of the total amount lost in the scam and wallets involved without a detailed analysis of the theft dates. 1.6M lost could be a conservative number and the total victim account could be much higher. 

# Apple's Role in the Theft

It's wild to think malicious web3 applications can consistently make it into Apple's App Store. Traditionally, Apple has had a ""hands off"" approach when it comes to these things.

The Cointelegraph article mentions Google's approach, which appears to put in some effort to stop bad actors by publicity going after individuals who abuse Google Play.

I do think Apple has an obligation to protect users from any and all threats that appear in the App store.

Also due to the public nature of this theft, I'm hopeful for some recovery for some of the victims!

2024-09-29,16:13:12,cryptocurrency,"""I think today the message needs to be: yes, unequivocally, worry about this now. Have a plan.""","A recent Scott Aaronson blog sums up why major businesses and governments are updating cryptography ASAP.

It also addresses the variety of outdated arguments pessimists are stuck on.

(You can google scottaaronson blog 8329 as I can't seem to share the link here- I'll paste it below as well)

His quote:

""I‚Äôm so used to delivering a message of, maybe, eventually, someone will need to start thinking about migrating from RSA and Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve crypto to lattice-based crypto, or other systems that could plausibly withstand quantum attack. I think today that message needs to change. I think today the message needs to be: yes, unequivocally, worry about this now. Have a plan.""

I've also thought it is time for the existing coins to start designing and planning, at a minimum. It's plainly obvious major companies like Apple and Google are already implementing changes, so crypto should be at the forefront of this new era.  
  
This will require major work and there will be impacts and tradeoffs that require consensus.

This is probably why there is such resistance to acknowledging this. I fear we will be left with rushed solutions creating unnecessary disruption, or worse.

Vitalik at least considered an emergency plan. But we should be demanding building/ testing of viable solutions ahead of an emergency.

It will be a full rewrite of how we digitally sign our transactions- not backward compatible- and likely require users to take actions such as transferring to wallets that are signing with the new cryptography.

If you are looking beyond the next 6 months for your portfolio, you'll need to start considering the impacts and which projects are genuinely prepared, not just claims it will be easy to add in.

Quantum Computing: Between Hope and Hype

So, back in June the White House announced that UCLA would host a binational US/India workshop, for national security officials from both countries to learn about the current status of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography. It fell to my friend and colleague Rafail Ostrovsky to organize the workshop, which ended up being held last week. When Rafi invited me to give the opening talk, I knew he‚Äôd keep emailing until I said yes. So, on the 3-hour flight to LAX, I wrote the following talk in a spiral notebook, which I then delivered the next morning with no slides. I called it ‚ÄúQuantum Computing: Between Hope and Hype.‚Äù I thought Shtetl-Optimized readers might be interested too, since it contains my reflections on a quarter-century in quantum computing, and prognostications on what I expect soon. Enjoy, and let me know what you think!



Quantum Computing: Between Hope and Hype

by Scott Aaronson

September 16, 2024



When Rafi invited me to open this event, it sounded like he wanted big-picture pontification more than technical results, which is just as well, since I‚Äôm getting old for the latter. Also, I‚Äôm just now getting back into quantum computing after a two-year leave at OpenAI to think about the theoretical foundations of AI safety. Luckily for me, that was a relaxing experience, since not much happened in AI these past two years. \[Pause for laughs\] So then, did anything happen in quantum computing while I was away?



This, of course, has been an extraordinary time for both quantum computing and AI, and not only because the two fields were mentioned for the first time in an American presidential debate (along with, I think, the problem of immigrants eating pets). But it‚Äôs extraordinary for quantum computing and for AI in very different ways. In AI, practice is wildly ahead of theory, and there‚Äôs a race for scientific understanding to catch up to where we‚Äôve gotten via the pure scaling of neural nets and the compute and data used to train them. In quantum computing, it‚Äôs just the opposite: there‚Äôs right now a race for practice to catch up to where theory has been since the mid-1990s.



I started in quantum computing around 1998, which is not quite as long as some people here, but which does cover most of the time since Shor‚Äôs algorithm and the rest were discovered. So I can say: this past year or two is the first time I‚Äôve felt like the race to build a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer is actually underway. Like people are no longer merely giving talks about the race or warming up for the race, but running the race.



Within just the last few weeks, we saw the group at Google announce that they‚Äôd used the Kitaev surface code, with distance 7, to encode one logical qubit using 100 or so physical qubits, in superconducting architecture. They got a net gain: their logical qubit stays alive for maybe twice as long as the underlying physical qubits do. And crucially, they find that their logical coherence time increases as they pass to larger codes, with higher distance, on more physical qubits. With superconducting, there are still limits to how many physical qubits you can stuff onto a chip, and eventually you‚Äôll need communication of qubits between chips, which has yet to be demonstrated. But if you could scale Google‚Äôs current experiment even to 1500 physical qubits, you‚Äôd probably be below the threshold where you could use that as a building block for a future scalable fault-tolerant device.



Then, just last week, a collaboration between Microsoft and Quantinuum announced that, in the trapped-ion architecture, they applied pretty substantial circuits to logically-encoded qubits‚Äî-again in a way that gets a net gain in fidelity over not doing error-correction, modulo a debate about whether they‚Äôre relying too much on postselection. So, they made a GHZ state, which is basically like a Schr√∂dinger cat, out of 12 logically encoded qubits. They also did a ‚Äúquantum chemistry simulation,‚Äù which had only two logical qubits, but which required three logical non-Clifford gates‚Äîwhich is the hard kind of gate when you‚Äôre doing error-correction.



Because of these advances, as well as others‚Äîwhat QuEra is doing with neutral atoms, what PsiQuantum and Xanadu are doing with photonics, etc.‚ÄîI‚Äôm now more optimistic than I‚Äôve ever been that, if things continue at the current rate, either there are useful fault-tolerant QCs in the next decade, or else something surprising happens to stop that. Plausibly we‚Äôll get there not just with one hardware architecture, but with multiple ones, much like the Manhattan Project got a uranium bomb and a plutonium bomb around the same time, so the question will become which one is most economic.



If someone asks me why I‚Äôm now so optimistic, the core of the argument is 2-qubit gate fidelities. We‚Äôve known for years that, at least on paper, quantum fault-tolerance becomes a net win (that is, you sustainably correct errors faster than you introduce new ones) once you have physical 2-qubit gates that are \~99.99% reliable. The problem has ‚Äúmerely‚Äù been how far we were from that. When I entered the field, in the late 1990s, it would‚Äôve been like a Science or Nature paper to do a 2-qubit gate with 50% fidelity. But then at some point the 50% became 90%, became 95%, became 99%, and within the past year, multiple groups have reported 99.9%. So, if you just plot the log of the infidelity as a function of year and stare at it‚Äîyeah, you‚Äôd feel pretty optimistic about the next decade too!



Or pessimistic, as the case may be! To any of you who are worried about post-quantum cryptography‚Äîby now I‚Äôm so used to delivering a message of, maybe, eventually, someone will need to start thinking about migrating from RSA and Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve crypto to lattice-based crypto, or other systems that could plausibly withstand quantum attack. I think today that message needs to change. I think today the message needs to be: yes, unequivocally, worry about this now. Have a plan.



So, I think this moment is a good one for reflection. We‚Äôre used to quantum computing having this air of unreality about it. Like sure, we go to conferences, we prove theorems about these complexity classes like BQP and QMA, the experimenters do little toy demos that don‚Äôt scale. But if this will ever be practical at all, then for all we know, not for another 200 years. It feels really different to think of this as something plausibly imminent. So what I want to do for the rest of this talk is to step back and ask, what are the main reasons why people regarded this as not entirely real? And what can we say about those reasons in light of where we are today?



Reason #1



For the general public, maybe the overriding reason not to take QC seriously has just been that it sounded too good to be true. Like, great, you‚Äôll have this magic machine that‚Äôs gonna exponentially speed up every problem in optimization and machine learning and finance by trying out every possible solution simultaneously, in different parallel universes. Does it also dice peppers?



For this objection, I‚Äôd say that our response hasn‚Äôt changed at all in 30 years, and it‚Äôs simply, ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs not what it will do and not how it will work.‚Äù We should acknowledge that laypeople and journalists and unfortunately even some investors and government officials have been misled by the people whose job it was to explain this stuff to them.



I think it‚Äôs important to tell people that the only hope of getting a speedup from a QC is to exploit the way that QM works differently from classical probability theory ‚Äî in particular, that it involves these numbers called amplitudes, which can be positive, negative, or even complex. With every quantum algorithm, what you‚Äôre trying to do is choreograph a pattern of interference where for each wrong answer, the contributions to its amplitude cancel each other out, whereas the contributions to the amplitude of the right answer reinforce each other. The trouble is, it‚Äôs only for a few practical problems that we know how to do that in a way that vastly outperforms the best known classical algorithms.



What are those problems? Here, for all the theoretical progress that‚Äôs been made in these past decades, I‚Äôm going to give the same answer in 2024 that I would‚Äôve given in 1998. Namely, there‚Äôs the simulation of chemistry, materials, nuclear physics, or anything else where many-body quantum effects matter. This was Feynman‚Äôs original application from 1981, but probably still the most important one commercially. It could plausibly help with batteries, drugs, solar cells, high-temperature superconductors, all kinds of other things, maybe even in the next few years.



And then there‚Äôs breaking public-key cryptography, which is not commercially important, but is important for other reasons well-known to everyone here.



And then there‚Äôs everything else. For problems in optimization, machine learning, finance, and so on, there‚Äôs typically a Grover‚Äôs speedup, but that of course is ‚Äúonly‚Äù a square root and not an exponential, which means that it will take much longer before it‚Äôs relevant in practice. And one of the earliest things we learned in quantum computing theory is that there‚Äôs no ‚Äúblack-box‚Äù way to beat the Grover speedup. By the way, that‚Äôs also relevant to breaking cryptography ‚Äî other than the subset of cryptography that‚Äôs based on abelian groups and can be broken by Shor‚Äôs algorithm or the like. The centerpiece of my PhD thesis, twenty years ago, was the theorem that you can‚Äôt get more than a Grover-type polynomial speedup for the black-box problem of finding collisions in cryptographic hash functions.



So then what remains? Well, there are all sorts heuristic quantum algorithms for classical optimization and machine learning problems ‚Äî QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm), quantum annealing, and so on ‚Äî and we can hope that sometimes they‚Äôll beat the best classical heuristics for the same problems, but it will be trench warfare, not just magically speeding up everything. There are lots of quantum algorithms somehow inspired by the HHL (Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd) algorithm for solving linear systems, and we can hope that some of those algorithms will get exponential speedups for end-to-end problems that matter, as opposed to problems of transforming one quantum state to another quantum state. We can of course hope that new quantum algorithms will be discovered. And most of all, we can look for entirely new problem domains, where people hadn‚Äôt even considered using quantum computers before‚Äînew orchards in which to pick low-hanging fruit. Recently, Shih-Han Hung and I, along with others, have proposed using current QCs to generate cryptographically certified random numbers, which could be used in post-state cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. I‚Äôm hopeful that people will find other protocol applications of QC like that one ‚Äî ‚Äúproof of quantum work.‚Äù \[Another major potential protocol application, which Dan Boneh brought up after my talk, is quantum one-shot signatures.\]



Anyway, taken together, I don‚Äôt think any of this is too good to be true. I think it‚Äôs genuinely good and probably true!



Reason #2



A second reason people didn‚Äôt take seriously that QC was actually going to happen was the general thesis of technological stagnation, at least in the physical world. You know, maybe in the 40s and 50s, humans built entirely new types of machines, but nowadays what do we do? We issue press releases. We make promises. We argue on social media.



Nowadays, of course, pessimism about technological progress seems hard to square with the revolution that‚Äôs happening in AI, another field that spent decades being ridiculed for unfulfilled promises and that‚Äôs now fulfilling the promises. I‚Äôd also speculate that, to the extent there is technological stagnation, most of it is simply that it‚Äôs become really hard to build new infrastructure‚Äîhigh-speed rail, nuclear power plants, futuristic cities‚Äîfor legal reasons and NIMBY reasons and environmental review reasons and Baumol‚Äôs cost disease reasons. But none of that really applies to QC, just like it hasn‚Äôt applied so far to AI.



Reason #3



A third reason people didn‚Äôt take this seriously was the sense of ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been 20 years already, where‚Äôs my quantum computer?‚Äù QC is often compared to fusion power, another technology that‚Äôs ‚Äúeternally just over the horizon.‚Äù (Except, I‚Äôm no expert, but there seems to be dramatic progress these days in fusion power too!)



My response to the people who make that complaint was always, like, how much do you know about the history of technology? It took more than a century for heavier-than-air flight to go from correct statements of the basic principle to reality. Universal programmable classical computers surely seemed more fantastical from the standpoint of 1920 than quantum computers seem today, but then a few decades later they were built. Today, AI provides a particularly dramatic example where ideas were proposed a long time ago‚Äîneural nets, backpropagation‚Äîthose ideas were then written off as failures, but no, we now know that the ideas were perfectly sound; it just took a few decades for the scaling of hardware to catch up to the ideas. That‚Äôs why this objection never had much purchase by me, even before the dramatic advances in experimental quantum error-correction of the last year or two.



Reason #4



A fourth reason why people didn‚Äôt take QC seriously is that, a century after the discovery of QM, some people still harbor doubts about quantum mechanics itself. Either they explicitly doubt it, like Leonid Levin, Roger Penrose, or Gerard ‚Äòt Hooft. Or they say things like, ‚Äúcomplex Hilbert space in 2n dimensions is a nice mathematical formalism, but mathematical formalism is not reality‚Äù‚Äîthe kind of thing you say when you want to doubt, but not take full intellectual responsibility for your doubts.



I think the only thing for us to say in response, as quantum computing researchers‚Äîand the thing I consistently have said‚Äîis man, we welcome that confrontation! Let‚Äôs test quantum mechanics in this new regime. And if, instead of building a QC, we have to settle for ‚Äúmerely‚Äù overthrowing quantum mechanics and opening up a new era in physics‚Äîwell then, I guess we‚Äôll have to find some way to live with that.



Reason #5



My final reason why people didn‚Äôt take QC seriously is the only technical one I‚Äôll discuss here. Namely, maybe quantum mechanics is fine but fault-tolerant quantum computing is fundamentally ‚Äúscreened off‚Äù or ‚Äúcensored‚Äù by decoherence or noise‚Äîand maybe the theory of quantum fault-tolerance, which seemed to indicate the opposite, makes unjustified assumptions. This has been the position of Gil Kalai, for example.



The challenge for that position has always been to articulate, what is true about the world instead? Can every realistic quantum system be simulated efficiently by a classical computer? If so, how? What is a model of correlated noise that kills QC without also killing scalable classical computing?‚Äîwhich turns out to be a hard problem.



In any case, I think this position has been dealt a severe blow by the Random Circuit Sampling quantum supremacy experiments of the past five years. Scientifically, the most important thing we‚Äôve learned from these experiments is that the fidelity seems to decay exponentially with the number of qubits, but ‚Äúonly‚Äù exponentially ‚Äî as it would if the errors were independent from one gate to the next, precisely as the theory of quantum fault-tolerance assumes. So for anyone who believes this objection, I‚Äôd say that the ball is now firmly in their court.



So, if we accept that QC is on the threshold of becoming real, what are the next steps? There are the obvious ones: push forward with building better hardware and using it to demonstrate logical qubits and fault-tolerant operations on them. Continue developing better error-correction methods. Continue looking for new quantum algorithms and new problems for those algorithms to solve.



But there‚Äôs also a less obvious decision right now. Namely, do we put everything into fault-tolerant qubits, or do we continue trying to demonstrate quantum advantage in the NISQ (pre-fault-tolerant) era? There‚Äôs a case to be made that fault-tolerance will ultimately be needed for scaling, and anything you do without fault-tolerance is some variety of non-scalable circus trick, so we might as well get over the hump now.



But I‚Äôd like to advocate putting at least some thought into how to demonstrate a quantum advantage in the near-term. Thay could be via cryptographic protocols, like those that Kahanamoku-Meyer et al. have proposed. It could be via pseudorandom peaked quantum circuits, a recent proposal by me and Yuxuan Zhang‚Äîif we can figure out an efficient way to generate the circuits. Or we could try to demonstrate what William Kretschmer, Harry Buhrman, and I have called ‚Äúquantum information supremacy,‚Äù where, instead of computational advantage, you try to do an experiment that directly shows the vastness of Hilbert space, via exponential advantages for quantum communication complexity, for example. I‚Äôm optimistic that that might be doable in the very near future, and have been working with Quantinuum to try to do it.



On the one hand, when I started in quantum computing 25 years ago, I reconciled myself to the prospect that I‚Äôm going to study what fundamental physics implies about the limits of computation, and maybe I‚Äôll never live to see any of it experimentally tested, and that‚Äôs fine. On the other hand, once you tell me that there is a serious prospect of testing it soon, then I become kind of impatient. Some part of me says, let‚Äôs do this!

Example:

You have a tree, it can only make 100 apples. Someone buys 1 apple from you for $1 and just like that suddenly the marketcap of all apples your tree made is $100. Did someone give you this $100? No. Marketcap is an imaginary metric, not the number of dollars someone handed you.",AAPL,Apple

Devin Finzer (dfinzer.eth)

@dfinzer
OpenSea has received a Wells notice from the SEC threatening to sue us because they believe NFTs on our platform are securities.

We're shocked the SEC would make such a sweeping move against creators and artists. But we're ready to stand up and fight.

Cryptocurrencies have long been in the crosshairs of the SEC, and companies like 
@coinbase
, 
@Uniswap
, 
@RobinhoodApp
, 
@krakenfx
, and 
@Consensys
 have been fighting against the SEC's single-track  approach of ""regulation by enforcement.""

But this is a move into uncharted territory. By targeting NFTs, the SEC would stifle innovation on an even broader scale: hundreds of thousands of online artists and creatives are at risk, and many do not have the resources to defend themselves.

NFTs are fundamentally creative goods: art, collectibles, video game items, domain names, event tickets, and more.

We should not regulate digital art in the same way we regulate collateralized debt obligations.

As we've built OpenSea, we've heard so many stories about the impact of NFTs on people‚Äôs lives, including:

‚Ä¢ Student artists finding full-time careers in selling their digital art
‚Ä¢ Indie game developers instantly enabling open markets for their in-game items, without having to build marketplaces from scratch
‚Ä¢ Passionate collectors from different corners of the world joining new communities, all centered around shared digital ownership

It would be a terrible outcome if creators stopped making digital art because of regulatory saber-rattling. Take, for example, the suit filed against the SEC by the musician 
@songadaymann
 and conceptual artist 
@brianlfrye
, which describes their fear that the sale of their art and music could be deemed unregistered securities offerings.

In addition to standing our own ground, we're pledging $5M to help cover legal fees for NFT creators and devs that receive a Wells notice. Every creator, big or small, should be able to innovate without fear.

I hope the SEC will come to its senses sooner rather than later, and that they'll listen with an open mind.

Until then, we'll stand up and fight for our industry.

It makes you wonder if the hype around cryptocurrencies is really justified. Despite all the talk about Bitcoin and other crypto coins being the future, the reality seems quite different when you look at the numbers. Traditional investments still dominate the wealth landscape. Maybe it's time to switch and consider investing in something more stable like nvidia stocks haha.

Seing how nvidia has been consistently performing well, especially with the growth in gaming and tech industries. Their technology is in high demand, and their stock has been on a steady rise. It seems like a more reliable path to wealth compared to the volatile and unpredictable crypto market.  Maybe slow and steady is better than a higher risk? So, if you're looking to grow your investments, it might be wise to look into companies with strong fundamentals and a proven track record of success, rather than betting on the next big cryptocurrency trend.

2024-07-26,15:32:14,cryptocurrency,Preparing for Q-Day as NIST nears approval of PQC standards - Help Net Security,"The post-quantum cryptography conversation continues to heat up.

Coins like QANX, QRL, CELL, XX, XEP all ran quite a bit stronger than other alts, but mostly fell right back when alts retreated.

Despite this topic often times creating frustrations for people who want to say it will not be an issue for a long time, you can see there will be plenty of press.  And since real world companies are investing and upgrading, I believe people will gravitate toward agreeing  systems and crypto/blockchain need to adopt the new standards.

If you don't implement a solution, at best, you will be considered vulnerable.  At worst, you will suffer attacks.  Either way, people will expect the changes.

This is not a quick fix- it requires thoughtful solutions.  The algos are understood, retrofitting these into existing ecosystems is the hard part.  And trying to find ways to limit impacts to users.  It's for that reason I believe legacy coins need to be one of the first to start building.  And before they can do that, they need to gain some consensus.  And after making a major change, and testing it like crazy to protect all funds, they need to give users time to take the necessary migration steps.

Assuming they start now, and they should, I expect this will draw even more attention to the projects that recognized this problem needed to be solved.  The ones listed have thought about this for years.  In my opinion, each still has to prove how they will gain adoption. 

Being quantum resistant alone does not create adoption.  As outlined in the article, every system will need to become quantum resistant.  Some will simply fail at this, some won't work well, and some will run great, providing capabilities the world needs.  

I believe those will emerge as the next winners.  How do you see it playing out?",AAPL,Apple

Since then, these projects really cooled off.

People like to categorize coins into certain narratives, and Quantum will continue to grow in awareness. 

But for most of these projects, planning for quantum resistance is just one of the features.  

$QRL was one of the first to really focus on building a quantum resistant chain and continues to seek adoption.

$QANX reached .10 before falling all the way back to .037.  News of EU country using their tech, and Ethereum board member Patrick Storchenegger being CEO of Qanplatfrom IP holding company drove the run-up.  Also anticipation of testnet recently delivered.

Just the technical writeup: https://gist.github.com/kayabaNerve/b754e9ed9fa4cc2c607f38a83aa3df2a

Proof following challenge: https://twitter.com/techleaks24/status/1791512329722442045

Copy of the full technical writeup:

### The Dero Protocol

The protocol uses a pair of rings, one for the senders, one for the receivers, represented as a singular ring. With each transfer, a list of ElGamal ciphertexts is provided for all accounts within the joint ring. This ElGamal ciphertext is formed as `r * G, (r * K) + (a * G)`, where `r` is some randomness, `K` is the key for the account the ciphertext is for, and `a` is the amount.

### The Dero Wallet Protocol

Dero offers an 'encrypted message' with every transaction. Even if the user does not explicitly provide one, a message will exist (either with internally provided values or left empty). For the only defined type of message, the message is encoded as the index of the sender, a CBOR-encoded object, and zero-padding. The message is encrypted with the Chacha20 stream created by a key of `H(H(r * K) || K)` where `r` is some randomness and `K` is the key for the account the ciphertext is for.

### The Issue

Dero reuses the randomness for the ElGamal ciphertexts and the message encryption. This means, if the amount is 0, the second part of the ElGamal ciphertext is the shared key and the message can be decrypted (also revealing the receiver, as the ElGamal ciphertext used is for a specific receiver). If the amount isn't 0, one can subtract `1 * G` until the amount term has a 0 coefficient. When the message does decrypt, the amount of subtractions performed is the amount, breaking amount privacy.

Since the first byte of the message is the sender index, this also reveals the sender. In total, this compromises sender, amount, receiver, and message privacy.

### Technical Notes

Since the encryption isn't authenticated (as far as the author of this work can tell), we cannot explicitly know if a decryption is valid or invalid. Practically, we can. The last 16 bytes of the message will be zeroes, with very high statistical probability, if the message doesn't fill those bytes and the decryption key is correct. A random decryption key should produce random noise there instead.

If the message does fill those bytes, then it's a long stream of CBOR for which it's unlikely to be valid once further bounds are added. Dero encodes all keys with an additional byte for the type (forcing said byte to be one of a few options and the corresponding value to be of that type). While not a strict limitation, all pre-defined keys are one letter, potentialy practically offering the bound of keys being two-byte ASCII (though that assumes no callers defined their own keys which are either non-ASCII or longer than one letter). With only the certain additional bounds, a CBOR object which takes up the entire space will match random noise approximately once out of every 2\*\*40 trials. It'd be sane to flag CBOR objects which look incorrect (despite passing the trial), and if so, continue brute forcing (the sanest result being the likely one with drastically increasing probability as it appears saner, any result shorter than 129 bytes being effectively certain).

In summary, the trial decryption algorithm is checking if the result is a valid sender index (less than the ring length, for one of the potential senders), checking there's a valid CBOR object _with the certain additional bounds_, and finally checking the remaining bytes are all zeroes. Distinctly, since there's a lack of authentication (other than setting the sender ring length to 1, its own issue in this context), it's presumed possible for a transaction's sender to claim to be someone else (impersonating them). This is a distinct vulnerability in the messaging protocol, at least as it's being advertised for usage (in place of existing encrypted messengers).

The byte intended for the sender index was historically mistakenly used for the receiver index. This was only patched six months ago in https://github.com/deroproject/derohe/pull/147. Accordingly, sender privacy specifically was only broken for transactions made with wallet software updated to include the patch.

The amount does need to be brute forced. Dero amounts take 41 bits (due to only using 5 decimals and a supply in the low tens of millions), and with the maximum joint ring size of 128 (leaving 64 receivers, or 2\*\*6 candidates), takes 47 bits of effort at most (which is quite feasible for computers). Due to most transactions having smaller than larger amounts, most transactions can be cracked faster than the max time brute force, and statistical analysis could be used to prioritize certain receivers (reducing the average time for any algorithm which is even slightly more right than wrong).

Because this is an attack on the wallet protocol, it can decrypt any message (as the message is part of the wallet protocol). The recovery of the amount, receiver, and sender assume the transaction was made in accordance with the Dero wallet protocol. Theoretically, someone could have their own non-compliant Dero wallet, which either could not have its privacy broken or could provide false readings (depending on if it was programmed to use distinct encryption keys in explicit preparation for a work such as this, making this vulnerability prior discovered). While no such wallets are known to the author of this to work, and are extremely unlikely to exist, that must be noted.

### Disclosure Timeline

This issue was found on May 14th, with a proof of concept built the same day. The proof of concept will be released in a week (leaving those affected a bit of time to prepare, though this post is detailed enough to enable independent development of such tools in practice). It isn't optimized to the degree necessary to crack every single transaction on the network now (as it'd need to be rebuilt for GPUs, or potentially ideally FPGAs) yet suffices as a proof of concept.

Dero offers a 50,000 USD bug bounty for vulnerabilities which affect the financial integrity of the blockchain. It includes no details on how to disclose bugs however. The author anonymously reached out to the maintainer of the Dero Project (""Captain Dero"") over Matrix to inquire if the bug bounty would still apply and to report their findings. Due to:

1) Not receiving a reply from the maintainer within two days (a fair time to have the initial message acknowledged, per the author's opinion and the opinion of a leading Web3 security platform)
2) Contacting a developer successfully who said ""Whatever you're looking at is likely a misunderstanding on your part"" (with no context other than there being a critical privacy issue attempting to be disclosed), who then said to submit a PR with my ""proposal"" (despite it being a security disclosure?), and when emphasized the desire to privately disclose to the maintainer before going public, being told the options were to go public or simply wait until the maintainer gets around to it. When following up a day later to again attempt to cause a successful connection with the maintainer, noting the lack thereof thus far, ""Then just disclose it, no need to harass me over it""
3) Deciding users should be made aware as soon as possible so they no longer expect privacy for what would inevitably not have privacy

The author decided to publish this without achieving successful communication with the maintainer. While that does make these findings unconfirmed by the Dero project, the proof of concept establishes the theory works.

### Moving Forward

If such a vulnerability was found in Signal, the author of this work would not be able to decrypt all sent messages on the network as they would not have access. By placing messages on a highly replicated ledger, it's trivial for any adversary to obtain the ciphertexts of any message ever sent. This means a wallet compromised years after use can still have all its messages read, and since Dero doesn't use a post-quantum key exchange, any adversary with a discrete log oracle (such as one with a quantum computer) would eventually be able to decrypt all messages. Highly replicated ledgers should not be used for storage of extremely sensitive information in general, even if encrypted. If such a ledger is used regardless, it should be in a forward-secret manner with only a bounded subset of messages being readable on compromise.

The immediate fix for this specific issue is to use distinct randomness for the message encryption key. That alone does not fix the variety of issues with this design (when posited as a secure messaging protocol). For context on the difficulty of secure messaging protocols, please see https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/376 (a 94-page analysis of Signal), Signal's post-quantum protocol https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/, the SimpleX documentation and specifications https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/blob/stable/protocol/overview-tjr.md (which argues themselves a notable improvement upon Signal), and iMessage's extensive work on Contact Key Verification https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-contact-key-verification. This is an extensive field of theory for a reason.

The Dero (wallet) protocol has largely been undocumented and without peer review. Its proofs for a transfer use a Bulletproofs inner-product at the end, yet the higher-level constructions aren't documented other than one or two incredibly vague comments, such as how they're forming 'one-out-of-many' proofs (which are an explicit thing and it's not contested that the intent of these proofs is to implement one. The question is which it intends to implement). Hopefully, the Dero developers start formalizing their protocol and develop better relations with the wider cryptographic community as to cause peer review and help prevent issues such as this in the future.

To the members of the Dero community, and people in general, the recommendation is to only use secure messengers which have a peer-reviewed protocol and FOSS clients, such as Signal (with Molly being the leading FOSS client). This same line of reasoning also applies to privacy protocols in general, including those which apply to financial transactions. For a private, verifiable protocol for financial transactions, please see Monero or Zcash Orchard (the latter achieves stronger privacy in theory yet has only been deployed on a network which doesn't require all transactions be private).

Finally, the Dero community frequently has very grandiose marketing which claims their technology the best. While it's understandable for fans of a project to believe their project is the best, every project has hard limits. With this effective full-loss of privacy (except for sender privacy on transactions made by wallet software older than ~6 months), may they hopefully acknowledge no one is perfect, and especially not Dero.",AAPL,Apple

Following up on this post, I'd like you guys to share some of your insights as to what you've seen going on on the crypto space, I'll start:

>GALA games, meant to create the steam of crypto, where game developers would create their games and sell their NFTs on their platform. They started off with one game TownStar which was a pretty chill game and made a lot of people believe at first.

>In the end Gala games was just spending money on marketing, partnerships with snoop dog and game companies,

>**In the end it just sold tons of NFTs to games that weren't even polished to start development and many devs stopped development if they ever intended to...**

>Render: a network to distribute GPU power to people who wanted to use, paying up in Render to those who provided and completed the task.

>In essence they have so little network usage and distributed only the computing power to a few people that most just ended up with their PCs online for nothing earning nothing.

>**Their marketing team seems to be on fire tho, Lots of CTs, VCs and the casual fake news about partnership with apple.**

>HEX (Richard Heart ) Dude was the whole marketing team, he selectively chose which success he had in life out of a thousand swings to sell how good he was at predicting the market. He had a good way of selling people stuff, because His followers were die hard for that token. In the end he was just selling his bags along the way.

>SHIB The token that was a meme then Defi then game, AI next? I think the insiders are trying to milk the token for a long time

2024-05-14,15:58:48,cryptocurrency,99% Crypto projects are all about marketing and money making,"People invested in crypto are only seeing through their hopes point of view, so let me tell you how is their point of view. If you don't know this and you're not in on it then you're the victim

Let me explain:

Most crypto projects have founders which mostly start the project sometimes with as little as just an idea.

They create the token which they explain it's purpose to exist called tokenomics.

Then the real work and strategy begins **MARKETING**

As long as you know the right people on CT or VC's you can have an easy time marketing your project. Nothing like a good old token distribution plan to compensate people shilling their token. Thus more insiders for the team which are now all interested in making the price of the token rise.

After the token distribution and prob some buying to make the price look like it's starting to rise, the shilling commences. Backed by **MARKETING**

People on twitter see Wizz & Kaduna etc shilling the token and they buy it.

After that people need to buy from easier places like exchanges.

Exchange pressure commences, followed by another token distribution to XYZ exchanges interested to get in on the action.

A bit more marketing and you starting to see Adds on twitter articles etc.

Now that there's nice liquidity on the exchanges, the real game commences.

# The dump

So now that your token is trending, and you get nice fat bags you start selling more getting those millions stacked. You continue with the marketing strategy for the liquidity required for the insiders to exit.

Pay a little more to CTs to pump up the hype articles talking about it, Price targets, ""supposed partnerships with Apple or Google"" whatnot.

Once the price starts to dump you reduce the marketing but still making the hopes up for the little fish invested in it. and you continue to sell as much as you can.

**If you see Kaduna & others still giving hopes up about his shill even tho the price is dumping he's probably not in on it, he was paid to give hopes not hold the token.**

# Now you're rich what now?

Now Here's tree options:

Revive the token with your liquidity and start the marketing engine again with the promisse of reaching ATH again.

Or You start a new project all over again but now you have more liquidity eaier time!

Or you go live life at it's fullest.

**There's a very little percentage of people who made tremendous amounts of money from these schemes and most of them were insiders who knew the game not regular degen investors.**

2024-05-04,11:55:27,cryptocurrency,"Thirty Years Later, a Speed Boost for Quantum Factoring | Quanta Magazine","This is the most overlooked consideration when people talk about how many logical qubits are required to break the encryption we use for digital signing.

Yes, 30 years ago Shor showed us one potential method that imposed risk.   Sadly, people seem to think it is the only method. 

But there hasn't been a lot of people trying to find faster methods using quantum computing.  

The article share one example of a faster approach.   Martin Ekera also published Quantum algorithms for computing short discrete logarithms and factoring RSA integers in 2017.

So, we now see error correction advancements, multiple scaling approaches,  hybrid models,  major money,  and improving mathematical methods. 

This is why Apple and Google have already been upgrading encryption.  And the white house and EU signed orders to start preparing. 

Vitalik outlined an a plan in case of an emergency and I hope he is looking at a non emergency implementation.  

Btc should be doing the same. 

It's not trivial and there will be difficulties/impacts.

All systems will need to deal with this (and yes, the banks and military and every other important system are actively preparing).  

Starting now will allow for good decisions to minimize impacts.  

Decentralized systems face much bigger challenges in implementing changes.  Especially since solutions likely require users to take action with their wallets to transition to secure signing methods.

2024-04-16,15:54:46,cryptocurrency,6 Reasons Bitcoin Will Hit $200k After the Halving,"As Bitcoin approaches its fourth halving in April, anticipation mounts regarding its trajectory post-event. With predictions ranging from¬†[$3.8 million per Bitcoin (Cathie Woods of Ark Investment)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/cathie-woods-new-price-target-for-bitcoin-is-38-million/ar-BB1knhXP) to [being¬†worthless (Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/17/jamie-dimon-says-hes-done-talking-about-bitcoin-i-dont-care.html), the whole community is engaged in the event.

With the halving set to reduce Bitcoin‚Äôs mining rewards to 3.125 BTC per block, a critical shift is occurring in its economic landscape further flattening its supply curve and accelerating the transition from an inflationary to a deflationary asset. As time goes by and the scarcity of each Bitcoin increases, natural economic forces will act to push prices upwards in response to increasing demand.

Amidst a macroeconomic cultural shift, traditional investments like real estate, once favoured by baby boomers, are losing appeal among millennials and Gen Zers. Instead, the new generations are increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies as an alternative investment. They are drawn by the perceived advantages of greater flexibility, lower barriers to entry and potentially higher returns.

In the following sections, we dive deep into the pivotal factors we think will fuel Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise post halving.

**Reason 1: Increased Confidence**

From a code perspective, the protocol adjustment that will occur on block 840,000 is a relatively minor event. In prior halvings, scepticism towards the technology and its reliability were constantly questioned. Each halving event is psychologically associated with a proven track record that yet again, Bitcoin will execute against its intended purpose promised in the original whitepaper back in 2008. As an asset class, Bitcoin is still in its infancy and halvings bring a boost of confidence to outside observers and those not yet invested.

**Reason 2: Slowing Inflation Drives Value**

The first lesson in Economics is one of supply and demand. With a reduced supply and a constant or increasing demand, prices will rise in all markets. Bitcoin is no different in this respect. Its supply is designed to reduce over time and with Bitcoin‚Äôs constantly being lost (this is the nature of all currencies), the only direction for the price to head is upwards.

**Reason 3: Hype and Network Effects**

Halving events draw¬†[substantial media attention](https://defidive.com/news?filter=bitcoin)¬†with the community actively driving discussions across various platforms. The heightened visibility contributes to a surge in market speculation, fueled by increased liquidity. Consequently, the combination of widespread awareness and heightened trading activity propels Bitcoin's price upward.

[Source: DefiDive Realtime Bitcoin News Page](https://preview.redd.it/wofkb7dyjuuc1.png?width=2120&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dbd803698d444d46ae988229af00fa5d24d8fe1)

The Oxford English dictionary defines a network effect as ‚Äúa phenomenon whereby a product or service gains additional value as more people use it‚Äù. Everyday examples of network effects are found on messaging platforms such as WhatsApp or Telegram, social media platforms such as Instagram or TikTok and online marketplaces such as Airbnb or eBay. It's not hard to see that in these examples, the greater the user base, the better the experience as a positive feedback loop ensures that an increasing user base encourages and attracts more participants.

With Bitcoin, as its ecosystem matures, its utility and value proposition increases with each independent actor whether private holder, institutional investor or state actors begin to increase their own holdings in the cryptocurrency.

**Reason 4: Easier Access**

Demand for Bitcoin has never been higher‚Ä¶ and access to Bitcoin through exchanges, wallet service providers and now regulated financial instruments such as the Bitcoin ETFs has never been easier. With institutional capital now able to access Bitcoin through their brokers, more companies will have the ability to park cash assets into crypto assets providing further shareholder value as we have seen with¬†Michael Saylor‚Äôs Microstrategy¬†and¬†Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla, both choosing to park profits aside in the cryptocurrency.

**Reason 5: A Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty**

Increasing government debt over time has led to a landscape of economic instability characterized by cyclical periods of boom and busts occurring every 8-10 years. Amidst the macroeconomic uncertainty, currency devaluations are deemed an important tool establishing a gloomy backdrop. In this environment, Bitcoin is emerging as a prime hedge against uncertainty, offering an attractive alternative against the concerns of the current financial system.

**Reason 6: Historical Price (1 year comparisons)**

Let‚Äôs look at the history of Bitcoin‚Äôs price during the halving:

**First halving happened on**

November 28, 2012 - BTC $12.54

Price on November 28, 2013 - BTC $1,050

This historical growth suggests that Bitcoin has the potential for significant post-halving growth, further fuelling expectations of a $200k price tag.

**Conclusion**

While historical trends cannot predict future performance, Bitcoin‚Äôs past shows us remarkable price surges following halving events. At¬†[DefiDive](https://defidive.com/)¬†our team have traded Bitcoin since 2011 and strongly hold a belief that this time will be no different, in a past blog post¬†[we set a target price of $92,000 per Bitcoin](https://defidive.com/blog/what-is-bitcoin-really-worth), this year we adjust our target to a 2024 top of $200,000 per Bitcoin. The price charts show Bitcoin‚Äôs gains in the past have been influenced heavily by huge demand which in 2024 is much more significant than ever before. This moment will signify the first halving since Bitcoin became a regulated asset class.¬†**Instead of us Bitcoiners having to constantly answer why we hold Bitcoin.

2024-04-13,14:47:48,cryptocurrency,European Commission Advocates for a United Shift to Quantum-Resistant Cryptography,"About a month ago Vitalik noted his plan in case of a quantum computing emergency, and Apple released news of implementing post quantum encryption. 

This week the European Commission is raising the issue, similar to what the United States did over a year ago.

These events are raising the tough questions about when - and how - will systems implement digital signing with encryption that can withstand quantum computing.

This is something ALL systems will need to do.  Until now, the topic has been largely ignored.  There are solutions that can be implemented, and while it is assumed there are more lucrative targets than crypto, we may find that crypto is the least risky target and may be the last prepared.

Note that the blockchain history of most major coins appears to be fine- it really is the issue of signing and protecting your private keys where the weakness is, and why it is a bit tricky to upgrade that in a way that limits disruption for users and the ecosystems.

Below are some projects that have planned, developed, and/or prepared for quantum computing. 

Their focus is much more than just being prepared for quantum resistance.  However, they will benefit from this topic coming into focus since they have planned for quantum resistance all along.

In the end, all chains and systems will need to prepare. The question will be how well projects navigate this. Being prepared from the beginning offers obvious advantages.

Algo- it appears to have added Falcon as quantum resistance for consensus purposes, but I haven't seen if they have a solution defined for Digital Signature- which is the primary issue requiring quantum resistance. This is a long standing layer1.  I saw a recent post it is at its ATL against BTC.  Could be worth a look if it gains momentum.

CELL- had a nice run-up early in the year, but now over 50% pullback. CELL follows more of a DOT type design. Not sure the reason for such a large pullback, as this happened well before the market pullback yesterday.

XX, AME, XEP, HBAR and a few others I know less about have been mentioned for preparing.  I don't have details to add here, but worth researching.

QRL- Built for QR years ago.  Has put a lot of research into the topic.  Biggest issue has been availability to buy.  We saw once it was available on Mexc, it made a nice run.  Still working to add in evm compatibility and smart contracts which would put it in a much better position for adoption and to be available on swaps. Seems to be holding it's new level even with market pullback.

QANX- Had a nice run with news Ethereum board member Patrick Storchenegger is now CEO of QAN‚Äôs Intellectual Property (IP) holding company, and has partnered with an EU country to use their QR tech stack. Testnet due this month which should initiate marketing plans. ETH like design, PoS, with evm compatible smart contracts in any programming language.

As we zoom in on the intricate details of this Bitcoin chart, we‚Äôre essentially time traveling through the life story of a revolutionary currency. This isn't just a tale of wild price swings; it‚Äôs a deep dive into how Bitcoin has weaved itself into the fabric of global finance. We've seen it grow from a digital seedling into a towering tree in the financial forest, its roots spreading far and wide.   


Our story begins when Bitcoin was just whispers in cyberspace, valued at mere cents. It‚Äôs akin to finding an old treasure map, leading to a chest that's now worth billions. Then 2013 hit, and Bitcoin grabbed the world‚Äôs attention ‚Äî not all for good reasons, mind you, with the Silk Road and Mt. Gox putting it through its paces. Those were testing times, but Bitcoin showed its mettle, bouncing back each time.   


Marching down the timeline, we encounter pivotal moments like when Germany gave Bitcoin a regulatory nod, the halving events that sharpen Bitcoin's scarcity edge, and the growing wave of institutional investments. Each of these milestones is like a stepping stone that Bitcoin used to cross the river of uncertainty, inching closer to the mainstream shore.   


Fast-forward to 2017, and we find Bitcoin riding a wave of enthusiasm, propelled by a flood of ICOs. It‚Äôs a dizzying climb, with a peak that had everyone talking. But then, as the adage goes, what goes up must come down, and 2018 brought the sobering chill of the crypto winter. This was the market's way of saying, ‚ÄúTake a breath, reassess, and plan your next move.‚Äù   


In 2021, Bitcoin came back with a vengeance, reaching dizzying new heights. This wasn‚Äôt just about investors jumping on a bandwagon; it was about big players, from corporations to hedge funds, recognizing Bitcoin‚Äôs potential. But then, the tides turned in 2022, as macroeconomic pressures, from inflation concerns to tightening monetary policy, caused the market to shiver and shake off some of its gains.   


And just when we thought we had seen it all, the Bitcoin saga continued into 2022 and 2023, years that would test the mettle of investors and the resilience of the crypto ecosystem. The narrative took a dramatic turn as the market faced the headwinds of change. Inflation was no longer a specter looming on the horizon; it became a stark reality, sending central banks into a frenzy of monetary tightening. The ripples of this new economic stance were felt throughout the Bitcoin market, sending shivers down the spine of the crypto world and triggering a sell-off that would see Bitcoin shed a significant portion of its value.   


But even as the value wavered, the technology didn't stand still. Innovations within the blockchain space continued, with improvements to scalability and security, not to mention the ever-expanding universe of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Skepticism was still a frequent guest at the table, but for every doubter, there was an innovator, pushing the boundaries of what crypto could be.   


As we turned the page to 2024, the crypto community was holding its breath in anticipation. Would this be the year of recovery, the year when Bitcoin would defy the odds and rebound? Or would it be another year of challenges and character-building for the world's premier cryptocurrency? The introduction of more sophisticated regulatory frameworks began to pave a clearer path for institutional adoption, and whispers of the next halving event started to stir the market's imagination.   


Bitcoin's dance with mainstream finance became more intricate. There were stumbles, sure, but every step was a lesson learned. The chart became not just a reflection of past price movements, but a ledger of Bitcoin's ongoing maturation‚Äîa digital asset growing up in a world still grappling with its implications.   


Behind the scenes, this chart captures the tug-of-war between innovation and skepticism. For instance, the social media giants, with their advertising clampdown, had Bitcoin on the ropes for a bit. Yet, each technological milestone, each regulatory hurdle crossed, has added to Bitcoin's credibility.   


Then, we have the environmental subplot, where Tesla's dance with Bitcoin highlighted the growing pains of an industry grappling with sustainability. It‚Äôs like watching a fledgling industry mature, grappling with its identity and its impact on the planet.   


Why are we sharing this story in all its technicolor detail? Because it‚Äôs about more than just investment and market speculation. It's a historical document for future market historians, a lesson book for current investors, and a crystal ball for those trying to catch a glimpse of the future.   


This chart is a saga of resilience, bursting with tales of technical revolutions, economic shake-ups, regulatory cliffhangers, and the tireless human spirit driving it all. It‚Äôs the chronicle of an underdog that‚Äôs fighting for its place in the financial hall of fame.   


But wait, there's more. This isn't just about recounting past glories and missteps. It's about sketching out the forces that may shape Bitcoin's journey ahead. It‚Äôs about seeing the patterns, the peaks, the troughs, and gearing up for the next chapter in this blockbuster saga.   


In wrapping up this lengthy, winding narrative, we come back to where we are now: Bitcoin, standing tall amidst the shifting sands of finance and technology. This chart isn't just a snapshot; it‚Äôs a living, breathing tale of an asset that's as enigmatic as it is exciting. It‚Äôs about understanding the past to navigate the future‚Äôs uncertain waters. So here‚Äôs to Bitcoin, the digital enigma, the currency of tomorrow, and here‚Äôs to the unwritten chapters that we‚Äôll be charting next.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-04-03,11:47:46,cryptocurrency,Reasons Why Some Believe Elon Musk Could Be Satoshi Nakamoto and Doge could have a big part!," After my previous post sparked debate, I want to focus on more reasons supporting the theory that Elon Musk could be Satoshi Nakamoto and √êoge could in return, have something to do with it. 


1. Background in Computer Science and Technology:   Elon Musk's early ventures, such as Zip2 and X.com, demonstrate his technical expertise relevant to Bitcoin's development.

2. Interest in Cryptography:   Musk's involvement in encryption and security through projects like X, SpaceX and Tesla highlights his knowledge in cryptography, a key aspect of Bitcoin.

3. Early Interest in Digital Payments:   Musk's role in the founding of X.com and PayPal shows his early recognition of the potential of digital payments and cryptocurrencies.

4. Programming Language and Code Similarities:    Bitcoin's code is written in C++, a programming language known for its efficiency and versatility. Elon Musk's ventures, including SpaceX and Tesla, also utilize C++ in their software development, highlighting a shared technical preference.

5. Similar Text Style:   Both Elon Musk and Satoshi Nakamoto have a distinctive and often cryptic writing style. Their communication is concise, technical, and direct.

6. Advocacy for Transparency, Openness, and Global Perspective:   Elon Musk has been a vocal advocate for transparency and open communication, which are also principles valued by the Bitcoin community. His support for open source technology and collaboration aligns with the ethos of Bitcoin's open development process. Similarly, his companies, including ""X"" (Twitter), also emphasize openness and transparency in their operations and communication, reflecting a shared commitment to these principles across his ventures. Additionally, both Elon Musk and the Bitcoin community have a global perspective, aiming to create solutions that benefit people worldwide and transcend geographical boundaries.

7. Timely Involvement with √êogecoin:   Elon Musk's notable involvement with √êogecoin, particularly his tweets and endorsements, coincided with significant events in the cryptocurrency world. His support for √êogecoin leading up to the Bitcoin halving and the date 4/20, known as DogeDay in the community, suggests a strategic and timely interest in the crypto space. This timing has led some to speculate about a potential connection between Elon Musk and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, including Bitcoin.

8. Potential Role of √êogecoin:   If Elon Musk were Satoshi Nakamoto, √êogecoin could play a significant role in promoting generosity and doing good. A coin that strives for ""doing only good everyday"" could encourage a more positive and generous world.


 It's worth noting that my previous post received a lot of hate, which raises questions about the negativity some people harbor towards innovative ideas and possibilities. The strong negative reactions emphasize the need for a more welcoming and positive cryptocurrency community, making √êogecoin's ethos of kindness and generosity even more relevant and necessary.

2024-04-02,01:46:29,cryptocurrency,Having trouble swapping crypto back into ethereum. Help and advice appreciated! ," I‚Äôm not new to investing or trading. I‚Äôve held stocks and cryptocurrencies for years on platforms Etrade, robinhood, coinbase, etc. I‚Äôm no expert when it comes to trading, but I atleast have basic knowledge of how spreads, volume, options, after hours, etc works.

However I‚Äôve recently begun exploring very high risk high reward investing ideas - specifically looking into alternate cryptocurrencies. I‚Äôm still in the learning process of how it all works. What a wallet is, network fees, blockchains, swapping, etc  ‚Ä¶so forgive me if my current situation (which I‚Äôm about to explain) sounds ignorant and dumb. Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at:

I wanted to buy a specific crypto (let‚Äôs call it ‚Äúxyz‚Äù coin) that has a market cap of around $200 million. I realized the process to buy this would be more complicated than the process of buying a blue chip stock like Apple or a major cryptocurrency like ethereum so here‚Äôs what I did‚Ä¶

I created a coinbase account and set up my coinbase wallet as well. I transferred about 1 full ethereum from Robinhood to coinbase. Then I transferred that same ethereum from coinbase to coinbase wallet(I have the app). After that I swapped around 0.1 ethereum to ‚Äúxyz‚Äù coins  just as kind of a test to make sure everything was working properly. So far so good. The problem is if I try to swap ‚Äúxyz‚Äù coins back into ethereum it says ‚Äúthis transaction will likely fail, if it does you‚Äôll lose the network fee‚Äù. In attempts to solve this I‚Äôve tried the following:

‚Ä¢changing the amount I‚Äôm sending - I‚Äôve explored ranges from $10 to $400 

‚Ä¢changing the slippage tolerance - I‚Äôve bumped it as high as 50% without success

‚Ä¢not ‚Äúswapping‚Äù but sending it back to my ethereum wallet - what this did was convert ‚Äúxyz‚Äù to ‚Äúxyz‚Äù rather than ‚Äúxyz‚Äù to Etheruem which I had hoped. - yes I have much to learn about this stuff lol

So to conclude - what is the real issue here? I understand that most of these coins are scams so is my investment just lost? Should I buy these kinds of coins using a different method? I figured the size and volume of this ‚Äúxyz‚Äù coin would mean there wouldn‚Äôt be issues with not having enough buyers and sellers to make trades. Am I wrong about that? Any help/advice is greatly appreciated!

2024-03-30,11:44:15,cryptocurrency,IBM advancements in error correction. QR coin updates,"Vitalik recently noted his plan in case of a quantum computing emergency,  and Apple recently implemented post quantum encryption. 

These events have raised questions about when ALL systems need to begin digital signing with encryption that can withstand quantum computing.  

News this week centers around IBM and error correction.  ""While error correction is not a solved problem, this new code makes clear the path toward running quantum circuits with a billion gates or more on our superconducting transmon qubit hardware.‚Äù

What this means,  simply,  is there continue to be rapid advancements.  And so upgrading is inevitable.  Each coin needs to consider the best path forward, because this is a potential security risk.   And with crypto,  users will need to know what their next steps are to protect their assets.

Below are some projects with the QR label.  Their main focus isn't just being prepared for quantum resistance.

They do stand to benefit from the narrative since they have planned for quantum resistance all along.  Being prepared from the beginning offers obvious advantages.

Algo-  it appears to have added Falcon as quantum resistance for consensus purposes, but I haven't seen if they have a solution defined for Digital Signature- which is the primary issue requiring quantum resistance.  This is a long standing layer1.

CELL- had a nice run-up since Jan. A decent pullback recently which might offer opportunity. Appears to be more of a DOT type design. Had a Coin Bureau club review video which didn't do much, but some buzz around Kelvpn seems to be helping.  Latest news around 2 way bridge. 

QRL- Built for QR years ago, and was quiet until recently. May have been because it was hard to buy, but Mexc was added, and they are working to add in evm and smart contracts.  Seems to be holding it's new level.

2024-03-22,18:36:15,cryptocurrency,QR coin update. BTC considering BIP proposals to be ready like Vitalik?,"Some very good conversations going on around what approach to take with upgrading for QR (Quantum Resistance).  Most of this got a lot of attention after Apple revealed their QR solution, along with Vitalik referring to a potential emergency plan if it became necessary.  


The discussion often turns to ""when"" changes need to be implemented, and some of that will depend on what user action is required.  From the conversation below, it looks like the currently recommended QR encryption methods may not be an ideal solution.  But, these are also the best options known after years of effort to see what can protect against quantum capabilities.  So BTC may have to work within these constraints.  


The goal of course will be to minimize disruption and provide the necessary time to develop and allow users to make the transition if necessary.

2024-03-22,10:29:30,cryptocurrency,"AMA Announcement: Unveiling the Future of Decentralized AI and Software Development with Tau Net ($AGRS) - March 25th, 6pm UTC - 1500 USDT Giveaway"," Greetings, r/Cryptocurrency community!

We're thrilled to announce that the Tau Net team will be hosting an AMA session right here on **March 25th at 6pm UTC**. This is your chance to dive deep into the innovative world of Tau Net & Agoras ($AGRS), a project at the forefront of reshaping how we conceive software development and decentralized AI.

**1500 USDT Giveaway**

To make this AMA extra special, we're giving away **1500 USDT** to the top 15 questions (100 USDT each). Share your most insightful, curious, or inspiring questions for a chance to win.

**Who We Are**

We are Tau (www.tau.net), a ten year old software company pioneering **logical AI** software development. We‚Äôve developed a novel formal specification language, called Tau Language, intended for precise and accurate development of mission critical systems and complex software. Our novel use of formal specification enables **correct-by-construction software development**, thereby eliminating many of the problems that software development and machine learning AI still face, e.g. bugs, traditional testing costs, hefty maintenance, AI hallucination and many technical barriers to participation in development, ultimately enabling anyone to be a developer.

**What is Tau Net**

Tau Net is a decentralized blockchain network fully controlled, governed and developed by its entire user base in a sound manner. By allowing all users to write information in its system e.g. human knowledge, personal opinions and desired behavior for the system to function in logical sentences that work as formal specifications, these sentences are directly executable and thereby function as working software. Tau Net logically reasons over the collective requirements given by its users and detects the agreement on how they want it to function, and puts its own next version as the next block in its blockchain, evolving from block to block, resulting in rapid collaborative development.

**Agoras: Currency of Tau**

Agoras is the currency of Tau Net. $AGRS pioneers in facilitating the exchange of knowledge, computational assets, and derivatives within the Tau Net ecosystem. Uniquely, $AGRS stands as the world‚Äôs first token with user-controlled tokenomics. Users describe in logical sentences how they want $AGRS to be like and Tau Net automatically detects and implements the agreement as executable software, empowers Tau Net‚Äôs users to effortlessly modify the tokenomics, simply by voicing their desired specification.

**What are our breakthroughs?**

NVIDIA‚Äôs CEO shares a vision similar to our future of Software and AI ([https://x.com/Carnage4Life/status/1761483377365152234?s=20](https://x.com/Carnage4Life/status/1761483377365152234?s=20)).

Tau Net introduces the concept of ""Software as Sentences."" This is a new method of developing software, utilizing executable formal specifications, different from code and typical machine learning e.g. ChatGPT. It enables users to describe how they want the network to be like in logical sentences. These logical sentences are processed and understood by the network and directly executable as software, accurate according to the description. Agoras ($AGRS) leverages this technology to allow user-controlled tokenomics, and a decentralized marketplace for knowledge, derivatives, and computational resources.

**Redefining AI: Logic-based AI vs. ML-based AI**

Today‚Äôs most popular AI applications (ChatGPT, Bard, etc) rely on machine learning, a probabilistic approach which is unable to guarantee accurate results. Contrarily, Tau Net employs logic-based AI, thereby being able to handle logical reasoning and deduce new facts from given knowledge, all while guaranteeing that the result is completely accurate according to knowledge provided. In addition, Tau Net is also able to explain to the user how it arrived at a result. Therefore, Tau Net is superior in its reasoning capabilities compared to machine learning based alternatives. By offering formal proofs of correctness, it addresses a pivotal challenge in the AI domain achieving absolute certainty in outcomes.

**User-Controlled Software and AI Governance**

On Tau Net, users are granted unprecedented control over the network. Tau Net provides an effective solution to the AI alignment problem by enabling users to define rules or embed regulations directly within its software. These rules are adhered to with proof, even after any future updates. It possesses the unique capability to automatically reject any attempts at tampering with its software, especially if such attempts aim to introduce undesired behavior. For instance, if the command ""Never send private data over the network"" is embedded, Tau Net will consistently honor this rule, automatically rejecting any future updates that contravene it. This level of software integrity and compliance is unparalleled in the technology domain and important to ensure system integrity.

**Unlocking AGI: Collective Intelligence and Combined Brainpower on Tau Net**

On Tau Net, collective intelligence emerges as users input their knowledge via descriptions in logical sentences enabled by Tau Language. Tau Net is able to reason over given knowledge, as well as combining knowledge and thereby deducing new enlightening facts and groundbreaking discoveries. Every piece of knowledge becomes maximally useful, lying dormant until connected with another fact, potentially yielding solutions to some of the world's biggest problems. This synergy propels Tau Net on the fastest path towards realizing AGI, marking a pivotal shift in how we harness and leverage collective intelligence for humanity‚Äôs betterment. Furthermore, this paradigm facilitates a knowledge market to trade and connect knowledge and brain power using $AGRS.

**Conclusion**

While many blockchain initiatives, such as Bitcoin, proclaim decentralization, they operate under centralized development teams. Contrarily, Tau Net may be described as a decentralized, expansive reasoning system, that empowers users to contribute information that simultaneously serves as software, which Tau Net is able process and integrate into subsequent versions. This unique approach fosters mass collective intelligence, enabling rapid, robust collaborative development, and truly decentralizes the development process in a coherent manner.

**Upcoming Milestones: Tau Language & Testnet**

We're on the brink of releasing the **Tau Language and Testnet**, major milestones that will significantly enhance our ecosystem's capabilities. These developments are a testament to our commitment to innovation and our vision for a decentralized future.

**Join Us: AMA Details and Resources**

Mark your calendars for **March 25th at 6pm UTC** and prepare your questions. Whether you're curious about the technical aspects, the vision behind Tau Net, or how you can get involved, we're here to answer.

2024-03-19,15:36:08,cryptocurrency,Just digital gold,"It occurred to me freshly this morning that this community (the including myself) doesn‚Äôt fully appreciate what ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù means. 

First, I want to disclaim: I‚Äôm skeptical that bitcoin can do everything. I‚Äôm above-average versed in the potential of Bitcoin L2s and L3s. But, there‚Äôs almost no question to me that something like a Solana has an important place as a high TPS platform. So, alts aren‚Äôt exactly ‚Äú****coins‚Äù to me. They are venture capital, and they will produce important things. 

The general consensus, I think, is that Bitcoin has or will have achieved the role of ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù. I think that‚Äôs fair. I think we all know no one will be building games on Bitcoin, for example. That seems silly. And games are a big part of our economy. 

But, I don‚Äôt think we all appreciate what ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù means. This is because gold itself hasn‚Äôt been used as the base layer of money properly in most all of our lifetimes. When gold was at its height, it was *the* measuring stick for *all* monetary value in the majority of the developed world. 

Let‚Äôs try to see what that means (just looking this up now):

Total market cap of the top three companies in the world right now equals ~8 trillion. Total market cap of gold by itself right now is ~14.5 trillion. Let‚Äôs call this the top3 to gold ratio, and it‚Äôs about 0.55:1

Here‚Äôs the current picture:

Microsoft 211.29b rev, 3.1T mcap  
Apple:   383b rev, 2.68 mcap
Nvidia: 26.97b rev  , 2.21 mcap
Avg: 621.26rev , 2.66mcap
Valuation ratio: mcap= 4.28x annual revenue 
Gold 2154 per ounce 
Top 3 companies market cap is equivalent to the value of 3.7 billion ounces of gold


Lets look at 1929:

Standard Oil: 1.52 million rev
General Motors: 1.5 million rev
Ford: 1.14 million 
Average: 1.39m rev (*4.28)= 5.95m mcap.
Gold in 1929: 20.67 per ounce
Top 3 companies market cap was equivalent to the value of 287,865 ounces of gold in 1929

So, in a sense gold has been devalued today compared to 1929.

There‚Äôs all kinds of problems with the above comparison. We didn‚Äôt use modern multiples for companies back then. Global markets mean top products *should* be worth more. (Although keep in mind I compared revenues, so this should be accounted for somewhat). Etc. 


But, the general point is that gold was more dominant in 1929 than it is today. When we say Bitcoin is digital gold, we should think about it closer to 1929 gold than modern gold. This means we‚Äôre underestimating how big that is. The measuring stick for *all* monetary value has a very large addressable market. 

I‚Äôm more sure that Bitcoin becomes gold than I am that Solana becomes Microsoft, for example. 

There are problems with that comparison too, I know. That‚Äôs less important. My bigger point is that we shouldn‚Äôt sleep on what digital gold means.

2024-03-17,17:50:18,cryptocurrency,Crypto vs Tech Stocks: Is crypto really as risky as the SEC says it is?,"On the 10th January 2024, history was made when the SEC granted the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the USA. The SEC was reluctant to approve the ETFs because, if you take them for their word, they wish to protect investors from speculative assets and losing money. So their statement of approval contained words of caution: ‚Äúbitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset.‚Äù and ‚ÄúInvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto‚Äù.

In this post I want to focus on the SEC‚Äôs warning that Bitcoin, and crypto in general, is a high risk investment. In isolation, that statement may be true. But plenty of tradable assets, approved by the SEC, are also considered ‚Äòrisky‚Äô. I couldn‚Äôt find SEC statements warning against investing in specific assets besides Bitcoin. So the implication here is that Bitcoin is especially risky, to the extent that investors should be warned against it so they do not lose money.

As a fun and informative exercise, I made four comparisons to highlight the relative risk of crypto vs tech stocks:

1. The worst investments anyone could have made ever

1. The worst investments from the most recent market crash

1. The largest market cap loss

1. ROI loss per day, historically and recently

This is a long post and I want to point out that if you appreciate clear data and objective analysis you might want to check out [DefiDive.com](https://defidive.com). This is a crypto price, news and asset management terminal that I have built. For now, think of it like Coinmarketcap with less clutter and distractions.

| Peloton | Dec-2020 | Feb-2024 | $167.37 | $3.96 | $2 | -98% |

The worst investment possible in Bitcoin returned a -91% ROI and in Ethereum -93% ROI. In contrast, the ‚Äòleast worst‚Äô investment is Alphabet with -65% ROI, the median investment is  Nvidia with -87% ROI, and the worst investment possible is Peoloton with -98% ROI. Bitcoin and Ethereum have produced bad losses for anyone buying the top and selling the bottom, but other tech stocks (Amazon, AMD, Peloton) have delivered worse ROI for unlucky investors.

It is worth noting that the market cap of Bitcoin in 2011 was $173MM vs Google in 2007 was $231B. In other words, Bitcoin was worth 0.07% of Google. Comparing Bitcoin‚Äôs market crash vs publicly traded tech stocks puts Bitcoin at a disadvantage because these tech stocks only have tradable shares once the company has grown to be large enough to list on a stock market. For example, Google was founded six years before becoming a publicly traded stock in 2004. Bitcoin became publicly tradable within a year of creation and Ethereum was publicly tradable from the moment it was launched. Ultimately we are comparing Bitcoin at age two years old, Ethereum three years old, and Google nine years old. It is reasonable to expect higher volatility from newer and smaller assets.

All of the assets reached their respective bubble tops and market crashes at slightly different times, and Peloton might not have bottomed out yet.

To avoid penalising assets just for being small, comparing the maximum market cap lost is another useful perspective. Amazon is the only asset to lose over $1 Trillion in value. Ethereum performs better than an average for the first time in this analysis. The ranking of this table suggests Bitcoin is comparable to Big Tech, while Ethereum is comparable to the large cap tech.

By none of the measures studied so far has Bitcoin or Ethereum performed the worst. Some might argue that perhaps the risk in crypto comes from the speed at which an investor might lose money. So the following analysis looks at ROI % loss per day during market crashes.

**4. ROI Loss per Day: Crypto vs Tech Stocks** 

All-time worst market crash comparison:

Asset | Start Date | Crash Length (Days) | Average % change per Day 
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
| Microsoft | Dec-1999 | 3350 | -0.02% |
| AMD | Jan-2006 | 3530 | -0.03% |
| Apple | Mar-2000 | 1126 | -0.07% |
| Zoom | Nov-2020 | 1064 | -0.08% |
| Peloton | Dec-2020 | 1157 | -0.08% |
| Amazon | Apr-1999 | 884 | -0.11% |
| Alphabet (GOOGL) | Oct-2007 | 397 | -0.16% |
| Netflix | May-2011 | 458 | -0.17% |
| Meta | Aug-2021 | 426 | -0.18% |
| Tesla | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.19% |
| Ethereum | Jan-2018 | 334 | -0.28% |
| Nvidia | Dec-2001 | 274 | -0.32% |
| Bitcoin | Jun-2011 | 153 | -0.60% |

Bitcoin lost -0.60% per day (average, non-compounding) during the 2011 crash. Which is almost twice as the next worst asset, Nvidia. However, we already established that Bitcoin was so small in 2011 that we aren‚Äôt making a fair comparison here. In the most recent market crash, Bitcoin‚Äôs ROI loss per day was -0.21%, which is similar to other tech stocks (see next table below)

Most recent market crash comparison:

Asset | Start Date | Crash Length (Days) | Average % change per Day 
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
| Zoom | Nov-2020 | 1064 | -0.08% |
| Peloton | Dec-2020 | 1157 | -0.08% |
| Apple | Dec-2021 | 365 | -0.08% |
| Alphabet (GOOG) | Oct-2021 | 426 | -0.10% |
| Microsoft | Dec-2021 | 304 | -0.12% |
| Amazon | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.14% |
| Meta | Aug-2021 | 426 | -0.18% |
| Tesla | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.19% |
| AMD | Nov-2021 | 334 | -0.20% |
| Bitcoin | Nov-2021 | 365 | -0.21% |
| Nvidia | Nov-2021 | 304 | -0.22% |
| Netflix | Oct-2021 | 243 | -0.31% |
| Ethereum | Nov-2021 | 242 | -0.32% |

In the most recent crash Ethereum lost -0.32% per day (average non-compounding). That is clearly the worst result here, but only one percentage point worse than Netflix. It is somewhat impressive that Zoom and Peloton have the lowest average ROI loss per day, but that is limited comfort to investors if the stock price never recovers. Objectively, with Ethereum already rebounding from $1.1K in Dec-22 to $3.9K in Mar-24, Ethereum has been a better investment than Peloton even if you did get rekt along the way.

**Conclusion**

Out of everything I have studied (not all of which made it into the final cut of this blog post), I find this graph the most useful for summarising potential losses when investing in crypto and tech stocks:

https://i.imgur.com/akl87Jk.png

Looking back at the SEC‚Äôs statement, it does seem unfair to single Bitcoin out as a volatile asset when Bitcoin performed similarly to commonly traded tech stocks during the most recent market crash. It feels like the SEC statement is talking about Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility as if it is 2011. If we were to take the SEC‚Äôs statement as gospel, we would expect this analysis to show Bitcoin and Ethereum are significantly more risky than tech stocks. Instead Bitcoin performed similarly to other tech stocks during the recent market crash and Ethereum performed not much worse. 

**A Sidenote on Beta**

Beta is a measure of an asset's correlation to the broader market. This can be used as a proxy for measuring risk. Tech stocks have become so large that they effectively become ‚Äòthe broader market‚Äô. You can see below they all have betas close to one. In other words, if big tech share prices go up (or down), so does the S&P 500. Crypto has little correlation to the S&P 500, partly because it has outperformed it over the past 14 years. This gives crypto a beta close to 0, which effectively means anything or nothing could happen when the S&P 500 rises or falls. The beta for crypto has increased since 2020 but it is still far away from other tech stocks. In practice, this means that crypto could be considered as a method to diversify away from tech stocks / S&P 500. Ironically, you could make the argument that this helps lower the overall risk of a portfolio if someone invests sensibly into crypto to achieve more diversification.

Asset | Beta | Interpretation |
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
| Ethereum | 0.08 | The asset‚Äôs price movements are independent of market movements. |
| Bitcoin | 0.20 | The asset‚Äôs price movements are independent of market movements. |
| Microsoft | 0.95 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset‚Äôs price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |
| Alphabet (GOOGL) | 1.05 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset‚Äôs price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |

| Amazon | 1.12 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset‚Äôs price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |
| Netflix | 1.15 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset‚Äôs price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |
| Meta | 1.34 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset‚Äôs price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |
| Zoom | 1.36 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset‚Äôs price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |
| AMD | 1.48 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset‚Äôs price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |
| Nvidia | 1.78 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset‚Äôs price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |
| Tesla | 1.95 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset‚Äôs price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |

2024-03-17,17:50:18,cryptocurrency,Crypto vs Tech Stocks: Is crypto really as risky as the SEC says it is?,"On the 10th January 2024, history was made when the SEC granted the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the USA. The SEC was reluctant to approve the ETFs because, if you take them for their word, they wish to protect investors from speculative assets and losing money. So their statement of approval contained words of caution: ‚Äúbitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset.‚Äù and ‚ÄúInvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto‚Äù.

In this post I want to focus on the SEC‚Äôs warning that Bitcoin, and crypto in general, is a high risk investment. In isolation, that statement may be true. But plenty of tradable assets, approved by the SEC, are also considered ‚Äòrisky‚Äô. I couldn‚Äôt find SEC statements warning against investing in specific assets besides Bitcoin. So the implication here is that Bitcoin is especially risky, to the extent that investors should be warned against it so they do not lose money.

As a fun and informative exercise, I made four comparisons to highlight the relative risk of crypto vs tech stocks:

1. The worst investments anyone could have made ever

1. The worst investments from the most recent market crash

1. The largest market cap loss

1. ROI loss per day, historically and recently

This is a long post and I want to point out that if you appreciate clear data and objective analysis you might want to check out [DefiDive.com](https://defidive.com). This is a crypto price, news and asset management terminal that I have built. For now, think of it like Coinmarketcap with less clutter and distractions.

| Bitcoin | Jun-2011 | 153 | -0.60% |

Bitcoin lost -0.60% per day (average, non-compounding) during the 2011 crash. Which is almost twice as the next worst asset, Nvidia. However, we already established that Bitcoin was so small in 2011 that we aren‚Äôt making a fair comparison here. In the most recent market crash, Bitcoin‚Äôs ROI loss per day was -0.21%, which is similar to other tech stocks (see next table below)

Most recent market crash comparison:

Asset | Start Date | Crash Length (Days) | Average % change per Day 
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
| Zoom | Nov-2020 | 1064 | -0.08% |
| Peloton | Dec-2020 | 1157 | -0.08% |
| Apple | Dec-2021 | 365 | -0.08% |
| Alphabet (GOOG) | Oct-2021 | 426 | -0.10% |
| Microsoft | Dec-2021 | 304 | -0.12% |
| Amazon | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.14% |
| Meta | Aug-2021 | 426 | -0.18% |
| Tesla | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.19% |
| AMD | Nov-2021 | 334 | -0.20% |
| Bitcoin | Nov-2021 | 365 | -0.21% |
| Nvidia | Nov-2021 | 304 | -0.22% |
| Netflix | Oct-2021 | 243 | -0.31% |
| Ethereum | Nov-2021 | 242 | -0.32% |

In the most recent crash Ethereum lost -0.32% per day (average non-compounding). That is clearly the worst result here, but only one percentage point worse than Netflix. It is somewhat impressive that Zoom and Peloton have the lowest average ROI loss per day, but that is limited comfort to investors if the stock price never recovers. Objectively, with Ethereum already rebounding from $1.1K in Dec-22 to $3.9K in Mar-24, Ethereum has been a better investment than Peloton even if you did get rekt along the way.

**Conclusion**

Out of everything I have studied (not all of which made it into the final cut of this blog post), I find this graph the most useful for summarising potential losses when investing in crypto and tech stocks:

https://i.imgur.com/akl87Jk.png

Looking back at the SEC‚Äôs statement, it does seem unfair to single Bitcoin out as a volatile asset when Bitcoin performed similarly to commonly traded tech stocks during the most recent market crash. It feels like the SEC statement is talking about Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility as if it is 2011. If we were to take the SEC‚Äôs statement as gospel, we would expect this analysis to show Bitcoin and Ethereum are significantly more risky than tech stocks. Instead Bitcoin performed similarly to other tech stocks during the recent market crash and Ethereum performed not much worse. 

**A Sidenote on Beta**

Beta is a measure of an asset's correlation to the broader market. This can be used as a proxy for measuring risk. Tech stocks have become so large that they effectively become ‚Äòthe broader market‚Äô. You can see below they all have betas close to one. In other words, if big tech share prices go up (or down), so does the S&P 500. Crypto has little correlation to the S&P 500, partly because it has outperformed it over the past 14 years. This gives crypto a beta close to 0, which effectively means anything or nothing could happen when the S&P 500 rises or falls. The beta for crypto has increased since 2020 but it is still far away from other tech stocks. In practice, this means that crypto could be considered as a method to diversify away from tech stocks / S&P 500. Ironically, you could make the argument that this helps lower the overall risk of a portfolio if someone invests sensibly into crypto to achieve more diversification.

Asset | Beta | Interpretation |
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
| Ethereum | 0.08 | The asset‚Äôs price movements are independent of market movements. |
| Bitcoin | 0.20 | The asset‚Äôs price movements are independent of market movements. |

| Amazon | 1.12 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset‚Äôs price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |

2024-03-17,17:50:18,cryptocurrency,Crypto vs Tech Stocks: Is crypto really as risky as the SEC says it is?,"On the 10th January 2024, history was made when the SEC granted the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the USA. The SEC was reluctant to approve the ETFs because, if you take them for their word, they wish to protect investors from speculative assets and losing money. So their statement of approval contained words of caution: ‚Äúbitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset.‚Äù and ‚ÄúInvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto‚Äù.

In this post I want to focus on the SEC‚Äôs warning that Bitcoin, and crypto in general, is a high risk investment. In isolation, that statement may be true. But plenty of tradable assets, approved by the SEC, are also considered ‚Äòrisky‚Äô. I couldn‚Äôt find SEC statements warning against investing in specific assets besides Bitcoin. So the implication here is that Bitcoin is especially risky, to the extent that investors should be warned against it so they do not lose money.

As a fun and informative exercise, I made four comparisons to highlight the relative risk of crypto vs tech stocks:

1. The worst investments anyone could have made ever

1. The worst investments from the most recent market crash

1. The largest market cap loss

1. ROI loss per day, historically and recently

This is a long post and I want to point out that if you appreciate clear data and objective analysis you might want to check out [DefiDive.com](https://defidive.com). This is a crypto price, news and asset management terminal that I have built. For now, think of it like Coinmarketcap with less clutter and distractions.

**1. Worst Investment Possible: Crypto vs Tech Stocks**

| Zoom | Nov-2020 | Oct-2023 | $505.88 | $58.87 | $12 | -88% |
| Bitcoin | Jun-2011 | Nov-2011 | $26.48 | $2.33 | $9 | -91% |
| Ethereum | Jan-2018 | Dec-2018 | $1,292.63 | $84.47 | $7 | -93% |
| Amazon | Apr-1999 | Sep-2001 | $5.53 | $0.28 | $5 | -95% |
| AMD | Jan-2006 | Sep-2015 | $42.01 | $1.65 | $4 | -96% |
| Peloton | Dec-2020 | Feb-2024 | $167.37 | $3.96 | $2 | -98% |

The worst investment possible in Bitcoin returned a -91% ROI and in Ethereum -93% ROI. In contrast, the ‚Äòleast worst‚Äô investment is Alphabet with -65% ROI, the median investment is  Nvidia with -87% ROI, and the worst investment possible is Peoloton with -98% ROI. Bitcoin and Ethereum have produced bad losses for anyone buying the top and selling the bottom, but other tech stocks (Amazon, AMD, Peloton) have delivered worse ROI for unlucky investors.

It is worth noting that the market cap of Bitcoin in 2011 was $173MM vs Google in 2007 was $231B. In other words, Bitcoin was worth 0.07% of Google. Comparing Bitcoin‚Äôs market crash vs publicly traded tech stocks puts Bitcoin at a disadvantage because these tech stocks only have tradable shares once the company has grown to be large enough to list on a stock market. For example, Google was founded six years before becoming a publicly traded stock in 2004. Bitcoin became publicly tradable within a year of creation and Ethereum was publicly tradable from the moment it was launched. Ultimately we are comparing Bitcoin at age two years old, Ethereum three years old, and Google nine years old. It is reasonable to expect higher volatility from newer and smaller assets.

| Peloton | Dec-2020 | Feb-2024 | $167.37 | $3.96 | $2 | -98% |

Instead of using data from an asset‚Äôs entire history, this table compares the worst investments possible during the most recent market crash. All of the assets reached their respective bubble tops and market crashes at slightly different times, and Peloton might not have bottomed out yet. Bitcoin was the sixth worst asset and Ethereum was the third. This tells the same narrative that crypto investments can produce bad returns, but not necessarily much different from tech stocks.

To avoid penalising assets just for being small, comparing the maximum market cap lost is another useful perspective. Amazon is the only asset to lose over $1 Trillion in value. Ethereum performs better than an average for the first time in this analysis. The ranking of this table suggests Bitcoin is comparable to Big Tech, while Ethereum is comparable to the large cap tech.

By none of the measures studied so far has Bitcoin or Ethereum performed the worst. Some might argue that perhaps the risk in crypto comes from the speed at which an investor might lose money. So the following analysis looks at ROI % loss per day during market crashes.

**4. ROI Loss per Day: Crypto vs Tech Stocks** 

All-time worst market crash comparison:

Asset | Start Date | Crash Length (Days) | Average % change per Day 
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
| Microsoft | Dec-1999 | 3350 | -0.02% |
| AMD | Jan-2006 | 3530 | -0.03% |

| Nvidia | Dec-2001 | 274 | -0.32% |
| Bitcoin | Jun-2011 | 153 | -0.60% |

Bitcoin lost -0.60% per day (average, non-compounding) during the 2011 crash. Which is almost twice as the next worst asset, Nvidia. However, we already established that Bitcoin was so small in 2011 that we aren‚Äôt making a fair comparison here. In the most recent market crash, Bitcoin‚Äôs ROI loss per day was -0.21%, which is similar to other tech stocks (see next table below)

| Ethereum | Nov-2021 | 242 | -0.32% |

In the most recent crash Ethereum lost -0.32% per day (average non-compounding). That is clearly the worst result here, but only one percentage point worse than Netflix. It is somewhat impressive that Zoom and Peloton have the lowest average ROI loss per day, but that is limited comfort to investors if the stock price never recovers.

I know now with Bitcoin Spot ETFs showing up, it does feel as this new cycle will be different but still - I'm watching this indicator closely to get a feel when crypto markets could enter an overheating mode.

2024-03-15,13:09:03,cryptocurrency,ROI on cashback crypto cards," Hi r/CryptoCurrency  


Hear me out, my intend is not to shill anything to you. I'm just putting out an offering in the market which seems a no-brainer to me and I'm curious what y'all think about it and if there are other/even better offerings out there.

I want to present a clear overview to you about the value you can extract out of the CDC, Cronos VISA card program. CDC launched a new campaign in which new or upgrading card holders can receive a reimbursement (paid in CRO) on Apple products via the official website. The important sources to digest all benefits and terms & conditions are the [CDC Visa card program](https://crypto.com/cards) and the [(Limited Edition) Apple product campaign](https://crypto.com/product-news/cardapplepromo). 

To get a grasp of all benefits related to the card I quickly constructed a spreadsheet which calculates the return on your investment (ROI), to make it more comprehensive I provide you with the following example:

\- Imagine you are not yet familiar with CDC but you want to invest (more) into Crypto. Assumption 1: Let's say you want to invest $4000. Assumption 2: On average, you spend around $750 on groceries, clothes, leisure time activities, travelling, ... with the VISA card.

With $4000 dollar you can apply for the ""Royal Indigo & Jade Green"" Visa card. This Visa card tier will give you 2% cashback on all your expenses made with the card and around 4% staking rewards on your locked-up investment of CRO. Other rewards include a reimbursment of your Spotify and Netflix subscription for the first six months. With the Apple campaign, you also enjoy a reimbursement of $800 on Apple products, paid back in CRO.

[Example ROI ](https://preview.redd.it/0fm03igynhoc1.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=8aaa21aeb8dd306b0cd1bdcf799fecfa26df3066)

By filling in both the ""Royal Indigo & Jade Green"" Visa card with an average monthly expense pattern of $750 in the yellow cells, you end up with a Return of Investment of 32.52% on the $4000 dollars invested after 1 year. So, if CRO would hold the same price throughout the whole year, you will end up with a **risk-free profit of $1300 dollar** just by using the card and enjoying its benefits. The ROI is calculated on a one-year-basis + the calculated ROI will even be higher if you enjoy all benefits since I did not include Rewards+, Earn+, Expedia, AirBNB, Airport Lounge, Private Jet partnership, Welcome package, ... because of complexity reasons.

What do you guys think about such an offering and are there other offerings out there that I don't know about? Just trying to make informed decisions!

2024-03-14,15:13:01,cryptocurrency,Reminising from 2017,"I had heard about Bitcoin and the blockchain well before 2017, though only really started looking at it as an investment around August 2017. Bought in and got influenced by the hype of the time. 

Seeing Musk's comments about DOGE being used to buy Teslas (again) reminded me of John McAfee's ""Coin Of The Day/Week"". I sort of miss the excitement and anticipation of those shills to make a few bucks though after losing and making a bit, moved it all to BTC, ETH and kept ADA as something to move around if opportunities arose. No opportunities arose as the market moved to winter and I have just held and watched since.

2024-03-14,13:44:45,cryptocurrency,We could slowly see silent mass adoption of crypto,"Sending money via bank or purchasing stuff with credit card feels so fast, but in truth it is not. It consumes so much energy and time...you might see a transaction credited, but in real it is still in the works for days.

Crypto solves this problem. This is why payment companies such as PayPal, Mastercard, Visa...all of them are testing/ adopting crypto.

People who uses them, will be indirectly using crypto without knowing that.

Elon might allow people to buy his Tesla cars with DOGE. I think it is just PR, but it will get people's attention.
1 step to get retail back into crypto very soon.

Coinbase is rumored to become a bank on its own.

JP Morgan, the biggest bank in US, has its own blockchain, it's also uses Axelar (a blockchain) to experiment with transactions, wrapping assets.

It could be this cycle or the next, but mass adoption is coming. There is no way around it. Will it impact future prices? Me, as a crypto investor, am so excited.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-03-14,03:40:21,cryptocurrency,REQ will still be around years from now because it is something that 'normies' not into crypto can benefit from.,"When I look at most of these crypto startups, meme coins, etc... most of them require you to buy tokens, set up a wallet, go to an exchange, etc. **One thing that Apple has shown us, is that most people want simplicity.** Most people may dabble in Bitcoin/LTC/ETH at the most, but I still can't see everyday Joe-sick pack with a huge portfolio of coins.

The 1000's of coins that exist, is just too overwhelming for mainstream society. Who has time to research all of this? Satoshi's vision was to have a decentralized platform that anyone can use in the world, for very low fee's.

Unfortunately Bitcoin is no longer that, it's more of a store of wealth. REQ is simple, elegant, doesn't require you to go on exchanges or setup a wallet. You just send/accept a request, save money on fee's and all of the blockchain action is encapsulated from the end user. **Add in the fact that Request just announced that they are fiat friendly, which is a killer app for Request.** This is why I feel Request will still be around once most of these alt's come and go.

Not to mention their partners with Deloitte, PwC, acquisition of Consola, quikbooks integration, and much more. 

TL;DR - **I can see my Mom and Dad using Request to send money, buy things on Amazon, etc before I can see them setting up a wallet and buying cryptocurrencies on exchanges.** Unlike most alt's, Request has a very low barrier for entry.  It's something that serves the crypto community as well as the 'normies' (everyone else).

 There are millions of people interested in crypto and market cap is measured in Trillions of USD. So why don't we have coffee shops (as an example) all over the world where we can pay with Bitcoin as easily as Apple Pay? 

It just seems like a low-hanging fruit that would be good for everyone.

2024-03-08,20:45:04,cryptocurrency,QR coins since Apple news,"A couple weeks this news broke.   Since then projects with emphasis on quantum resistance (QR) continue to climb.  ALGO, QANX, CELL, and QRL are most often mentioned for preparing. 

Coin Bureau team had also been watching this as a narrative that could take hold this year.  They've shared a public video about what to watch for.

I sort of fell into learning about the Quantum Computing risk a few years ago after buying a QR coin. 

Over that time, I've concluded that businesses get it, and take it very seriously.  Case in point with Apple.  Also Google Chrome searches. 

Retail has been resistant to listen because of the impacts to btc/eth and other top projects.  It's usually met with ""quantum will never happen"" or ""it will be an easy upgrade"".  As we know, nothing is easy in a decentralized world from consensus, build, test, to roll out.  And since the initial weakness is with your signature, it will require time for users to migrate their holdings to a secure solution.

As you can imagine, I get BEAT UP with that message!  So why do I still hold?

Because if businesses get it, and are still trying to figure out how they can effectively use blockchain, I think they can grab some of that market. That really is qanplatform focus with multi-language smart contracts and hybrid chain, along with QR and evm compatibility. This includes being able to use existing evm wallets.

And I think this can be true for more than 1 quantum resistant project that is properly prepared.  If the narrative takes off with retail, I just view it as a big bonus.

In the end,  I'd keep an eye what is happening and do some research.  These coins definitely have a head start on this regardless of when you think the public will demand the risk is addressed.   ",AAPL,Apple
2024-03-08,04:27:17,cryptocurrency,slightly late yearly update for my nonprofit (cfthl) that was created entirely on/with reddit!," 

Hello!

I usually post around this time each year to update you all about my personal crypto project. About 5 years ago now, I began ""crypto for the homeless"" which was a for fun project I created to crowd fund crypto and to feed/provide some relief for the needy world-wide.

It was not meant to be a solution for homelessness, but more-so a proof of concept demonstrating that a single person could create scalable change for the homeless/needy and to perhaps inspire others to do the same.

onto the progress we've made:

Since inception, we have now been operating consistently for 5 years, added a good amount of members to the team, and improved/refined our entire operation many times.

We have official 501c3 status (nonprofit status)

We've had our website rebuilt into what it is today  and added as many social media accounts as we could comfortably manage (fb/twitter/x/ig/tiktok/youtube/reddit).

&#x200B;

So far, we've distributed close to 10,000 meals now (All HAND delivered to the homeless/needy directly) and every single one has been photographed/documented.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We are proud to say that we have worked with a lot of individual volunteers as well as official volunteer groups consistently over the years and continue to foster relationships with them to make this whole operation expand/scale up.

&#x200B;

Last year, my goal was to get some exposure through podcasts/videos/publications and succeeded. You can find us on apple music/spotify if you search for crypto for the homeless. In addition, we also got interviewed by 2 popular crypto website (AMB crypto and coin telegraph)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This year, my goal was to obtain sponsorship/relationships with other websites/developers to further enhance our operations/exposure.

&#x200B;

So far, we've received google nonprofit status, and link exchanged with various crypto websites. Also, the developer of a popular ios app - strongbox sponsored us!

&#x200B;

As 2024 rolls in, I can see that we have a pretty good sustainable operation that can continue to grow. I would like to focus on adding more team members for social media purposes.

&#x200B;

Thanks for everything, and it was only possible because of you! (reddit is where we began)",AAPL,Apple

2024-03-04,03:20:11,cryptocurrency,Deep Dive: What Dogecoin teaches us about human psychology,"**Introduction**

Hyatt Hotels, Toshiba, Fidelity, Wise and Booz Allen Hamilton are corporate titans in their [respective industry sectors](https://companiesmarketcap.com/page/12/). By offering services that touch the lives of many, whether in booking a hotel retreat or facilitating seamless travel, or delivering the latest cutting-edge gadget, all have gained the coveted status of a household name.

Yet the common connection they all share, is a market cap similar to a troll-coin designed to have no worth. [Currently priced at US $0.13](https://defidive.com/cryptocurrency/DOGE) (as of the time of writing on 29th February) after [a 57% rally this week](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT) and holding a market cap of US $19 billion is Dogecoin (ticker symbol DOGE). Unpretentiously and unapologetically ‚Äòselling‚Äô nothing but a bunch of warnings not to invest, I end up questioning the world we live in when nothing of tangible value seems to be attributed to the somewhat success of the project.¬†

[The current pump](https://preview.redd.it/jl0tllgf68mc1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac5ae66ed0ca3d6a6f6a46821a052638b26fbbe0)

Dogecoin underscores the evolving dynamics within the cryptocurrency landscape, challenging conventional notions of value and market influence. In this article we explore how a bunch of do-good social sentiments and an unlikely series of events culminated in Dogecoin becoming a prominent feature in modern internet culture. And curiously‚Ä¶ how it can be valued as much as it is.Dogecoin, born out of the internet culture's love for memes and the desire to create a fun and friendly cryptocurrency, has emerged as a distinctive player in the world of digital assets.

Dogecoin was started in 2013 by Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus, who [initially created](https://dogecoin.com/dogepedia/articles/history-of-dogecoin/) it as a joke based on [a cute Shiba Inu dog with poor grammar.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge) Aptly thinking that the cryptocurrency industry was being taken far too seriously, they took a copy of Litecoin‚Äôs code (developers known this as ‚Äòforking‚Äô), removed the maximum coin minting limit and changed some of the code‚Äôs variables to ensure that the coin‚Äôs supply was so generous that it would be worth fractions of a cent. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin keeps making more with billions of coins entering circulation each year. This feature has sparked debate within the crypto community giving rise to questions and discussions about the project's long-term viability. Critics argue that a generous coin supply may pose challenges to establishing and maintaining a robust and enduring economic framework for the token.

In science, we use the word antithesis to describe the difference between two ideals or mindsets. In its design proposition stands an antithesis to conventional wisdom in a combination of factors that really should not work. Yet in its viral launch, it quickly gained traction surpassing Bitcoin‚Äôs transaction volume in two weeks and becoming Reddit‚Äôs tipping currency of choice.

Before venturing into the cryptocurrency industry, my professional experience was in investment banking. There, the common tools for analyzing a company, is a slew of corporate jargon with terms such as balance sheets, liabilities and net asset values. Those on the trading floor went by a vocabulary of fixed income returns, black-scholes and fundamental analysis. All elaborate methods that might seem like ways to justify hefty paychecks, all of which fall flat when applied to Dogecoin.

We might be tempted to think that a business or finance major would be better suited to exploring the themes of Dogecoin price action. However I saw an opportunity to explore a passion of mine, a deep dive into social psychology and behavioral economics to draw a conclusion into the irrationality of Dogecoin‚Äôs price action.

The coin's journey evolved in an unexpected rise when high-profile endorsements, particularly from figures like Elon Musk, pushed Dogecoin into the mainstream. Musk's tweets became a catalyst for Dogecoin price movements.

**The Elon effect on Dogecoin‚Äôs price**

If you think about Dogecoin, you will think of Musk. The billionaire really loves the coin and every time he tweets about it, the price goes up. With [174 million](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) X (Twitter) followers, his ability to significantly swing the markets is uncanny and has, at times, gotten him into a lot of trouble.

On February 4th 2021, he posted several tweets of Dogecoin, sending the price flying over [40% within the day](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT).

**The Concept of Behavioral Finance**

Behavioral finance and behavioral economics examine how psychological factors and emotional biases influence financial decisions and market outcomes. While in the presence of well-spoken finance folks, ones we might find at our friendly neighborhood bank branch, we‚Äôre told that markets are rational. And so it might not make immediate sense that in reality, markets, however justified, are still run by their ultimate decision makers, human beings. In the spirit of mental health awareness, we have to be brutally honest with ourselves that we are just as fallible to the forces of human nature then the next. In the case of Dogecoin and Musk's tweets, there is some interesting psychology at play:

**Herding Behavior / Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)**

Whether we like to admit it or not, we are social creatures that often follow the crowd and are influenced by the actions of others. In the context of Dogecoin, Musk‚Äôs fanboying about the meme to his large following creates a desire for others, often sharing real time about their purchases to follow the herd.

**Anchoring**

Anchoring occurs when individuals fixate on specific prices or values, often the first one they encounter. Musk's tweets can serve as anchors, setting a reference point for investors and influencing their perceptions of a coin's value. We see this at play when follow-up comments are posted in response to Musk‚Äôs original Dogecoin related tweets.

**Overreaction (and Underreaction) / Celebrity Endorsement**

Behavioral finance suggests that markets can overreact or underreact to new information. Musk's tweets, especially because they are so unexpected and due to his influence, trigger exaggerated market responses, causing rapid price movements. In 2018, SEC charged Musk with securities fraud drawing conclusion that a tweet in what some thought was a joke of taking Tesla private at $420, caused the stock to jump 6% triggering the stock exchange‚Äôs emergency circuit breaker which temporarily halted trading. [The SEC](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-219) at the time quoted its Enforcement officer Steven Peikin in a statement sharing that ‚ÄúAn officer‚Äôs celebrity status or reputation as a technological innovator does not give license to take those responsibilities lightly.‚Äù

**Human Bias**

[Confirmation bias is recognised in psychology](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-confirmation-bias) as a human tendency to favor information that confirms pre-existing beliefs and values. [Scientists like Daniel Khaneman in the field of behavioral economics](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timmaurer/2021/06/13/the-joy-of-being-wrong-and-the-danger-of-desirability-bias/?sh=3dc619fd56ac) often explore ways to mitigate the effects of confirmation bias, as it can lead to flawed reasoning, reinforce existing beliefs, and contribute to the persistence of stereotypes. Musk‚Äôs tweets, often shared by Dogecoin enthusiasts, serve to reinforce positive views and affirm prior decisions.

[Nassim Taleb, author of ‚ÄúThe Black Swan‚Äù](https://xn--nassim%20taleb,%20author%20of%20the%20black%20swan,-ls75abc/), another pioneer in the field of behavioral economics explains that humans have a tendency to use recent experience as a baseline for what will happen in the future. A frequent reminder provided by Musk by his repetitive sharing of Doge related content helps remind you that we should all be holding Dogecoin.

Algorithms increasingly dictate our perspective of the world with a phenomenon emerging in recent years known as a ‚Äúfilter bubble‚Äù. [Eli Pariser, activist and author](https://books.google.com.my/books/about/The_Filter_Bubble.html?id=Qn2ZnjzCE3gC&redir_esc=y) first popularised this concept and explains how modern technology, from search engines to social media platforms are designed in a way whereby our past interests will determine what we are exposed to in the future. ¬†The result is an algorithmic bias for images and content following the themes of our favorite meme.

**And further‚Ä¶**

While these are the core tenets of behavioral finance, understanding the complexities of human behavior can lead us to observe that studying political theory would provide snippets of rationale behind those banding behind Musk‚Äôs Dogecoin tweets. Observed in this context as a way to share anti-establishment and financial libertarian ideals, he becomes a convenient spokesperson whose tweets are easily liked and shared among our peers.

**What‚Äôs Next?**

Dogecoin developers [announced that a physical dogecoin token could reach Earth‚Äôs moon on 23rd December 2023](https://twitter.com/dogecoin/status/1725057264640204962) in a space payload mission planned by Pittsburg-based firm Astrobotic. This mission is in addition to the launch of ‚ÄòDOGE-1‚Äô satellite which was initially set for 2022 and now targeted for later in 2024.

As this is a huge step forward for Dogecoin, the crypto community is anticipating a tweet from Musk about this moon mission, which will propel the price of Dogecoin to new heights.¬†

&#x200B;

[To the moon!](https://preview.redd.it/6gdmk99h78mc1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c6af8ddc5f46d76bbe6eb848ff80e02a44a4144)

**Conclusion**

In crypto, psychology and behavioral finance matter just as much as fundamentals. Despite Dogecoin‚Äôs origin as a joke, the substantial impact of Musk's influence and the vibrant community surrounding this dog-themed cryptocurrency significantly shapes its market dynamics.

Beyond the meme-driven hype, Dogecoin has found practical use cases. The coin is increasingly embraced for tipping and charitable donations due to its low transaction fees. Additionally, the upcoming launch of a physical Dogecoin token to the moon and the 'DOGE-1' satellite project showcase the coin's potential utility in space-related missions.

We live in a world where significant value is attributed to social sentiments, but never before have we lived in a world where it has been measurable, real-time. Interesting social experiment to gauge the value of mutual good, driven and combined with capitalism‚Äôs finest motivators. To get rich.

A solid investment thesis is typically characterized by seeking out projects with strong fundamentals, but when the fundamentals are entirely meme-driven‚Ä¶ knowing that the markets are driven by cycles of human psychology, we must admit, do we need to challenge conventional wisdom? Are the current generations of gamers and online digital-natives and (those who grew up not knowing life-before) social media, all reaching their 30‚Äôs‚Ä¶ in positions of power, controlling more financial capability than ever before, rising to become decision makers in this world. Meme‚Äôs and the hilarity behind sharing them are second nature to those, both young and old‚Ä¶ are we finally starting to understand the power each of us yield in our smartphones. And are we now pricing that into fundamentals alongside revenues, assets and liabilities.

**What you should know.**

* The board size scales based off screen size, this means playing on an Iphone SE can feel a bit challenging due to the small size of the assets. Whereas playing on a mobile device with a larger screen or tablet - allows for a lot more aesthetic enjoyment.
* Since the card information is hidden by default, and most of the card itself is hidden in your hand - it feels like this layout would be challenging for beginners without starting knowledge. Of course cards can be tapped to pull up more information but it just feels like it isn't exactly beginner friendly.

What do I think:

* The Mobile App works great as an on the road extension of the Gods Unchained Client, and I'll definitely be playing it when I'm waiting somewhere not at home. However losing a ranked game due to a bug (like an unplayed card disappearing from your hand and still taking up a card slot) can be infuriating.

The app has potential but needs to be further developed before it can become a smashing success. I hope you enjoyed this quick post/review of the newly launched GU mobile app.

2024-02-29,16:57:13,cryptocurrency,You're not nearly as bullish as you should be on the Bitcoin ETF,"We've quite quickly seen the effect of these etf's on liquidity and price but this is only the start, many are aware that asset allocators will be unlocked over the following months giving us tremendous tailwinds but I think, more importantly, is how many etf's Bitcoin&crypto could be added to. 

There are 458 different etf's holding apple stock. 458! Think about that, thats 458 different products that have to buy apple stock on the spot whenever someone invests in the fund. Why so many? Because they have different goal's and prospectives. VGT holds 77m shares because they are a fund that invests in a basket of information technology stocks, MGK holds 13m shares because they invest in all mega cap growth stocks, VTI holds 463m shares because they invest in the total stock market, on and on 455 more times! 

Yes the btc etf's are crushing it as is but imagine the entire new market that could be created over the coming decades (or even quicker if Gary gets tossed) imagine,

* Bitcoin/Ethereum for some diversified gains
* Bitcoin/Gold for inflation protection
* Bitcoin with high growth tech for people with high risk tolerance looking for upside
* I would personally invest today in a basket of the top 10 cryptos if it was available in a tax advantaged account

I could go on with another 450+ ideas but you get the point. Each one of these products would be forced to buy up any liquidity at any price; you are not bullish enough. Any etf baskets you'd like to see?

If you haven‚Äôt read *The Bitcoin Standard*, you may be surprised to learn that it‚Äôs not primarily about Bitcoin. It‚Äôs primarily about something which has been closely associated with Bitcoin from the beginning, namely, *the importance of sound money*. With that said, I won‚Äôt be diving into its primary subject matter straight away. I‚Äôll take up the question of why sound money is important in my second post. Here I‚Äôm going to focus on an equally important, logically prior question: *what is money*? I‚Äôm going to explain why this question has the power to change the world.

Ammous has a lot to say about money, but one of the most important themes of *The Bitcoin Standard* is that, whatever else money is, it‚Äôs something with respect to which people should have substantial freedom of choice. Since genuine freedom of choice requires genuine availability of options, Ammous‚Äô attitude is also strongly *laissez faire* ‚Äì i.e., let the competition begin, and may the best money win. Despite his strong belief in monetary freedom of choice, Ammous never explicitly advocates for what seems to me like an obvious concomitant: that people have a *basic right* to choose what form of money they transact in.

I‚Äôm going to return to this idea ‚Äì that we have a right to choose which type or form of money we use ‚Äì shortly when I propose my own answer to the question of what money is. But first I need to address an obvious complication, which is that belief in monetary freedom of choice goes strongly against the grain of most modern thinking. Politicians and policymakers around the world implicitly assume that, whatever else money is, it‚Äôs something which *they* ought to control.

For ease of discussion, it will help to coin some terms for two opposing schools of thought. Let‚Äôs say that anyone who believes that people have a right to choose what form of money they use is a *monetary libertarian*. Ammous is very likely a monetary libertarian, even if he never quite says so. At the opposite end of the spectrum are those who deny that any such right exists. These are the *monetary authoritarians*. They would say that a nation‚Äôs currency ought to be mandated by its government and overseen by a central authority (e.g., a central bank) whose primary job is to set monetary policy.

Much of *The Bitcoin Standard* serves as an indictment of monetary authoritarianism. Ammous‚Äô main line of criticism can be summed up in the assertion that monetary authoritarianism has a proven history of eventuating in unmitigated fiscal fusterclucks (e.g., ruinous inflation, boom and bust cycles, defaulting on the national debt, and so on). Although this line of argument has a lot going for it, it also faces one very serious obstacle, which is that true believers will respond that monetary authoritarianism has only ever failed because the wrong people were in charge. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get it right this time,‚Äù the perennial defenders of various *isms* always say, ‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôre better and smarter.‚Äù

The true believer‚Äôs unshakable faith in the benevolence and wisdom of centralized authority is what brings us to my main goal for this post, which is to suggest an alternative strategy for tearing down the structures of monetary authoritarianism. This is also where we circle back to the question which I motivated in an admittedly melodramatic fashion at the outset. For once we have a proper understanding of *what money is*, we‚Äôll see that people do in fact have a fundamental right to choose their money, a right which precludes the hope that politicians and policymakers will finally ‚Äúget it right this time‚Äù.

If you pick up any introductory textbook on economics or a related field, you‚Äôre bound to come across a discussion of the three basic ‚Äúfunctions‚Äù of money ‚Äì Ammous even rehearses them in the first chapter of *The Bitcoin Standard*. This is a very standard way of explaining what money is. But the three basic functions are clearly pointing to something deeper about the fundamental nature of money, which is that *money is a tool for solving economic problems*.

Many of the problems that money solves are economically fundamental in that solving them is what separates primitive economies from more advanced economies. Instead of using money, primitive economies use the barter system wherein goods are exchanged directly for other goods. The barter system only works on a very small scale and, for this reason, our most fundamental economic problems are also among the most fundamental problems pertaining to the human condition. Simply put, it‚Äôs much harder to sustain a growing population on a primitive economy. By allowing humanity to advance in ways that would otherwise be impossible, money solves problems which are endemic to the human condition.

Cutting to the chase, the first main claim I want to make concerns the fundamental nature of money:

*(M1) Money is a tool for solving humanity‚Äôs most fundamental economic problems, many of which are problems endemic to the human condition*.

One basic economic problem is that ‚Äúwants‚Äù do not always coincide. Here‚Äôs a concrete illustration. Suppose the cobbler wants some apples but that the apple farmer doesn‚Äôt need shoes. In that case, the cobbler will have to arrange a series of trades in order to acquire whatever it is that the apple farmer wants. If the cobbler is lucky, the series of trades will be short. It‚Äôs possible the apple farmer wants oranges and the orange farmer happens to need new shoes. But experience teaches that things are rarely ever that simple.

Money solves the cobbler‚Äôs problem by serving as a *medium of exchange* which everyone will accept. Instead of arranging a complex series of trades, the cobbler just sells his shoes and uses the cash to buy some apples. In this way, money greatly simplifies the process of economic exchange, which frees people up to spend less time making trades and more time producing economic goods.

Here are a few more problems that money solves. Suppose the apple farmer wants a new house. One immediate problem is that it will be very difficult to store up a house‚Äôs worth of apples. Even if he somehow manages it, another problem is that the apples will rot long before they can be consumed. Money, however, presumably doesn‚Äôt rot. This makes it a much better *store of value*, another of the three basic functions. Instead of trying to save up a mountain of apples, the apple farmer can save up the money he gets from selling his crops. In addition to being a medium of exchange and a store of value, money also functions as a *unit of account*. Altogether, these constitute the three basic functions of money.

My proposal, then, is that money is ultimately a tool for solving humanity‚Äôs most fundamental economic problems. Given that many textbooks already say more or less the same thing, this suggestion shouldn't be too controversial. What will be much more controversial is my claim about the implications for monetary freedom of choice:

*(M2) If money is a tool for solving humanity‚Äôs most fundamental economic problems, many of which are endemic to the human condition, then people have a right to choose the form or type of money that best solves those problems.*

Money is an incredibly powerful economic tool. It is in many ways a prerequisite for the advancement of human civilization. Yet it can only work its magic through those who use it. Monetary authoritarians the world over think of money as just another tool which governments use to manage the lives of their citizens. What they fail to comprehend is that *we* are the ones who collectively imbue currencies with their transformative power. Money is not a gift which governments graciously bestow upon their subjects. It is a tool empowered by those who use it, the ones who need it to solve their basic economic problems.

Since we are both the source of its power and the end which it serves, we should have the freedom to put our collective agency behind the money of our choosing. We should have the freedom to choose the money that best solves the problems that our money is supposed to solve, namely, *our* problems.

And if that money happens to be Bitcoin, then we should have the freedom to choose Bitcoin.",AAPL,Apple

2024-02-25,16:51:20,cryptocurrency,Apple adds PQ3 quantum-resistant encryption to iMessage,"By now you've likely noticed that top companies are already implementing encryption that is prepared for quantum computing. 

These updates are needed for digital signatures that currently protect your keys.

Apple is doing this to protect your iMessage- I think we should have at least that same security for our crypto assets!

Typically, someone will say if quantum can hack your wallet,  everything will be vulnerable.   

And that's right- which is why Apple and Google and Governments and Military and Banks and everyone else are preparing or already implementing solutions.  We are sleeping at the wheel. 

We can't just sit back and say this will be quickly and easily fixed when the time comes.   If crypto isn't prepared like everyone else,  it will be an easy target.  To gain consensus,  build, and  test we likely will need years.   Plus we need to give people time to transition assets to a new set of keys that aren't vulnerable.  I'm not sure what we'll do with old wallets from the Satoshi days.   There is a lot of btc sitting there,  and many have even older encryption that is vulnerable even if they never transacted. 

When we do try to transition, asking users to adopt wallets they don't know will not go well. 

I would like to see top coins implement a cross signing model like Qanplatform has built.  

This will allow users to continue using evm wallets they know and trust.  That will limit disruption and allow us to continue using the ecosystem that's been developed. 

To create wider adoption, cryptocurrency should be leading this effort for secure digital assets.  And it needs to start now.   There are too many advancements in quantum computing and more efficient algos to ignore.

Of course, many of its regular shills and fan boys came to support it, but I noticed something curious days after I posted it, and long after it fell out of any rankings here in this sub-Reddit.

The paid shills and possibly bots were leaving long drawn out defenses for their beloved Cardano, which I thought was strange, because they must have been actively searching for posts like these in order to defend their beloved Ada coin.

You can check my history if you'd like to see what I am referring to, but my point is, the last time this was a thing was the lead up to, and during the last bull run of 2021, so it may be a good sign that the bull might come early this time around... well this and the fact that Bitcoin and Ethereum are approaching all-time highs again, which we all know is when profits are taken, and then put into the alts, kicking off that sweet sweet alt rally and all the gains that will come from it!

Nvidia may set it off early too, because depending on earnings today, all the just in it for the gains folks might sell, and they'll all need a new place to park their money for to earn 100% plus gains this year, and we all know that's got the cryptocurrency market written all over it.

This has been reported by many people, but the app is still in the appstore.  The problem is the Real Rabby Wallet ([https://rabby.io)](https://rabby.io)/) has an app under review by apple, so this scammer's approved AppStore App called ""Rabby Wallet & Crypto Solution"" is tricking people into thinking it is the genuine one, they enter they seed phrase or private key, and moments later all of their life savings, crypto belongings are GONE!

What is very concerning is how a closed ecosystem like Apple Appstore would allow blatant use of the real logo, impersonating the real wallet, causing to huge amount of funds lost (I have seen well over $100k stolen already from the Rabby Discord) 

Apple needs to take down this application and help those users, it has been up for 4 days, with many reports and reviews submitted (by myself and others)

2024-02-12,13:57:49,cryptocurrency,Safemoon ‚Äúarmy‚Äù cheer charged fraudster John Karony‚Äôs release on bail,"Quick summary, Karony‚Äôs bail was denied three times but his lawyers finally managed to get him released on a $3,000,000 bail package, which includes internet and device monitoring and he‚Äôs to stay at his parents house.  

The judge found that package to be sufficient, whilst the Government argued that Karony is a continued threat to investors due to his ability to have potential access to tens of millions of dollars that the Government would find difficult to trace at this point in time.  

John was released at the end of last week back to Utah, where he is now awaiting trial.  

However, you‚Äôd think he was cleared of all charges and Elon Musk was planning to accept Safemoon for Tesla purchases with the way the indefinitely mentally feeble remaining members of the Safemoon Army celebrate.  

With their gushing well wishes and pledges for support, I have a hard time determining whether it‚Äôs more funny or more pathetic. Let‚Äôs wrap up why:  

John, and his cohorts Kyle and Thomas have provably removed almost $300m from Safemoon liquidity pools, either selling removed liquidity for USDT to Bitmart, or off ramping thousands of BNB to wash trade them and cash millions of dollars out.  

Safemoon LLC filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy - full liquidation, and last week all the LP assets were removed.  

Safemoon token contract has been paused, which means it is impossible to buy, sell, transfer or swap the token.  


So there is no company, no developers, no liquidity and you can‚Äôt use the token.  

And yet these people cheer, even though a simple 5 minutes spent on BSCscan and public property purchase records show the immense amount of fraud executed by Safemoon CEO.  


It really boggles the mind. I used to wonder how cult mass suicides happen. What would drive people to line up to drink poison?!  

Now I know.

2024-02-09,07:27:02,cryptocurrency,Is Plutus imploding?,"This probably sounds a bit like a FUD-ey post, but I'm honestly just frustrated with what's going on at Plutus and wanted to post it here to see if others feel similar. 

Plutus is a ""crypto card"" (or was) that gives you an attractive cashback rate depending on how much PLU you have, and ""perks"" that are rebated, for example, Spotify/Netflix/Apple One/etc.

Plutus has been going slowly downhill for a while with sudden changes more frequent than a kid with ADHD, constant delays to announced features like Apple Pay / Google Pay / DEX, and general incompetence on how to run a financial product. I'm wondering if they're about to implode.

**Recent changes:**

**'temporary' deactivation of the DEX**

The DEX was a system inside Plutus that allows you to sell PLU or ETH tokens directly, for example, to charge your card with it. That got 'temporarily' disabled, and the date to re-enable kept getting pushed and pushed. This means the only way to sell the PLU cashback you get is to cash it out to a third-party wallet (by paying ‚Ç¨7.50), transfer it to an exchange, and sell it.

Reduced DEX fees are a advertised benefit according to their CURRENT plan tiers, even though the DEX is not usable. The blog post that announced pausing the DEX was published in February 2022, almost an entire year ago: https://medium.com/plutus/important-update-plutusdex-paused-eea-99f8d2747723

If they were to revamp the DEX, why not leave the old system up until the new one is ready? To me, this feels like an artificial halting of selling of PLU to keep the price up.

**Disabling of fiat withdraw/send**

Plutus wanted to be a bank-like app, so you get an IBAN and you can send money in that you can use on your card. A couple of weeks ago, withdrawing of fiat got disabled with the explanation that they need to increase security. No timeline was given on when it will be available again.

So to summarize this: Plutus now is a bank-like app that allows you to send money in, but not send money out. The only way to get money out is to spend it on the card, and you can't top up Revolut, for example.

I just checked my emails to see if I got anything that tells me this, but nothing. So if I didn't try to withdraw I probably wouldn't even know. 

(Today another change hit: you can no longer send money in from accounts that aren't in your name. A few fintech apps have similar restrictions so not big deal, but considering they want to be bank-like, I wanted to mention it...)


**Just owning PLU is no longer enough to get cashback/perks, you have to subscribe to a monthly plan with cash**

After a couple of different announcements of changes, it looks like Plutus settled on this: In order to get any cashback whatsoever, either through purchases or perks, you have to subscribe to one of the 3 available plans.

Even if you bought a ton of PLU previously to unlock one of the staking tiers that give you more perks, in order to now get the same cashback from those perks, you need to subscribe independently of stacking level with cash, effectively breaking the original agreement made when users bought those PLU tokens. Also interesting here is that there is no mechanism to use PLU directly to pay for subscriptions. 

**Lots of obstacles you have to jump through to withdraw PLU**

Turning PLU into cash is getting harder and harder. After getting cashback, the PLU is frozen for 45 days until you can do anything with it. To withdraw (after waiting 45 days) you have to connect a third-party wallet (like Metamask) and then pay a ‚Ç¨7.50 withdrawal fee.

Also, the minimum withdrawal limit is ‚Ç¨50, so if your cashback is under ‚Ç¨50, you can't withdraw it at all. There is also no longer a way to directly use PLU to charge the card (or pay for subscriptions), so Plutus is now a debit card that gives you crypto, but can't use crypto.


**Introduction of spending limits to get cashback**

Together with the new plans, we got tighter spending limits. To increase the spending limit, you have to ""Redeem PLU"" (aka burning it).

The lowest plan, ""Starter"", now has a limit of ‚Ç¨250, so additional purchases after you hit this limit will not give you any rewards. This is the purchase amount, not the cashback amount. 

It's obvious that this is an attempt to put 'utility' into the PLU token and reduce emission, but the incremental changes make the system harder and harder to understand, forcing people to create spreadsheets.

**Constant delays to everything, and blaming others (like Visa) for it**

Constant delays to announcements since the card migration to Modulr (more on that later). Apple Pay / Google Pay got delayed so often that ""Soon TM"" is now a meme over at /r/Plutus.

There are constant claims that it's in 'beta' and the reason why it's not live yet is because Visa found some issues with tokenization or something like that and they're working with them. Uhmmm sure, Plutus is working directly with Visa, and not their issuer (Modulr), and Visa of all companies has problems with enabling Apple Pay.... ? eg https://np.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/1ae4lxe/google_apple_pay/

**Botched card migration, lack of physical card, and recommending Curve as a solution**

Plutus switched from Solaris to Modulr at the end of last year. Instead of having both in parallel and fading out Solaris, the migration happened extremely close to each other, with some people not having their virtual Modulr card until days before the Solaris one stops working.

Notably, the new card had no physical version which was coming ""soon"" but got delayed a couple of times until the first cards finally arrived like... last week? The new physical card also costs ‚Ç¨10 to issue, even if you had the previous Solaris one.

So, a company that gives you cashback on purchases, and rebates on things like supermarkets (physical) no longer had a physical card, or any other means to use the service in physical stores due to lack of Apple/Google Pay. The official 'solution' from Plutus was to 'just use Curve', a third-party card provider that proxies other cards.

**Introduction of 'ambassadors'**

Sometime last year, Plutus started paying ""ambassadors"" to support their public image. Ambassadors have to rate Plutus with 5 stars and almost every post on /r/Plutus gets lots of ""Very cool!!!"", ""So nice!!!"", ""Again, great progress from Plutus. Can't wait to see what comes next"" comments that make it sound like the sub is full of bots and hides actual sentiment. They'll be on this post as well.

**tl;dr - general incompetence or signs of implosion?**

A lot of these things, like changes to plans or cards, weren't properly communicated outside of Reddit/Twitter. Occasionally, an email comes in but it doesn't make it clear what's actually going on. Without following on Reddit, I would have missed most of it and probably started wondering why I'm no longer getting cashback.

Even while writing this post, I wanted to check their official website for some of these new systems but had to fall back to Google to find the relevant help pages.

I don't know if Plutus is just this bad at communicating, or if these are attempts to purposely hide information. 

The recent changes to tiers and plans tell me that the company may be in financial trouble and probably realized that just giving tokens to people without any utility is not enough to keep the organization going, now trying to figure out how to do business without a clear plan forward.

**Concerning things around the company:**

- Inability to provide proper timelines for their financial product, or handle important migrations (like card issuer) smoothly 
- Constant delays to promised features (Apple/Google Pay/DEX)
- Disabling of basic financial functions like withdrawing of fiat (and since today also depositing from accounts that are not in one's name)
- Sudden introduction of changes and then reverting those changes, lack of communication for people that aren't on Reddit/Twitter all the time 

**Concerning things around the PLU token:**

- Obstacles added to withdraw and sell PLU like disabling of the DEX without an alternative, 45 days lockup, or 7.5 Euro withdrawal fee feel like artificial halting of PLU selling
- Introduction of caps, changing of existing agreements (like stacking of PLU) by trying to force users (that may have bought a lot of PLU that has since lost value) into monthly subscriptions or lose their benefits
- Attempts at adding 'tokenomics' aka burning PLU to raise spending limits that didn't exist previously (aka adding a restriction and then a way to remove that new restriction)

Even with a monthly sub, it's still pretty simple to make up for it with enough perks so it's not too bad, but Plutus doesn't feel great currently and I'm not sure I want to trust them with my cash.

Later, in June 2022, the company sold a substantial portion of its remaining Bitcoins, totaling nearly 30,000, citing reasons related to Bitcoin's liquidity and bolstering its cash reserves. However, these sales proved ill-timed as Bitcoin surged in 2023, appreciating by nearly 150%, potentially costing Tesla an estimated $500 million in unrealized gains. Currently, Tesla holds approximately 9,720 Bitcoins, valued at around $400 million, and the company's future actions regarding these holdings remain a subject of speculation, depending on Bitcoin's performance in 2024 and Tesla's financial outlook.

2024-01-20,18:53:11,cryptocurrency,Which Crypto project has the best chance of powering The Metaverse in the near future IF Apple were to feature one for its launch of the Apple Vision Pro that's being released Feb 2?,"Would love to see your opinions and some discussion on this.

The Apple Vision Pro launches in 2 weeks and I wouldn't put it past Apple to launch with the establishment of its Metaverse. The Metaverse would have to be something that is supported by a product that is already in development imo. Would their metaverse have to be powered by a crypto project, or could they have some private and proprietary? 

I haven't done much research into these yet, but I figured coming to this subreddit would be a good place to start. (I am familiar with Reddit, so I could be mistaken there lol).

Anyways, what are your opinions on who is best suited for this?

Some that I've seen mentioned...

$MANA  
$ROOT  
$SAND  
$RNDR

Appreciate and welcome any discussion here. I think there is a lot of money to be made here. Even for gas tokens. Cheers",AAPL,Apple
2024-01-19,15:54:56,cryptocurrency,Good ETFs to short cryptocurrency,"Not sure about Etereum ETFs to short. If anyone knows any let me know.

&#x200B;

BITO is the only one I know that is predictable. You can short XBTF on Fidelity as well but the movements are really strange. GBTC does not let you short, and so far none of the new spot ETFs allow trading on margin that I know of.

Didn't know if anyone else knew good ETFs to short for crypto in general.

&#x200B;

I presume TSLA and ARKK are kind of also implied go-tos but they are not 100% crypto related, though they have enough investments in crypto that crypto could impact the stock / ETF prices. 

&#x200B;

BITO has been my go-to but yesterday and the day before there were no shares available to short. Today it looks like over 1 million shares have been released for shorting - but in the future would be nice to have a backup plan for these huge chart rejection points i.e. 48k for the king, 2.5k for Ether... etc.",TSLA,Tesla
2024-01-19,03:02:21,cryptocurrency,A wallet with Apple Pay-like transactions that rounds up to the nearest dollar and auto invests the difference into a pre-selected crypto portfolio.,"I‚Äôm curious if this already exists. 

Could only really work on a chain with tiny fees. Or maybe it makes the investment periodically to allow enough to accumulate so all your investments aren‚Äôt lost to fees. 

Basically what the title says. 

You buy coffee for 4.65. The wallet rounds up and puts 35 cents automatically into a crypto portfolio or some stupid high risk meme coin of your choice. 

Basically it all goes to 0 and you couldn‚Äôt care less, or you some how manage to make 1000. 

Maybe it links directly with Apple Pay so you don‚Äôt have to use something you aren‚Äôt already using although maybe there‚Äôs a security concern there. 

Would be great if the wallet had pre-made portfolios from other people you can select so there‚Äôs a community component - would also significantly reduce the friction for new crypto people who couldn‚Äôt care less about creating their own portfolio and instead just pick one so their wallet can auto invest into it. 

Is this already out there? 

If not, why couldn‚Äôt it work?",AAPL,Apple

2024-01-15,07:18:52,cryptocurrency,The year 2023 in Bitcoin Cash,"From Mr-Zwets' article on read dot cash

___________________________

Buckle up, 2023 was quite the ride!

#CashTokens Toolchain

Bitcoin Cash ended 2022 with the CashTokens lock-in date on November 15th, when the proposed upgrades (CHIPs) got accepted and activated on chipnet: the testnet to stage BCH network upgrades. To actually start developing with the new CashTokens features, a whole tool-chain had to get extended first, and that's what happened over the coming months.

This effort to upgrade the toolchain started at the end of 2022 with Libauth, the low level speed-focused Jasvascript library developed by Jason Drayzehener (the CashTokens author), which introduced CashTokens support to the alpha version. Next, in december '22 still , the Fulcrum indexers released a new version which supported serving CashTokens information and alongside the mainnet-js library got upgraded by Pat and released as v1.0 with CashTokens support. With some of the core pieces ready for CashTokens development on Chipnet, this brought us to the start of 2023.

#CashTokens on Chipnet

2023 started with people utilizing these tools to start prototyping new applications! Early January I (Mathieu G.) was the first person to take advantage of these new tools to publicly start developing a minimum-viable CashTokens wallet, and was doing so very publicly in an attempt to garner interest from other developers. Alongside the wallet the first CashTokens explorer was also in development. It is exciting to truly pioneer innovation, that's also how it felt playing around with the BCMR metadata-standard to actually add a name and an icon to the CashTokens on Chipnet!

#Community Learning

Alongside the development of the toolchain and first basic applications, there was also a lot of community learning going on. Discussions about how CashTokens compared to other token systems, like SLP and ERC20, and discussions about how BCH's smart contract capabilities now compare to those of Ethereum. The toolchain got further upgraded by ChainGraph adding support for CashTokens. This was a super important addition as Chaingraph allows to make complex queries for example, to get all the addresses holding a certain CashToken.
Let the Countdown Begin!

Mid-February, in a much awaited move, Coin.dance added a countdown to the Bitcoin Cash page counting from 90days down towards the CashTokens upgrade! In the meanwhile I kept working on the CashTokens wallet to enable easy token-creation, which allowed non-devs to also get involved on chipnet!

#Flipstarter Funding the Ecosystem

With the upgrade coming closer there was the clear need for a CashTokens explorer with BCMR metadata support, luckily Salem Kode took the initiative launching a crowd funder and got the support to successfully fund-raise the project. Rosco and I also finished the work on upgrading CashScript for CashTokens, releasing a beta version, 2 months in advance of the actual activation date which represent the final piece in the tool-chain to being able to build smart contract applications! Along side this, the flipstarter for continued development on mainnet-js also got funded to for continued maintenance & development. Electron Cash also launched and successfully funded a flipstarter to add CashTokens support to the desktop wallet.

#DeFi on BCH

Although CashTokens took much of the spotlight, consistent improvement were also made to BCH Bull, the in-house platform by General Protocols for AnyHedge smart contracts. In February General protocols announced that over 43,000 BCH got locked in AnyHedge smart contracts since October 2022. Another milestone for the protocol was reached in March with a listing an the DeFi metric site 'DeFi Lama'. AnyHedge now had over $1,200,000 TVL that same month, according to DeFi Lama.

Then mid-april BCH BULL had its production release introducing ""2x the contract size, 3x the contract duration, approx 30% cheaper fees, additional asset (CNY), premium tracker and language localization!"" according to the announcement.

#First CashTokens Apps in Development

The push for CashTokens infrastructure and tooling was sorely needed, however with this focus on tooling some people were worried about the lack of announcement for big projects building on top of CashTokens. A first sign of a big CashTokens project in the works came with Paytaca's demo mid-April showcasing connecting the Paytaca wallet to participate in a CashTokens NFT minting contract to mint 'cat' NFTs.

These announcements stayed out until May 1st with the announcement of the BCH Guru project, a collectible NFT project on CashTokens planning to make a price prediction app. The Guru project was an important part in building anticipation for the CashTokens network upgrade with their announcement song and countdown to the upgrade.

Together with the announcements of the first CashTokens projects there was also a big increase in the information, content and marketing around CashTokens. The BCH Podcast hosted by Jeremy, was incredibly consistent with having guests on to talk about the upcoming upgrade and everything else happening in the crypto-scene, for example the BRC-20 drama of how fungible tokens using the ordinals protocol were added to Bitcoin. This also served as a great way to contrast what BTC was doing versus what BCH was focusing on.

The day before the mainnet launch of CashTokens, Electrum Cash released a beta version with CashTokens support in anticipation of the mainnet activation! The Paytaca team also released an update to their browser extension wallet adding the capability to receive CashTokens and added 'PaytacaConnect' which allows the extension to interact with smart contract web applications (dapps).

#Activation Day

Community marketing efforts had been ramping up with podcast episodes, countdowns, a few high profile articles and a celebration upgrade stream on twitch! Development efforts had been ramping up too, to get the 3 different wallets compatible with CashTokens and ready for mainnet. The CashTokens activation day went without any issue on the protocol level. There were some hiccups on the application side, Cashonize, using mainnet-js, was not properly displaying tokens for mainnet which lead to some emergency debugging.

On Activation day we saw the launch of the first project built on the new CashTokens functionality with the 'Emerald DAO' project by BitcoinCashAutist. It launched on the upgrade day itself and utilized the brand new Paytaca-connect functionality to connect your paytaca browser extension wallet to the Emerald DAO Dapp to lock up BCH and Mint an Emerald NFT!

The CashTokens launch day is also the genesis for the DogeCash meme-token which got created in the first hour or so after launch. Besides CashTokens related stuff, the upgrade day also marked the reveal and beta release of the Selene Wallet. A brand new BCH-only wallet with great focus on usability and with a strong focus on BCH specific features.

Despite the very positive community sentiment and technical advances the price had stagnate around only 120$ since the beginning of the year. So any price-pump on the activation turned out to be hopium even though the BCH fundamentals got a lot better.

#Start of the CashTokens Ecosystem

The Paytaca team had also prepared their own project to utilize with the PaytacaConnect functionality of their browser namely the Bitcats NFT Collection! They revealed the project a few days after the CashTokens upgrade and just like the Emerald Dao it used the new CashTokens features in CashScript for their project. This demonstrates a trend for future BCH dapps: wallet connect + cashscript smart contract.

An unfortunate thing that happened soon after the CashTokens launch is that impersonators copied the open source code of 'my CashTokens webwallet' and launched fake versions of the wallet in an attempt to steal people's fund. Because of this my webwallet had to urgently get a clear brand and domain-name. Luckily for me, Jason Dreyehner, the author of the CashTokens spec, came to help out! When working out the best course of action and deciding on a new brand Jason suggested 'Cashonize' which I loved right away! A few days later my webwallet finally had a clear brand, after more than 5 months of development...

#Pieces Coming Together

Two weeks after the CashTokens launch, Paytaca revealed their CashTokens roadmap related to the Bitcats project: First they wanted to finish proper support for CashTokens in their wallet, then they wanted to develop and NFT marketplace, which is an essential piece for actually allow the bitcats NFTs to be traded and lastly they planned to build a CashTokens airdrop tool.

Later that week, a CashTokens marketplace already appeared with the launch of Tapswap. Tapswap is a non-custodial marketplace for CashTokens so it allows the buying and selling of both fungible and non-fungible CashTokens! Tapswap was the third dapp to leverage PaytacaConnect to allow for a great user experience linking an application to your wallet. Tapswap functioned as an enabler for the nascent CashTokens ecosystem: featuring the bitcats and emerald DAO, allowing people to trade and collect them, as well as the other user-created tokens.

June 1st, 2 weeks after the launch of the CashTokens ecosystem there was the highly anticipated launch of the BCH Guru NFTs. The project sold out their first wave of 2,000 NFTs in less than 24 hours! The surrounding hype also served as a very positive environment for Tapswap with much trading activity taking place.

The biggest drawback of PaytacaConnect, used by TapSwap, the Bitcats and the Emerald DAO is the lock-in to a custom integration which only works with the paytaca browser extension. Realizing this shortcoming, Pat launched a flipstarter campaign to design and implement a WalletConnect V2 implementation in the beginning of June. Such a general wallet connect implementation that can be implemented by multiple wallet and isn't specific to just browser extension wallets is an essential piece of infrastructure for dapps! This way many different wallets (and all their users!) can interact with different smart contract applications without needing being reliant on any specific wallet, which allows users to easily switch or use multiple different ones.

#Price pump

Any effect of all these developments on price remained absent, with the BCH price being even on a bit of a decline since the start of the year, from 125$ to 105$. This changed spectacularly on the last week of June when the price almost 3X'ed up to a high of 305$, stabilizing around 220$. Crypto prices work in mysterious ways. This could be seen as the long awaited 'CashTokens pump' even though fundamentals probably did have nothing to do with it.

#AMM DEXes

On July 1st Cauldron DEX launched, with 1 trading pair: BCH-SOCK, their own token which is redeemable for real-world socks. The dapp uses a built-in webwallet similar to BCH Bull platform.

Besides Cauldron there was also another AMM DEX released called Fex.cash, instead of the BCMR metadata standard it focused on CRC20 tokens. CRC20 is a token standard on top of CashTokens which introduces a squattable name system for token-names. This way the protocol incentives claiming popular names (squatting) with the hopes of being to resell them later. The CRC20 standard was something specific to projects and builders in the Chinese/Eastern BCH ecosystem but there was pretty much no outreach or collaboration with the rest of the CashTokens ecosystem which was building upon the BCMR metadata standard which doesn't have a squattable token-name gimmick.

End of June Paytaca delivered on their roadmap item to upgrade their mobile for CashTokens, with this achievement it was the first CashTokens app for mobile. In July Paytaca had more great news to share, they successfully finished a 450 k funding round! This makes them one of the best funded organizations in BCH without a doubt and enables them to expand the scope of their products. Further in July, Selene Wallet had their launch in the Apple app store, allowing IOS users to also use the new BCH only wallet!

#$Cash Token Drama

There was also some drama over the summer, because of a paid BitcoinDotCom ""press release"" promotion article for a CashToken called $Cash, confusingly. Although it had nothing to do with the protocol itself, the token tried to position itself like ORDI in the ordinals ecosystem, a token without use but which is seen as the face of the token-ecosystem. In a promo video they claimed it would make sense for $Cash to have 1 to 10% of the value of BCH.

Luckily the BCH community's immune system kicked in, like an over-trained muscle to get the article remove, and warn everybody about the misleading pump-and-dump project. $Cash was one of the first tokens created following the CRC20 standard reflecting bad upon the creators, as it was not clear whether they were associated.
BCH Day

August 1st, which is the Bitcoin Cash anniversary (a.k.a. BCH Day), the second wave of 2,000 BCH Guru NFTs was released, at a slightly increased price. Also on BCH Day, I helped Itachu tokenize art in celebration of the Bitcoin Cash anniversary. Itachu is an independent digital artist who previously created the Reapers collection for SBCH and he released his first work on CashTokens with his graffiti artwork on BCH Day, this collaboration between the two of us would be the start of a whole journey for the remainder of the year.

#Fungibles catching up

Early august was also the release of Tokenstork: an overview website for fungible CashTokens, with the intent to become a Coinmarketcap-like website. The first version of the website did not have price-information for the tokens, only information on the supply, tokenId and social media links for each token project. This was because of the simple reason that there was no DEX to get the token prices from, there was only Tapswap, the CashTokens marketplace.

This changed later in august, with the Cauldron Beta which allows for users to add trading pairs to the website by adding the initial liquidity, it also enabled users to create an additional micro-pools for already existing trading pairs and earn so fee percentage this way, a first example of yield on CashTokens.

#Tooling tooling tooling

Over the summer, there was another big push to improve the tooling for devloping with CashTokens. For example mid July the BitCash library released version 1.0.0 which added CashTokens support to the library. It was the first python library to add CashTokens support, diversifying the tooling away from the heavy javascript focus. Another major piece of infrastructure: the BCH full node with integrated address indexer successfully completed a crowdfunder to bring the node back into consensus and have it validate the new network rules. This means catching up with the last 2 upgrades when it fell out of consensus. Notable was that an outside developer, OP_Return stepped up to take the initiative, and with this committed to maintaining the project for multiple years.

There were also some minor pieces of tooling I created like a BCMR Token explorer and a BCMR-generator. Then there was also the crowfunder for CashScript to upgrade the SDK for smart contract interactions by creating an 'advanced transaction builder' and to add reusable libraries to CashScript. Flipstarter once again proved itself as a vital tool for funding infrastructuree 'public goods' in the BCH space.

#The next upgrade

With the CashTokens upgrade already being long in the pipeline and being locked-in in November, there had already been a lot of work on proposals for the next upgrade: the main contender became the adaptive blocksize limit CHIP by BitcoinCashAutist. The key idea was to solve the need for a small group of technical leaders to have to decide when and by how much to increase the blocksize on a continuous basis. Instead, an algorithm was fixed in advance which is slowly adaptive to the actual needs of the network, automatically allowing up-to a 2X increase in allowed throughput each year.
Tooling NFT Mint

On august 8th I teased to be working on something big with Itachu, later Josh Ellithorpe, the well known BCH dev who previously worked with Itachu on the Reapers project on SBCH had also joined the team. The reveal of this secretive project came on September 1st: Cash-Ninjas project.

The tooling to do an NFT minting contract on CashTokens was sorely missing, that's why the goal with the Cash-Ninjas from the beginning was to develop open-source for CashTokens NFT mints, for others to use. We designed our minting contract from the ground up and innovated on the approach of the Bitcats to enable a multi-threaded minting contract and reveal the art right at mint. The Cash-Ninjas roadmap included bridging the Reapers NFTs over from the dead SmartBCH sidechain to CashTokens!

#Integrated Ecosystem

The launch of the Cash-Ninjas was delayed by exactly one week until October 8th, this gave enough time to finish the Wallet Connect functionality into the minting dapp. The day before the Cash-Ninjas mint I merged the work by Pat to integrate WalletConnect into Cashonize. With this, Cashonize was officially the first wallet on Bitcoin Cash supporting the general wallet Connect protocol with Pats BCH integration. The next day, October 8th, the Cash-Ninjas launched as a fully open-source project with Cashonize as the only compatible wallet.

Two days after the launch of the mint, there was already a second compatible wallet when Zapit added support for wallet connect. This was quickly followed by Paytaca, which added WalletConnect support a few days later. Now suddenly the 3 CashTokens wallets were all capable of of connecting to the CashNinjas website and minting NFTs!

The ecosystem for fungible CashTokens also became a much more integrated towards the end of September when Tokenstork integrated Cauldron prices. With Cauldron as the price-source TokenStork could accurately calculate the total-value-locked (TLV) and the market cap for the different fungible CashTokens.

#Bitcoin Cash Podcasts

In November General Protocols introduced 'General Protocols Spaces', a X/Twitter centered podcast with open discussion about all the latest developments on Bitcoin Cash. GP uploaded their first 10 Spaces to a YouTube playlist, and started making shorts for the different episodes to make the content more accessible.

The Bitcoin Cash podcast also stayed super consistent, getting to it's 100th episode in December, featuring Roger Ver! Here a screenshot of some of the latest episodes of the year:

November also marked half a year since the CashTokens activation date, here's a recap video of the ecosystem at that time:

#Fast-paced Innovation

November 28th End of November I successfully completed flipstarter funding for Cashonize, which was already 11 months old at that point, but was still a hobby project. The objective of the crowfunder was a complete rewrite of the wallet, a bunch of new features and releasing a mobile version of the wallet. Innovation in the Cashonize wallet took a big leap forward early December when Jim released his new protocol 'CashRPC' and implemented it into Cashonize. The goal of CashRPC is to improve the security of walletConnect by allowing wallets to recognize smart contract templates, and to allow for more complex dapps.

There was also huge innovation with regards to CashScript, Pat succesfully developed great debug tooling for the Bitcoin Cash smart contract language. This allows smart contract developers to much easier understand what is going wrong when their smart contract transactions fail: it gives them a debug report of on which line the error is, it gives the develope a custom error message for the failing check and allows to easily check intermediate values either by using console.log statement or checking the stack trace in the BitauthIDE environment.

#Rise WalletConnect apps

Early December the second item from the Paytaca roadmap got completed, instead of building a 2nd CashTokens marketplace they made an app for easy token-creation called 'CashTokens Studio'. The application released with both WallectConenct and PaytacaConnect.

Mid-December tapswap also added wallet connect to main site, this change was requested a lot by users who up until that point had to use a special beta version of Tapswap to be able to connect their Cashonize or Zapit wallet to the marketplace dapp. This further integrated the different pieces of the ecosystem making it much more accessible and convenient for users.

Additionally, in December there also was the release of 'early settlement' in the BCH Bull platform, a long awaited featured allowing users to exit their futures contract before the final settlement time.

#CashConnect & BCH Guru

The launch of the beta of the BCH Guru price prediction platfrom was announced for January 5th of the new year, following a private alpha period. The beta platform has 3 assets: BTC, ETH and BCH and allows 2 players to play each other in a game of predicting future USD prices. For the beta users can only bet with FURU tokens, the fungible token of the Guru project which was airdropped to all BCH Guru holders based on their collection rarity earlier in the year.

The BCH Guru platform uses 'CashConnect' to let a wallet connect to their more advanced smart contract. CashConnect is the new CashRPC protocol with WalletConnect as the transport layer, so it uses some components similar to the walletConnect specification Pat designed but it uses libauth templates under the hood. December 29th CashConnect got merged into mainline Cashonize from Jim's fork, in preparation for the upcoming BCH Guru app which was planning to use the new feature! And with that the year 2023 got concluded, with high anticipation for 2024.

#Year in review

2023 was the best year for BCH to-date. There was a huge amount of technical innovation and catching up with the rest of the crypto-ecosystem. BCH now has tooling to easily do an NFT Mint, it now has walletConnect to let users interact with dapps. CashScript, the BCH-specific smart contract language saw multiple major upgrades throughout the year. We saw multiple AMM DEXes launch on CashTokens and with Tapswap we saw a first non-custodial marketplace for CashTokens. And last but not least, we made industry wide innovation with CashConnect that can recognize smart contract templates, something the much more mature DeFi ecosystems don't even have.

Maybe most important of all, we see the beginning of a nicely integrated ecosystem were each piece builds upon the next, and where we squeeze the most out of our limited resources. In 2023 we saw a very unified community, all working towards innovation on CashTokens in a collaborative manner, aiming to grow the pie as a whole. CashTokens might well turn out to be the turning of the tide for BCH, from losing and hardship to winning and leading.

Price-wise the year 2023 was also good, starting 2023 at only roughly 100$ and ending the year at 260$ BCH. However zooming out BCH started the 2022 at 440$ (and had traded above 600$ just two months earlier) so the long term trend is still very bad. The anticipation is there for the BCH miner halving less than 100 days into 2024 to have a great positive impact on the price.

2024-01-09,16:59:22,cryptocurrency,Indian Crypto Exchanges Benefit from Finance Ministry Notice | Funds Coming In From Foreign Crypto Exchanges | What Is This All About?," 

https://i.redd.it/1cux0nntrfbc1.gif

\*\*Disclaimer:\*\* Does this look like financial advice? You are right. It isn‚Äôt. Treat it so.

‚ÄúDo Your Own Research‚Äù (DYOR) is not a fad but an important element of the cryptoverse. Do keep that in mind.

https://i.redd.it/w9knbbcxrfbc1.gif

## Indian Finance Ministry‚Äôs Show-Cause Notice to International Crypto Exchanges | That‚Äôs the TLDR

A couple of weeks back the Indian Finance Ministry issued a show cause notice to international crypto exchanges like KuCoin, Gateio, MEXC, Binance, and more for not complying with Indian regulations. There was a chance that the websites would be blocked in India and that saw the flight of Indian citizens' funds from these international exchanges.

https://preview.redd.it/leeyg6jzrfbc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f3e325694f3c48c2fab2814153dda09af3f757f

All the influx of funds was directed towards local Indian exchanges which were following the Financial Intelligence Unit‚Äôs (FIU) regulations. As such, local exchanges like CoinDCX, WazirX, BuyUCoin, and others saw a surge in deposits. Not only the deposits but also trades witnessed a surge.

Such movement of funds would likely continue unless the international exchanges follow the FIU‚Äôs norms and respect the Indian regulatory framework.

https://preview.redd.it/f7w1g0s1sfbc1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3252dd0127238d4b428fa2e5db41f3db909e5299

# Regulations in the Indian Crypto Space | Everything Other Than TLDR

Following India‚Äôs call for a global framework for crypto-related financial interactions at the G20 Summit, India developed its own local Financial Intelligence Unit‚Äôs (FIU) norms for regulation. The Indian crypto exchanges were largely complying with these norms, while the international exchanges weren‚Äôt. The call for the same was made to ensure nefarious actors do not play in the crypto space, hurting the Indian users.

On December 28, 2023, the Finance Ministry issued a show-cause notice to nine international exchanges including Binance, KuCoin, Gateio, MEXC, and the likes. The intention, it is supposed, was to make these exchanges comply with the domestic norms and regulations. There were also murmurs that these exchange websites could be blocked in India if they did not comply with the norms.

The news set the Indian crypto users in motion, withdrawing their assets from the named international exchanges to Indian exchanges. This resulted in an increase in deposits of over 2000% in CoinDCX, 250% in WazirX, and similar numbers in other exchanges in India. Even small exchanges witnessed a surge in deposits. So, the Indian exchanges complying with the laid down norms and regulations benefited the most. Not only was there a surge in deposits but also transactions and trades.

But why International Exchanges when there are Indian Exchanges? Here‚Äôs why.

https://preview.redd.it/2ea2rel4sfbc1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b625c8b2404b2567db66520df657a6b04eec177f

# Why International Exchanges When There Are Domestic Ones? | The Reason

There is no rocket science as to why. It is a matter of convenience and availability.

Let‚Äôs take an example of stock markets, and then we will come to crypto markets. If I wanted to buy shares of Tesla, I would necessarily have to buy them from NYSE as Tesla is not listed on NSE in India. So, based on the stocks I want to buy, I may register with exchanges beyond India‚Äôs borders.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kvwgwdw7sfbc1.jpg?width=344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8eccb03657e86da2a8bc2172b7e17cde6e2a5363

The same logic applies to crypto exchanges. While the main coins like BTC, ETH, XRP, and likes would be available across exchanges, some specific tokens like Moons or Donut of Reddit would not be available everywhere. So, if I, as an investor, wanted to buy Moons or Donuts, I would necessarily have to look at international exchanges since these are not available on the Indian exchanges.

So, the basic premise is the ability of investors and traders to find the coins/tokens of their choice. In this endeavor, they end up going to international exchanges. This is true for all markets and countries.

https://preview.redd.it/5tsveop8sfbc1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=9be20a553a3e13caee743ec5fd142a868626aca6

# What Next?

In the pursuit of norms and regulations, such hick-ups are expected not only in India but in every country in the world. It is a passing phase, where exchanges learn to comply with international norms and regulations. In doing so, they really become international crypto exchanges.

So, we are in a phase where we will have more and more truly international crypto exchanges. This is a good place to be, and we as users, can only benefit from the move!

I rolled over my 401k into an IRA. It was not a large amount, only $3,081. I did some research and ended up buying 7 shares of Google, and 7 shares of NVDA yesterday. I plan on buying more of those, and also buying Microsoft and Apple. I have a lot of catching up to do, I will need to max out my IRA every year.

2025-01-23,05:43:44,Investing_Discussion,Tell me fair value of Costco (Fill in the blanks with your company research),"Price Today: $944.70  
Fair Value: $477.54  
Overvalued: 49.9%

# Key Components of the DCF Analysis for $COST

|Year|Projected Free Cash Flow (FCF)|Present Value of FCF (Discounted)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Year 1|$8.08 Billion|$7.48 Billion|
|Year 2|$8.99 Billion|$7.70 Billion|
|Year 3|$10.00 Billion|$7.93 Billion|
|Year 4|$11.13 Billion|$8.16 Billion|
|Year 5|$12.39 Billion|$8.41 Billion|

# How We Arrived at These Numbers

# Step 1: Projected Free Cash Flows (FCF)

We start by forecasting COST‚Äôs Free Cash Flow (FCF) over the next five years. The formula for Free Cash Flow is:

The projected FCFs are as follows:

* Year 1: $8.08 Billion
* Year 2: $8.99 Billion
* Year 3: $10.00 Billion
* Year 4: $11.13 Billion
* Year 5: $12.39 Billion

# Step 2: Present Value of Future Cash Flows (PVFCF)

To account for the time value of money, we discount each future cash flow back to its present value using the formula:

Where WACC is the Weighted Average Cost of Capital. Using the given values, we calculate the present values as:

* Year 1: $7.48 Billion
* Year 2: $7.70 Billion
* Year 3: $7.93 Billion
* Year 4: $8.16 Billion
* Year 5: $8.41 Billion

# Step 3: Terminal Value (TV)

Beyond the forecasted period, we assume COST‚Äôs cash flows will grow at a constant rate. The formula for calculating Terminal Value using the perpetuity growth method is:

# Step 4: Present Value of Terminal Value

We discount the Terminal Value to its present value using the formula:

# Step 5: Enterprise Value (EV)

We sum the present values of the projected cash flows and the present value of the terminal value to get the Enterprise Value:

# Step 6: Equity Value

To calculate the Equity Value, we subtract the company‚Äôs net debt from the Enterprise Value:

# Step 7: Equity Value Per Share

We calculate the Equity Value Per Share by dividing the Equity Value by the number of diluted shares outstanding:

# Actionable Insights

Comparing the calculated fair value of¬†**$477.54**¬†to the current stock price of¬†**$944.70**, it is evident that COST is currently trading at a significant premium. This suggests that the stock may be overvalued, presenting a potential selling opportunity.

**Conclusion:**¬†Based on the DCF analysis, COST‚Äôs intrinsic value per share is $477.54, which is significantly lower than the current market price of $944.70. This suggests that COST is overvalued and may present an attractive selling opportunity for long-term investors.

2025-01-20,19:32:58,Investing_Discussion,Thoughts on my current investment trajectory as someone new to investing ,"Thoughts on my current investment trajectory

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm about to turn 25 and am currently making 70k per year. I‚Äôve just recently gotten into investing and figured it‚Äôd be helpful to get some feedback and potential advice on my current investing plan, behavior, trajectory, etc

Having just started a few weeks ago, I‚Äôve invested 11K total after essentially sitting on untouched funds in my savings account that have accumulated over the last 3 years of working after graduating. The 11k of total investments is currently broken down as follows: 

* 40% = 4.5k of ETF‚Äôs in VOO, QQQ, and VUG
* 50% = 5.5k of individual Blue Chip stocks in the form of AAPL, AMZN, TSLA, GOOGL, META, MSFT, NVDA, AMD, AXON, and GE
* 10% = 1k of Crypto in BTC and ETH 

It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that I contribute around 6% to my 401k with 50% company match leaving me with a total of around 8k in my 401k currently 

With all of this in mind, any basic feedback or advice? Is 3 ETF‚Äôs too many? Should I have more in ETF‚Äôs rather than individual blue chip stocks? Am I not contributing enough to my retirement given my age, income, and current investments? Etc 

I really appreciate the help! ",NVDA,NVIDIA

2025-01-19,08:01:17,Investing_Discussion,Investing opinion ,"
 From what I've learned in trading, that it is more safe when you understand, what you are doing and know about the markets and trends. 

 When I begin my new trading session, I look first at what is actual today or where to invest for a longer-term deal. Because technical charts are something that I base mostly on and afterward on the breaking news.  

 When I have an information collected from the trading session, then I decide on how much and for how long I want to invest. My usual investment takes just some small part of my balance into a single deal, and the level of profit I look to set up for it to be higher than loss. 

 When I've chosen where to invest and for how long, and set up chosen revenue, I also minimize my losses with adequate leverage, and move  to the activation part. When an investment is done, then starts psychological pressure from the money being used to deal. 

When the result is fine and in a green color, then I am calm and even then think about changing the profit to a bigger or smaller amount. On that step holding, it is necessary to keep on prediction and resist to bad thought that can lose. Investment prioritizing wealthy people with money and goals. And from investing, you can also change financial status and grow in income and personal field.  

Financial education makes life better and gives you something to enjoy every day, with whom you live. Good environment and people around is mandatory for proper investments because you must be concentrated on the making predictions and resist wish to make some changes or even to close a deal before planned amount. 

So to hold an investment can help a hobby or game; just not sit all the time on a trading platform and look how the chart moves. Just live your life and enjoy it, making investments in what you like or value. For me, investing in stocks of the companies I like or use in my daily life. Tesla because I want Tesla. Amazon because it's a lot to buy on it, and its brand,  eBay because it has a product settled there.  MC Donald's, Warner Brothers  or Ferrari, the same. 

 My intention in making investments just rises with every profitable trade that I've done, and my wish to learn and develop  from every loss. I will succeed, I know, because I am on my way.

2025-01-10,04:23:31,Investing_Discussion,The Magnificent Seven: Tech Bubble or Sustainable Growth?,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla - have been the talk of the town in 2025, almost single-handedly driving the S&P 500's growth. But as these companies' stocks soar, it's worth asking: are we witnessing genuine growth, or are we on the brink of another tech bubble?

First, the valuation of these companies has reached sky-high levels. Nvidia, for instance, has a P/E ratio that's off the charts, reflecting not just their lead in AI and cloud computing but also a market betting on endless growth. However, there's often a gap between what the market expects and the reality of earnings, especially as market saturation kicks in, potentially slowing down growth.

Looking back, every time tech stocks have been this hyped, it's a sign that a bubble might be forming. The current signs are clear: there's an extreme hype around emerging tech, investor sentiment is overly optimistic, and valuations seem detached from fundamental performance.

So, how do we manage this risk? Don't put all your eggs in one basket, particularly not in these high-valuation stocks. Diversify your investments. Look for companies with solid fundamentals and reasonable valuations to balance your portfolio. Also, keep an eye on macroeconomic changes like interest rate movements, which can put pressure on these high-flying stocks.

The growth drivers for these companies, like AI, cloud computing, and electric vehicles, are indeed powerful, but can they keep up this pace? AI, for example, has pushed Nvidia's stock to new heights, but its widespread adoption might not happen as quickly as the market hopes. Tesla's valuation, largely based on the promise of autonomous driving, doesn't fully align with its current profit margins, raising questions about its sustainability.

Market sentiment is another big factor. When optimism reaches its peak, it's often a sign that a correction is due. In an environment where interest rates are climbing, high-valuation tech stocks are particularly vulnerable as investors start seeking safer havens.

So, while the Magnificent Seven have indeed been the stars of 2025, the high valuations and market hype warrant caution. History tells us that tech stock corrections follow periods of extreme valuations. As investors, combining fundamental analysis with a careful watch on market sentiment will be key. Diversify, stay rational, and don't get carried away by the hype. After all, in investing, it's often about balancing the excitement of potential with the reality of risk.

2025-01-07,13:22:05,Investing_Discussion,Where are you investing to benefit from the AI economy?,"According to Reuters: ""Nvidia (NVDA.O), on Monday took the wraps off new products such as artificial intelligence to better train robots and cars, souped-up gaming chips and its first desktop computer, as it expounded upon its potential to expand its business...

...Nvidia's stock closed at a record high of $149.43 on Monday, bringing its valuation to $3.66 trillion and making it the world's second-most valuable listed company behind Apple (AAPL.O).""

While the gaming chip is very much an incremental improvement of an existing product, Nvidia has also released new products. In established businesses like chips, it will increasingly come under pressure, from both competitors and customers, as they design their own chips - manufacturing may be contracted out.

To keep increasing its stock price, it may depend on sales from new businesses. But the AI story is just beginning, as on Monday, on a blog, Altman of OpenAI described that AI agents will be taking over human jobs, as soon as this year; and Microsoft is also testing and developing AI agents. He also said that Artificial General Intelligence is within reach, and they are already planning for Artificial Super Intelligence. Don't know how much computing power and data, it will take to develop, test, and run, these AI models - but if developed, the impact on the economy, markets, and society may be stratospheric.

Meanwhile Microsoft is increasing capital spending on data centers for cloud services and AI. If I remember correctly, they were planning to invest USD 80 billion, in 2025.

I have invested in the Nasdaq 100. There are only a few options available easily to Indian investors to invest in USA, technology, and AI. Long term AI will drive broad economic growth. Industries and companies that are quick in adopting AI, will see gains in productivity, reduction of costs, and increase in sales, leading to higher stock market valuations. Therefore I also remain invested in a US bluechip fund.

2025-01-07,10:17:23,Investing_Discussion,The Wealth Secrets of 2025 According to Silicon Valley Investors,"From the All In Podcast's 2025 predictions, all four guests are seasoned tech investors with net worths exceeding $1 billion. Their bold early 2024 predictions included Trump's return to power, Bitcoin surpassing $100,000, and Reddit's stock price increasing fivefold.

This year's predictions are still quite daring, but they certainly contain some eye-catching elements, so take them with a grain of salt.

1. In the realm of AI large models, Google makes a triumphant return, OpenAI falls from grace, and xAI rises rapidly: By 2025, they believe model capabilities will become homogeneous, favoring players who possess computing power, control traffic channels, and have boundless resources.

2. A wave of robotic infrastructure begins, propelling the reindustrialization of America: They view Chinese company Yushu's new demo as a turning point in the industry, believing that under Trump‚Äôs leadership, America will significantly invest in its own robots to build high-tech factories for a new era, rivalling the effort in AI infrastructure.

3. Inference scenarios increase AI computing power demand, memory chip cycle reverses: The demand for memory in inference is high; HBM chips have a long-standing supply shortage and are Nvidia's biggest cost factor. The two companies currently able to supply such chips expect a significant turnaround in both performance and stock prices in 2025.

4. Autonomous driving explodes, upending the mobility landscape: Waymo's market share in San Francisco has already surpassed 20%, and Tesla is expected to enter the market soon. This prediction is indeed met with divided opinions in the market, yet Uber's stock price has declined as a result.

5. The birth of the Super App in the U.S.: Trump is expected to significantly relax merger and acquisition restrictions, which could lead to disruptive cases in the tech field, such as Tesla acquiring Uber or Amazon acquiring Doordash. The U.S. may see the emergence of a super app. So, is there a safety margin for Uber's stock price on the downside? Think big.

6. The seven ""sisters"" of American stocks will revert to mean pricing: The top 10 companies in the S&P 500 already account for 40% of the overall market, an unprecedented high. Following historical patterns, a mean reversion is inevitable‚Äîthis time, will it be different?

7. Chinese tech giants' stock prices will rebound significantly: The core logic is that they've already bottomed out; companies with good fundamentals are at single-digit P/E ratios (compared to around 25 in the U.S.). If U.S.-China conflicts turn out better than expected, they will be the most direct beneficiaries. They even speculate that a huge cooperation agreement could emerge from U.S.-China talks.

8. The actual GDP growth rate in the U.S. will exceed 5%: There is hope for this over the next four years, driven primarily by AI and deregulation enhancing productivity.

9. A resurgence of socialist thinking, but uncoupled from wokeness: The growth driven by productivity will exacerbate wealth inequality, leading to calls for redistributive social systems, yet it will cluster economic issues and weaken DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion).

10. Dollar-denominated stablecoins will be adopted on a large scale.

Personally, I tend to favor short-term operations. Currently, I‚Äôm optimistic about $BGM, a company that just acquired an AI insurance platform and saw a 24% surge in its stock price yesterday. It combines resources from the biotech, pharmaceutical, and AI insurance industries, alongside China's largest insurance brokerage, AIX, and data support from Baidu.

2025-01-06,17:26:41,Investing_Discussion,The Year for Equal Weight? ,"In 2024, the S&P 500 achieved a 23.3% gain, marking its best two-year performance this century. This surge was predominantly driven by mega-cap technology stocks, fueled by investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Companies like Nvidia and Meta experienced substantial gains, significantly influencing the market-cap-weighted index. 

Conversely, the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index underperformed during the same period. This underperformance highlights the concentration of gains in a select group of large-cap tech companies, which dominate the market-cap-weighted index but have less impact on the equal-weighted counterpart. 

Implications of the Divergence

The growing disparity between these indices has several implications:
	‚Ä¢	Market Concentration: The dominance of a few large-cap tech stocks has led to increased concentration in the market-cap-weighted index, raising concerns about the 		sustainability of such a narrow market leadership.
	‚Ä¢	Valuation Discrepancies: The valuation gap between the equal-weighted and cap-weighted S&P 500 is nearing record extremes, suggesting that the broader market may 		be undervalued relative to the concentrated mega-cap segment.
	‚Ä¢	Investment Strategies: This divergence prompts investors to consider alternative strategies, such as equal-weighted funds or sector rotation, to mitigate risks associated 		with market concentration and potentially enhance returns.

Historical Context and Future Outlook

Historically, periods of significant divergence between these indices have often preceded market corrections or shifts in leadership. The current extreme divergence may signal potential volatility ahead, especially if the concentrated gains in mega-cap tech stocks prove unsustainable.

2025-01-03,11:25:09,Investing_Discussion,"Tesla sales down in 2024, leading to a 6% dip in shares","According to Reuters: ""But reduced European subsidies, a shift in the United States toward lower-priced hybrid vehicles and tougher competition especially from China's BYD (002594.SZ), hurt Tesla.
The U.S. EV maker's shares closed about 6% lower.""

How will Musk divide attention between government service and his own businesses in 2025? He is already the richest man in the world. Is it more important to serve your country, or become the world's first trillionaire? Will Tesla benefit from favourable policy from the new administration, or will the trade war with China, lead to reduced sales in China in 2025.

The world continues to electrify with financial and other regulatory support from governments. In Norway, in 2024, about 89% of new vehicle sales were EV. What are the trends impacting Tesla? Will car sharing services result in a decline in sales for cars? Will net zero goals result in an increase in sales for EVs?

I think if Tesla can manage to stay ahead of the competition, in self driving, battery technology, connectivity etc. it has a chance of continuing to grow. But with Chinese companies such as BYD, and other companies like BMW, and Fiat electrifying, Tesla is no longer part of a very limited choice.

How would you rate the stock, and the future sales of Tesla?

¬†These will power the future technological advancements we have whether it‚Äôs robots, EVTOL, ARVR headsets, etc. I think this theme is in its infancy. Lithium would be a beneficiary as well.

# Robotics.

This is the real world hardware application of AI, we already have companies such as Tesla, Figure, etc. making major progress. I think we see a breakthrough/ChatGPT moment in 25.¬†

# Crypto¬†

Pro crypto administration for the first time. 3rd year of a bitcoin 4 year cycle.¬†

# Psychedelics

Posted about earlier. RFK at the helm of healthcare regulation is bullish for psychedelics as he has already advocated for the mainstream adoption of psychedelic drugs.¬†

# Financials¬†

¬†looser regulation under Trump. Almost certainly expect more M&A this year, and this boom in M&A will lead to higher interest in these financial firms' investment banking divisions. ¬†

# Lidar¬†

Autonomous vehicles and robotics are massive themes. But we need to think about the technologies that are required to make these developments possible. MBLY, INVZ, OUST all names to watch. These provide the hardware and softrware required to make autonomous driving a reality.¬†

# ¬†Solar¬†

Best performing sector in the first year of Trump's first term. With Musk's influence too, who has a vested interest in the success of solar, I think we see tailwinds here.¬†

# Quantum Computing

continuation of mainstream interest. Willow processor showcases quantum‚Äôs potential. Scalable quantum technologies address critical challenges in healthcare (accelerating drug discovery), finance (enhancing risk modeling) & logistics (optimizing supply chains) through scalable quantum technologies. GOOGL name behind the sector gives weight.¬†

# Nuclear¬†

¬†Chris Wright on board of OKLO. Likely to see more interest from big cap tech stocks that need to power their interests in AI, as GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT and others have moved to do.¬†

2025-01-01,20:50:35,Investing_Discussion,AMD,"Anyone have any opinions on buying AMD?  

Hearing the rumour mill about their next gpu/cpu line up and seeing Nvidia leaks showing high pricing with low vram on their cards makes me feel like AMD share value could bump soon. 

AMD sitting fairly low just now at 120 - good investment for a year+ hold?",NVDA,NVIDIA
2025-01-01,12:05:10,Investing_Discussion,Why I'm bearish on Nvidia ,"I've recently become very bearish on Nvidia, here's why:

**Inference - Size isn't everything and the rise of reasoning**

Reports from inside OpenAI suggest GPT-5 has disappointed and the same seems to be true of other next scale LLMs. For whatever reason, it looks like training on larger and larger datasets is no longer bringing the goods. The scaling law, that took us from gpt-1 to gpt-4, has broken but all is not lost. OpenAI's latest o3 looks incredibly impressive. The secret is that it thinks before it speaks and reasons through problems (at huge cost).

My assumption is that reasoning is going to be the new frontier. In other words, the next phase in AI development will be focused on inference rather than training. This is important for Nvidia because their chips specifically excel at training. Other chips from the likes of AMD are much more competitive when it comes to inference.

**DeepSeek, the cost of training and a note on the human brain**

Your brain consumes significantly less energy than a 100 watt lightbulb, which is relevant because it shows how far we can go to reduce the cost of intelligence. This compares with the reputedly hundreds of thousands of dollars it cost gpt-o3 to run the benchmark tests.

Chinese up-start, I mean start-up, DeepSeek recently launched a state of the art model which compares favourably with GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 and outperforms Meta's and Alibaba's best. Good on them! But the really impressive thing is it took just two months to train, only cost $5.58 million and it was all done without Nvidia chips because of U.S. export controls.

What does this mean for Nvidia? Well, it's recent news and I'm still digesting it but I think it means the cost of training is going to plummet. I don't think it necessarily means that training LLMs on more data is going to lead to dramatic improvements - but I might be wrong. My best guess is that the demand for the GPUs Nvidia makes is going to fall through the floor.

**AI adoption - Stupid is what stupid does**

So far as I understand it, the cost of inference has also plummeted with DeepSeek's V3. However, this is early days and I'm not an AI researcher. Let's say it takes some time for the cost of advanced reasoning models, like gpt-o3, to come down, which so far as I know it might. Sam Altman thinks ""we will hit AGI much sooner than most people in the world think and it will matter much less"". This makes sense if the cost of advanced reasoning models remain very high. The question that worries me is how far and fast AI will be adopted given this state of affairs. Cheap AI still makes incredibly simple mistakes and I'm not convinced that in their current form AI agents are a good replacement for people, except for some very specific tasks.

Nvidia's valuation relies on a lot of growth and that growth ultimately relies on adoption. I'm not sure that happens any time soon if Sam's right.

**What are other people's thoughts. Is Nvidia's valuation still justified?**",NVDA,NVIDIA
2024-12-30,07:14:16,Investing_Discussion,thoughts on GPU and AI computing chip sector,"‚¶Å Market Outlook:
  With the rise of generative AI and large-scale language models, the demand for GPUs and AI computing chips is expected to remain strong. Although the growth rate of GPU demand has recently slowed, the overall sector still holds significant potential. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for AI chip shipments is projected to be around 58% from 2022 to 2026.

Opportunities for IoT semiconductors continue to expand in both consumer and industrial applications, with the market size expected to reach $108 billion and a CAGR of approximately 10%.
‚¶Å Key Companies:
  While NVIDIA is not explicitly mentioned, the trends in this sector are still closely related to it. Furthermore, companies that leverage AI across various industries are expected to experience significant growth by 2025. For instance, Destiny Tech ($DXYZ) holds OpenAI, which specializes in language models; Lemonade ($LMND) and AIX INC. ($AIFU) focus on AI insurance; Carvana ($CVNA) deals with AI-powered used cars; Applovin ($APP) is involved in AI advertising; Upstart ($UPST) offers AI loans; Palantir ($PLTR) works on AI intelligence; Opendoor Technologies ($OPEN) is in AI real estate; Duolingo ($DUOL) focuses on AI learning; and Tempus ($TEM) and BGI Group ($BGM) are engaged in AI healthcare; UiPath ($PATH) specializes in AI automation.",NVDA,NVIDIA

2024-12-26,10:18:25,Investing_Discussion,Who Will Be the Winner of the Future?,"Investors now expect a significant decline in Nvidia's market share by 2027, leading to slower revenue growth. However, the market underestimates two points:
1. The advantages of CUDA.
2. The annual product improvement cycle.
   I believe that CUDA has strong advantages that will weaken the ability of cloud service providers (CSPs) to promote custom chips to customers. Since the cloud market comprises about 50% of the entire market, I consider it a significant victory if custom chip providers can capture half of this market between 2027 and 2030.

Currently, the market is making assumptions based on comments from Broadcom's CEO, presuming that most CSP revenue will flow to custom chip providers, but Broadcom's assumption may be overly optimistic. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether custom chips can keep pace with Nvidia's annual product launch rhythm, as each new product generation from Nvidia brings significant performance improvements. Our best estimate is that Nvidia's competitors are still in an innovation cycle lasting about 1 to 2 years.

Nonetheless, the resulting AI supply chain will continue to benefit in the mid to long term, such as Adobe ($ADBE) for AI + Generative Content (AIGC), Unity Software ($U) for AI + Software, Palantir ($PLTR) for AI + Insurance, and Block ($SQ) for AI + Finance, among others.",NVDA,NVIDIA

2024-12-24,07:02:01,Investing_Discussion,AI Investment Opportunities - Big Tech Bets Big,"I've been eyeballing the AI scene lately, and holy cow, the investment hype is still sky-high! They're saying tech giants are gonna drop trillions on AI in the coming years. Like, OpenAI isn't even planning to drop a new model like GPT-5 in 2024, they're just polishing what they've got to stay on top. Smart move, right? It's like they're giving us a heads-up to jump into AI investments before it's too late.

Think about it - if these big dogs are ready to throw down that much cash, there's gotta be some serious moolah to be made. AI isn't some flash in the pan; it's reshaping everything from cloud computing to how we make chips, and even software. It's just getting started. IBM's been killing it with AI in business solutions, showing us how deep this can go.

But it's not just about the big names. There are these smaller companies doing cool, niche stuff that could really shake things up. Take Richtech Robotics, for example. They're blending AI with robotics in a way that's both smart and useful. 

Then you've got companies like NVIDIA, which is like the king of AI chips, and [C3.ai](http://C3.ai), which is doing some slick stuff with AI software for different industries. These guys, along with Richtech Robotics, are proving how AI can be the game-changer in all sorts of fields.

AI's not just for tech nerds anymore; it's hitting education, healthcare, finance - you name it. It's making things smarter, faster, and more personalized. Like, in finance, AI can sniff out fraud or predict market swings, and in healthcare, it's helping with everything from diagnosis to treatment plans. NVIDIA's moves in medical AI are a clear sign of where things are heading.

Investing in AI isn't just about picking the flashiest tech; it's about spotting who can actually make that tech work for real-world stuff. The AI scene is gonna be all over the place, with tons of opportunities popping up left and right.

So, if you're into tech and looking to invest, now's the time to get into AI. Don't just focus on the big players; there's potential in these smaller, scrappier companies like Richtech Robotics, Serve Robotics, and UBTECH Robotics. Let's keep an eye on this together!",NVDA,NVIDIA

¬† Bitcoin (BTC), the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has faced a notable correction, trading at $104,000 after a strong rally earlier in the year. Analysts attribute this pullback to profit-taking and fluctuating sentiment in the crypto markets. Despite the correction, BTC remains a focal point for investors, particularly with growing institutional interest and increased demand for decentralized financial solutions. ¬†

# Global Coal Demand Hits Record High

¬† According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global coal demand reached a historic peak in 2024.

2024-12-17,16:03:52,Investing_Discussion,"Markets on Fire: Fed Shifts, Trump Dollar Rally, and AI Boom Shake Up 2025!","The Fed‚Äôs Evolving Rate-Cut Strategy

  The Federal Reserve's approach to interest rate adjustments remains in flux as officials balance economic conditions and inflation trends. While investors anticipate a third consecutive rate cut this week, there are signals of a potential pause in early 2025. According to The Wall Street Journal, the Fed is considering slowing its pace of easing or even halting cuts entirely after the December reduction. Policymakers have expressed concerns about overstimulating the economy as inflation data stabilizes, prompting a cautious approach to further monetary easing. This shift could impact investor sentiment, as rate cuts have played a major role in driving equity market performance in 2024. A pause in rate reductions may force markets to recalibrate expectations heading into next year.

Wall Street Bets on Trump Dollar Rally

The U.S. dollar is on track for further strength, fueled by investor expectations surrounding President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs policies. The Financial Times reports that markets foresee a prolonged USD rally driven by favorable economic policies, including potential fiscal stimulus and tariffs under Trump‚Äôs leadership. The dollar‚Äôs resilience is also supported by the Federal Reserve‚Äôs anticipated slow and measured approach to rate cuts. Analysts argue that a stronger dollar could pose challenges for emerging markets and multinational companies, particularly those with significant foreign earnings. However, for U.S. investors, Trump‚Äôs economic agenda is seen as a tailwind for domestic markets .

Broadcom‚Äôs Rapid AI Market Surge

  Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) is emerging as a major contender in the booming AI semiconductor market, challenging Nvidia‚Äôs dominance. The company has aggressively positioned itself to capitalize on AI-driven demand, particularly in advanced chip technologies. TheStreet highlights that Broadcom's CEO underscored a ‚Äúcrucial shift‚Äù in the AI chip landscape, signaling growing competition and diversification within the sector. Broadcom‚Äôs ability to capitalize on AI momentum has propelled its market valuation, solidifying its position as one of the key beneficiaries of the AI revolution. This rapid growth underscores the rising importance of semiconductors in powering artificial intelligence infrastructure.

BofA‚Äôs Sell Signal for Stocks

  Bank of America (BofA) has issued a warning to investors, citing historically low cash allocations and record-high allocations to U.S. equities. According to Bloomberg, the December survey of global fund managers revealed a striking trend: investors are ‚Äúall-in‚Äù on stocks, leaving little room for defensive positioning. Historically, such extremes have often preceded market pullbacks or corrections. The survey results indicate a potentially overheated market environment, as high equity exposure and reduced cash reserves limit flexibility during market volatility. BofA's cautionary note serves as a reminder that bullish sentiment can sometimes signal a turning point in market momentum

Bitcoin Breaks Above $107,000

  Bitcoin (BTC) continues its remarkable rally, trading above the $107,000 mark as investor enthusiasm for digital assets surges. The recent rally reflects growing institutional adoption, renewed interest in decentralized finance, and optimism surrounding regulatory clarity. Bitcoin‚Äôs performance also aligns with broader market trends, where investors seek alternative assets amidst shifting monetary policies. The significant milestone reinforces Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and a hedge against traditional financial uncertainty, particularly during periods of economic transition.

Conclusion

  The financial landscape is experiencing notable shifts driven by central bank policies, geopolitical developments, and technological advancements. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs evolving stance on interest rates, the Trump-driven dollar rally, and Broadcom‚Äôs AI-driven growth reflect key market themes heading into 2025. However, cautionary signals from Bank of America regarding extreme equity allocations remind investors to remain vigilant amidst soaring optimism. Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs surge above $107,000 highlights the growing significance of digital assets in the evolving financial ecosystem.

4. Uber‚Äôs costs are already low and building a comparable fleet of self driving cars is insanely capital intensive even for Google or Tesla. Particularly to compete across Uber‚Äôs breadth of geographies.
5. Regulatory hurdles of getting self-driving cars on the road across all of Uber's markets will take significant time.

2024-12-10,07:55:25,Investing_Discussion,NVIDIA's Recent Drop: Short-Term Noise or Long-Term Opportunity?,"I‚Äôve noticed a lot of panic around NVIDIA‚Äôs (NVDA) recent 2.5% drop, reportedly due to China‚Äôs antitrust investigation. Some are quick to declare doom and gloom, but let‚Äôs take a moment to break this down.

NVIDIA isn‚Äôt just another tech stock‚Äîit‚Äôs the backbone of the AI revolution. Their GPUs dominate the market, and when it comes to AI applications, they‚Äôre practically indispensable. While China‚Äôs investigation might sound intimidating, it‚Äôs important to remember that the country is heavily invested in AI growth. Cutting ties with NVIDIA would likely hurt their ambitions as much as anyone else‚Äôs.

The antitrust probe could lead to some changes‚Äîperhaps pricing adjustments or a stronger push for local partnerships. But it‚Äôs far from a death sentence. If anything, it might force NVIDIA to deepen its presence in the Chinese market, which could turn into a long-term advantage.

Looking at the broader market, other tech giants like Google, Apple, and Microsoft have been doing just fine. NVIDIA‚Äôs dip seems more like a knee-jerk reaction to the news than a reflection of its actual value. These short-term selloffs often create opportunities for those of us with a long-term perspective.

If you believe in the future of AI, this might be a chance to accumulate shares at a discount. Fear-driven drops like this can shake up weak hands, but the fundamentals don‚Äôt lie‚ÄîNVIDIA remains a powerhouse.

What do you all think? Are you buying this dip, holding, or taking a step back to watch how this unfolds?",NVDA,NVIDIA

2024-12-09,08:12:54,Investing_Discussion,Nvidia‚Äôs Big Bet on AI Healthcare: Why It‚Äôs a Game-Changer for Investors,"So, Nvidia just did it again‚ÄîJensen Huang has gone all-in on AI healthcare, investing in a company owned by Vietnam‚Äôs richest guy. Big moves like this don‚Äôt happen randomly, and if you‚Äôre paying attention, this might be a signal to start looking closer at AI healthcare stocks. Let‚Äôs break this down and chat about a few stocks that could be solid long-term plays.

# What‚Äôs the Deal with Nvidia‚Äôs Investment?

Nvidia isn‚Äôt just a chip company anymore; it‚Äôs a full-on AI juggernaut. They‚Äôre in everything‚Äîgaming, robotics, data centers, and now healthcare. This investment isn‚Äôt some random whim; it‚Äôs part of their bigger plan to get their hands into every high-growth, data-heavy industry.

Why healthcare? Think about it: the industry is drowning in data, and AI is the lifeboat. Diagnosing diseases, creating treatment plans, and even developing new drugs‚Äîit‚Äôs all stuff AI can do faster and better. The Vietnamese company Nvidia backed specializes in cancer screening, which is huge. Early detection saves lives, and AI could make it more accessible worldwide.

# Why Should You Care About AI Healthcare?

The AI healthcare market is set to explode. Asia, especially, has crazy potential‚Äîmassive populations, healthcare gaps, and a growing appetite for tech solutions. Countries like Vietnam could leapfrog traditional healthcare models by going straight to AI-driven systems.

This isn‚Äôt just pie-in-the-sky thinking. Nvidia is making moves, and when companies like this throw down cash, it‚Äôs a sign there‚Äôs serious money to be made.

Okay, so Nvidia‚Äôs making waves, but what about the rest of the market? Here are a few names to keep an eye on:

* **Nvidia (NVDA)** Yeah, it‚Äôs the obvious one. Nvidia is the backbone of so many AI industries, and this move into healthcare could open up massive new revenue streams.
* **Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)** If you‚Äôve heard of robotic surgery, you‚Äôve probably heard of Intuitive. They‚Äôve been crushing it in this space and will likely benefit as AI takes over more precision healthcare tasks.
* **Teladoc Health (TDOC)** AI in telemedicine is a thing, and Teladoc is at the forefront. As digital healthcare becomes the norm, this one could see steady growth.

*  **Richtech Robotics (RR)** A company making robots like Scorpion (for bartending) and Medbot (for hospital delivery). They‚Äôre pushing automation in service and healthcare, and their focus on real-world applications makes them a promising pick for the long haul.

# So, What‚Äôs the Play Here?

If you‚Äôre into long-term investing, AI healthcare is where it‚Äôs at. But don‚Äôt get sucked into the hype‚Äîdo your research and look for companies that are actually delivering. Nvidia, RR, and SERV all have strong foundations, which makes them less risky bets in this fast-growing space.

And hey, patience is key. AI healthcare is still in its early days, but the groundwork is being laid. If you‚Äôre willing to stick it out, the rewards could be massive.

Nvidia‚Äôs move is a reminder that AI is reshaping industries right now, not five years down the line. Whether it‚Äôs cancer screening, robotic surgeries, or hospital automation, the possibilities are endless.

If you‚Äôre looking for the next big thing, AI healthcare might just be it. Start building your watchlist‚Äîstocks like SERV, RR, and NVDA could be the winners you‚Äôre looking for. And who knows? In a few years, you might be glad you got in early.",NVDA,NVIDIA

2024-11-28,08:09:18,Investing_Discussion,The AI Revolution is Here: Why Service Robots Could Fill America‚Äôs Growing Labor Gap,"With immigration policies tightening up and labor shortages becoming a real concern, especially in industries like hospitality, logistics, and retail, there‚Äôs a massive opportunity emerging in the¬†**AI-driven robotics sector**. This isn't just a futuristic pipe dream anymore‚Äîrobots are stepping up to the plate, and some companies are already leading the charge. Let‚Äôs dig into why I think this could be a game-changer for investors and a few companies that are worth keeping an eye on.

# Why Service Robots Are the Future

The labor market is shifting fast. With policies potentially reducing the availability of low-wage workers, industries that depend on these roles are scrambling. Enter¬†**service robots**‚Äîhigh-tech machines that can handle repetitive tasks, improve efficiency, and operate 24/7 without breaking a sweat (or unionizing, let‚Äôs be real).

Robots aren‚Äôt just replacing humans‚Äîthey‚Äôre enhancing operations by cutting costs, boosting productivity, and filling roles where labor shortages hit hardest. Companies adopting this tech early are not only staying competitive but also transforming entire industries.

# The Players in the Game

Here‚Äôs a rundown of some standout companies and robots that are making waves:

# 1.¬†Tesla‚Äôs Optimus

When Elon Musk says Optimus could be a bigger deal than cars, you pay attention. Optimus is designed to be a general-purpose robot, capable of performing a wide range of physical tasks. While it‚Äôs still early in development, Tesla‚Äôs track record of scaling innovative tech (hello, EVs and SpaceX) means Optimus could disrupt industries like manufacturing and logistics in ways we can‚Äôt even fully imagine yet.

# 2.¬†Richtech Robotics

Richtech has been quietly making moves in the¬†**service robot space**, and they‚Äôre not just dabbling‚Äîthey‚Äôre delivering.

**Adam**: This AI-powered robot already operates in ghost kitchens, helping with food prep and reducing overhead costs for small businesses. Think about the potential scale once more restaurants and food chains catch on.

**Delivery Robots**: Their lineup includes machines like¬†**Matradee Plus**¬†(food delivery),¬†**Medbot**¬†(hospital applications), and¬†**Titan**¬†(industrial logistics). With last-mile delivery being such a pain point, these robots could become indispensable.

# 3.¬†Figure 01

This humanoid robot is built for versatility. From warehouse work to customer service,¬†**Figure Robotics**¬†aims to make humanoid robots practical in environments where flexibility is key. Unlike traditional robots locked into specific tasks, Figure 01 offers adaptability, making it a strong contender as industries demand more advanced automation.

# 4.¬†Agility Robotics: Digit

If you haven‚Äôt seen¬†**Digit**, look it up. Agility Robotics has designed a humanoid robot that‚Äôs optimized for warehouse logistics and material handling. Digit‚Äôs bipedal design allows it to navigate spaces built for humans, which could be a game-changer for companies looking to integrate robots into existing infrastructure without massive redesigns. Amazon has already shown interest in this space, and Agility‚Äôs growing partnerships signal big potential.

# 5.¬†Serve Robotics

You‚Äôve probably seen those cute, boxy robots cruising around delivering takeout in major cities. Serve is all about streamlining local delivery, and their machines are already on the streets. With partnerships with companies like Uber Eats, this company is positioned to dominate the urban delivery market.

# Why Invest Now? Massive Market Growth: The global robotics market is projected to grow¬†20-30% annually, with service robots leading the charge.Labor Gaps Aren‚Äôt Going Away: As the population ages and immigration policies tighten, businesses will turn to automation out of necessity.Early-Stage Opportunity: While Tesla grabs headlines, many smaller companies in this space are still undervalued. Once the market catches on, we could see significant upside potential.

# Risks to Consider

No investment is risk-free. A few things to keep in mind:

**Tech Challenges**: Some of this tech is still evolving. Widespread adoption might take longer than expected.

**Regulation**: Local laws around automation and robotics could impact deployment.

**Competition**: The robotics space is heating up, and not every company will survive the race.

# Final Thoughts

Robotics isn‚Äôt just about cool gadgets‚Äîit‚Äôs about solving real-world problems. With labor shortages looming and AI tech advancing rapidly, service robots are positioned to be a cornerstone of future industries. Companies like¬†**Tesla**,¬†**Richtech Robotics**,¬†**Figure Robotics**,¬†**Agility Robotics**, and¬†**Serve Robotics**¬†are paving the way, and early investors in this space could see huge rewards.

What are your thoughts? Are you investing in this sector, or do you think it‚Äôs too early to tell?

2024-11-25,19:17:40,Investing_Discussion,Appreciate advice on business idea around investing,"Hi all, I'm working on an idea which aims to help analysts on stock research. I haven't worked professionally on the field before and so I'd appreciate your honest feedback.

The problem I'm trying to solve is reducing the amount of time it takes to search and extract key points when researching a stock. Let's say you are thinking about investing on NVIDIA, and instead of going through all reports and news you'd be displayed a condensed summary of any specific aspect you're looking for (yeah, powered by LLMs as many other ideas). E.g The analyst would ask what are NVIDIAs biggest threats? -> the tool would combine different sources and output for example the the geopolitical conflict around Taiwan and its impact on semiconductors.

\- Would a tool like this make sense for professional analysts?   
\- Is chat the interface for this or there would be a preferred way of searching for this data such as structured format?

**Tesla - Up 15% since the news**
I still dont understand the Trump-Musk romance. Republicans have always favored gas-powered cars with Trump known for his ""drill baby drill"". 
So not really sure if Tesla is going to gain or if Trump is going to switch his focus from Oil to EVs that easily. Or I figure on the long run tesla is still going to lose to Google on autonomy. 

Plus, i cant fathom that fact that investors are still believing his deadlines 
Robotaxi by 2027 (2 seater, slow charging and camera sensors) Every aspect of it is a redflag for consumers let alone delivering it in time. 

**Meta - Down 4% the past month**
Trump has always been a bit wary of Zuckerberg's social media antics. So should expect that tiff to continue? 

**Google** - This is another one that can actually gain from this change in government. Currently facing a breakup but could be lifted as Trump claims he has a rapport with Mr. Pichai and google has always been diplomatic when it comes to their relationship with both parties. 

**Oil & Gas** - Show we start dollar cost averaging Exxon, Valero and Chevron? 

Would love to know everyone's take here on these. And also, what other sectors are you guys keeping a close eye on as we go into Trump's second term.

2024-11-06,13:38:41,Investing_Discussion,Why Donald Trump‚Äôs Return Could Boost Demand for Robots ‚Äì A Long-Term Investment Opportunity,"

Hey everyone,

With Donald Trump making a return, I think there‚Äôs more to consider than just the political drama. Specifically, his policies could have a huge ripple effect on the labor market, especially in the service industry. Trump‚Äôs stance on illegal immigration means we could see a stronger push to reduce undocumented workers, which would lead to an even bigger labor shortage in industries like hospitality, food service, and logistics. If fewer workers are available, companies will likely have to fill that gap‚Äîand robots could be the answer.

That‚Äôs where robotics companies come in, especially ones like Tesla, Richtech Robotics (RR), and Serve Robotics. Tesla is aiming to make waves with its humanoid robots, while Serve Robotics focuses on last-mile delivery solutions in urban areas. But let‚Äôs talk about Richtech Robotics (RR) in particular because they‚Äôve already got robots deployed and working in real-world environments, addressing exactly the kind of labor shortages we‚Äôre talking about. RR‚Äôs service robots are already in use across various industries, from restaurants to healthcare facilities, and they‚Äôre receiving high praise from clients for their reliability and efficiency. Their tech isn‚Äôt just conceptual‚Äîit‚Äôs been tested and proven, which gives them a solid foothold as demand grows.

And then there‚Äôs Elon Musk himself. If he ends up being involved in government restructuring, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see him push for more automation within federal jobs too, given his passion for robotics and AI. If Musk advocates for more robots in both private and public sectors, we could see a huge surge in the robotics industry overall.

Sure, the attention is still on DJT stocks and crypto as short-term plays riding the Trump wave, but I see robotics as a sector with way more potential for sustainable growth. For those of us looking for long-term positions, robots could be the steady play we‚Äôre after, especially as the tech gets better and companies like RRÔºåServe continue proving their value in real-world applications.

Anyone else seeing this as a big moment to get into robotics stocks for the long haul?",TSLA,Tesla
2024-11-05,06:52:12,Investing_Discussion,Why is Elon Musk All In on Trump?,"I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about Elon Musk lately‚Äîspecifically, why he‚Äôs suddenly backing Trump so openly. If you‚Äôve been following Musk‚Äôs moves for a while, you know the guy isn‚Äôt exactly one to play it safe. He‚Äôs all about doing things his own way, whether it‚Äôs launching rockets or making electric cars cool. But aligning himself with someone as controversial as Trump? That‚Äôs a pretty bold move, even for him. So, what‚Äôs going on here?

For starters, Musk has always had a soft spot for people who like to mess with the system. Think about it: the dude practically made a career out of disrupting industries. Tesla challenged the car industry, SpaceX took on NASA, and now he‚Äôs getting into the whole AI game, which will probably shake things up in ways we can‚Äôt even imagine yet. Trump, for all his flaws, is also a disruptor. He didn‚Äôt play by the usual political rules, and that‚Äôs probably something Musk respects. There‚Äôs a kind of kinship there‚Äîa shared desire to break away from the traditional ‚Äúhow things are supposed to be done.‚Äù It‚Äôs like Musk sees Trump as someone who can push back against the establishment, just like Musk has done in his own way.

But honestly, I think there‚Äôs more to it than just a love for chaos. If we look at Musk‚Äôs business model, it‚Äôs clear he thrives in a less-regulated world. Under Trump, we saw massive tax cuts and deregulation‚Äîthings that allowed Musk‚Äôs companies to thrive. Less red tape means faster innovation, and that‚Äôs exactly what Musk is all about. He‚Äôs always pushing for faster development, especially when it comes to Tesla and SpaceX. So, backing Trump now might just be a calculated move, especially if he thinks another term will lead to more of the same: an environment that favors tech innovation and business growth.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: Musk is no stranger to playing the media game. Think about it‚Äîevery time he tweets something outrageous, it‚Äôs like the whole world stops to pay attention. Trump‚Äôs the same way. Both of them have this uncanny ability to command attention, and I‚Äôm sure Musk realizes that aligning with Trump keeps him in the headlines. It‚Äôs good for his brand. It‚Äôs good for business. People love controversy, and Musk, just like Trump, knows how to give the media what it craves. The more attention Musk gets, the more likely it is that his projects get the support (and funding) they need.

Another layer here might be Musk‚Äôs frustration with Silicon Valley‚Äôs left-leaning culture. He‚Äôs made no secret of his beef with the region‚Äôs growing political correctness, which he sees as stifling innovation. Supporting Trump‚Äîwho represents everything Silicon Valley isn‚Äôt‚Äîmight be Musk‚Äôs way of sticking it to the very place that helped build his empire. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not playing by your rules anymore.‚Äù In a weird way, supporting Trump could be Musk‚Äôs way of rejecting the Silicon Valley elite that he thinks has become out of touch with reality.

And then, let‚Äôs not forget the personal side of things. Musk and Trump have had interactions over the years, and while they‚Äôre not exactly best buds, there‚Äôs a mutual respect there. Trump has always praised Musk‚Äôs ventures, and Musk has shown some admiration for Trump‚Äôs business success. It might be as simple as that‚Äîtwo big personalities who, despite their differences, can respect what the other has achieved.

So, why is Musk all in on Trump? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as simple as just politics. I think it‚Äôs about seeing Trump as a vehicle for disrupting the system, securing a business-friendly environment, and maintaining his place in the media spotlight. Musk‚Äôs always looking ahead, and if he thinks Trump can help him shape the future the way he wants it to be shaped‚Äîless regulation, more innovation, more space for the private sector to do its thing‚Äîthen supporting him makes perfect sense.

At the end of the day, though, I think Musk is just doing what he does best: betting on what he believes will push humanity forward, even if it‚Äôs not always the most popular choice. And yeah, in typical Musk fashion, it‚Äôs bound to ruffle some feathers. But when has he ever cared about that?",TSLA,Tesla

2024-10-03,15:37:11,Investing_Discussion,The Ultimate Beginner's Guide to Value Investing: How to Find Undervalued Stocks and Build Long-Term Wealth,"Value investing is finding undervalued stocks and holding them long term. Legendary investors like Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham have used this method to build their fortunes. Here's a quick rundown on how you can start too!

  
TLDR: Value investing is about patience, discipline, and doing your research. It‚Äôs not a get-rich-quick strategy, but it‚Äôs a proven path to building long-term wealth. By learning how to find undervalued companies, you‚Äôll be positioning yourself for steady, compounding growth over the years.



What is Value Investing?

Value investing is all about buying quality stocks that are trading below their true worth (intrinsic value). It's not just about buying cheap stocks‚Äîit's about finding good companies that the market is currently underpricing. Over time, as the market recognizes the real value, the stock price increases, and you reap the rewards.

Don't buy stocks only cause they drop sharply recently - find the opportunity to get into good company. 



Key Principles:

1. Find Intrinsic Value: What‚Äôs the real worth of the company based on fundamentals like earnings, cash flow, and assets?

2. Margin of Safety: Buy stocks at a discount to their intrinsic value, minimizing your risk.

3. Patience: It‚Äôs a long-term game. Hold until the market recognizes the stock‚Äôs true value.

4. How to Find Undervalued Stocks



Look at Key Ratios:

- P/E Ratio: A low Price-to-Earnings ratio could signal an undervalued stock.

- P/B Ratio: A Price-to-Book ratio below 1 often indicates the stock is cheaper than the company's assets.

- Debt-to-Equity: A low debt-to-equity ratio means the company isn‚Äôt overleveraged.

- Check Financial Health: Read the company‚Äôs financial statements‚Äîespecially the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Make sure the company isn‚Äôt drowning in debt and has strong free cash flow.

- Competitive Advantage: Look for companies with a ""moat""‚Äîsomething that gives them a strong competitive edge, like brand strength (Coca-Cola) or network effects (Meta).



Pro Tips for Success

- Stick to Industries You Understand: If you don‚Äôt understand how a business makes money, it‚Äôs harder to value it. Buffett don't hold much tech (mostly APPLE) because he dosn't understnd in it and prefer buying BAC. 

- Don‚Äôt Follow the Crowd: Buy when others are fearful. Avoid hype stocks.

- Reinvest Dividends: If a company pays dividends, reinvest them to maximize your returns over time.

- Diversify: Even with value stocks, don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Buffett likes to buy a small number of stocks (not just one) that he truly believes in. Don't just buy lots of stock for ""diversify"". 



Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Ignoring Fundamentals: Don‚Äôt get swayed by short-term price moves. Focus on the company‚Äôs financials. When market crashes take advantage and buy more!

- No Margin of Safety: Always buy with a cushion‚Äîthis lowers your risk.

- Overconfidence: Stay humble, and always be willing to learn!

# Moderna Is Feeling A Bit Sick‚Ä¶

**Cost Cutting Mode**  
Moderna‚Äôs getting out the scissors. The biotech giant announced plans to cut its R&D budget by $1.1 billion over the next three years as it faces the harsh reality of slumping vaccine sales. The company is pulling the plug on five programs and slowing down late-stage trials to rein in costs. Translation: it‚Äôs aiming to survive the post-COVID world by focusing on 10 key product launches by 2027. But there‚Äôs a catch‚ÄîModerna‚Äôs break-even target just got pushed back two years, from 2026 to 2028.

**Investors to Moderna: Not Impressed**  
Wall Street took one look at that plan and said, ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù Shares tanked over 12%, marking a rough day for a stock that‚Äôs already down 20% this year. While Moderna claims it‚Äôs exercising ""financial discipline"" by scaling back, investors are skeptical. They‚Äôre wondering if this is less about discipline and more about desperation. The company‚Äôs revenue projections for next year didn‚Äôt help either, coming in way below analysts' expectations. Some are questioning whether Moderna can make it to 2028 without asking for more cash from shareholders.

**So, What‚Äôs Next?**  
Moderna is betting big on 10 new products, with vaccines for flu, RSV, and a combo flu-COVID shot leading the charge. The company‚Äôs pipeline also includes some cancer treatments, but fast-tracking those approvals has hit a snag with regulators. Still, Moderna is pushing forward, expecting these new launches to drive growth. However, don‚Äôt expect any major cash infusions until at least 2025‚Äîrevenue contributions from these new products are likely a couple of years away.

**The Bigger Picture**  
This isn‚Äôt just about tightening the belt. Moderna‚Äôs once high-flying COVID vaccine sales have fallen to earth, forcing the company to recalibrate. Its COVID cash cow dried up faster than expected, and competition in the vaccine space is heating up. Now, the company is left navigating a landscape that‚Äôs looking a lot less certain. CEO St√©phane Bancel insists that they won‚Äôt need to raise equity, but investors aren‚Äôt convinced.

Moderna‚Äôs ‚Äúpivot‚Äù may sound like a savvy long-term strategy, but in the short term, it‚Äôs raising a lot of eyebrows. With revenue projections looking iffy and product launches still a few years out, the biotech darling has some convincing to do if it wants to regain Wall Street‚Äôs trust. Until then, it‚Äôs all about survival‚Äîand cutting those R&D costs is just the beginning.

# Oracle‚Äôs Big Cloud Dreams ‚Äî $104 Billion Sales by 2029

Oracle has its eyes on the clouds‚Ä¶ and a lot of cash. The software giant just upped its forecast, predicting at least $104 billion in annual revenue by fiscal 2029, thanks to the rapid growth of its cloud infrastructure business. This ambitious target was laid out by Executive VP Doug Kehring during Oracle‚Äôs annual analyst briefing, where the company also raised its fiscal 2026 sales outlook to $66 billion, beating analyst estimates by $1.5 billion.

**Cloud Wars Heating Up**  
Oracle‚Äôs game plan? Keep expanding its cloud services to compete with the likes of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. The company has been gaining traction in cloud infrastructure, particularly with generative AI workloads, boasting high-profile clients like Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI. Oracle‚Äôs strategy also includes making its database software easier to run on rival platforms‚Äîa move it hopes will help migrate its on-premise customers to the cloud, a key pillar of its growth strategy.

**The Numbers Game**  
Oracle‚Äôs stock is having a banner year, up 55% so far, trailing only Nvidia among the tech giants. Shares jumped another 6% following the updated revenue forecast, capping off a good week that saw the stock surge 15% over three trading sessions. CEO Safra Catz was confident about hitting these targets, citing partnerships with cloud heavyweights like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft to help boost Oracle‚Äôs cloud revenue, which has already grown by 45% in the latest quarter.

**Eyes on AI**  
Oracle‚Äôs not just riding the cloud wave‚Äîit‚Äôs betting big on AI, too. The company announced it‚Äôs taking orders for a massive cluster of Nvidia‚Äôs next-gen GPUs, which could solidify its place in the AI race. And as capital expenditures are set to double in fiscal 2025, Oracle‚Äôs banking on both cloud and AI to keep the revenue train rolling.

# Adobe‚Äôs AI Ambitions Stumble ‚Äî Guidance Misses Mark

# By the Numbers:

* **$5.5B - $5.55B**: Adobe's revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, falling short of analysts‚Äô $5.6B expectations.
* **8%**: Adobe‚Äôs drop in extended trading after the guidance miss.
* **11%**: Increase in third-quarter revenue to $5.41B.
* **$4.65**: Adobe‚Äôs third-quarter profit per share, beating estimates of $4.53.
* **$550M**: Net new digital media subscriptions, slightly below the $561M forecast.

Adobe has been busy rolling out AI tools like Firefly in its creative software, but investors are still waiting for that AI magic to show up in the company‚Äôs numbers. On Thursday, the software giant reported revenue for the upcoming quarter that fell short of Wall Street‚Äôs lofty expectations. The company expects revenue between $5.5 billion and $5.55 billion, slightly below the $5.6 billion analysts had predicted. In after-hours trading, the stock dropped 8%, leaving investors unimpressed.

**Strong Results, But Not Strong Enough**  
Adobe‚Äôs third-quarter numbers weren‚Äôt bad by any stretch‚Äîsales jumped 11% to $5.41 billion, and profit topped estimates at $4.65 per share. The company‚Äôs core digital media business, which includes its AI-infused Creative Cloud, also grew 11%. However, guidance for the fourth quarter disappointed, leaving many to wonder when the much-hyped AI features will start meaningfully boosting revenue.

**AI Hype vs. Reality**  
Adobe has been aggressively adding AI capabilities to its software lineup, hoping to cash in on the generative AI trend. But investors were banking on seeing bigger results by now, and the slower-than-expected adoption of AI tools like Firefly has some worried. Competitors like Canva have already hiked prices for AI features, putting pressure on Adobe to follow suit‚Äîalthough such changes could take quarters, if not years, to fully materialize.

**Price Hikes and Patience**  
Adobe is looking for ways to monetize its AI features, but price increases for its software take time to roll out to all customers. Meanwhile, its key metric of net new digital media subscriptions came in at $550 million, slightly below estimates, adding to investor jitters. Despite all the hype surrounding AI, Adobe‚Äôs leadership insists the company is just scratching the surface of what these innovations can do.

**The Takeaway**  
For now, it seems Adobe‚Äôs AI-driven future is more about potential than actual results. With shares down 8% after the guidance miss, investors are growing impatient for the promised AI uplift. As the company continues to invest in generative AI, the question remains: when will it start paying off in a big way?

# Google Back in the Hot Seat ‚Äî The Antitrust Saga Continues

The Justice Department is back for round two with Google, and this time it‚Äôs all about ad-tech. Weeks after a judge ruled the tech behemoth was illegally dominating search, another trial kicks off, this time in Virginia, targeting Google‚Äôs stronghold on digital advertising technology. The lawsuit claims Google has an unlawful monopoly over tools that buy and sell digital ads‚Äîtools that are essential for keeping online publishers afloat.

# The Case: Google‚Äôs Ad-Tech Monopoly?

The trial, expected to last several weeks, aims to determine whether Google‚Äôs control of both the buy-side and sell-side of the ad-tech ecosystem is crushing competition. The Justice Department, backed by 17 states, argues that Google‚Äôs practices have locked out rivals, with advertisers and publishers feeling forced to use its tools. They‚Äôre demanding Google shed its Ad Manager, which generated $368 million in profits from $7.4 billion in revenue in 2020 alone.

This isn‚Äôt the first time Google has been hit with monopoly claims. A federal judge recently ruled that Google illegally maintained dominance in search, but this case could potentially cut deeper. If Google loses, it might have to sell off key parts of its advertising business, which is crucial to Alphabet‚Äôs overall revenue‚Äî78% of its $307 billion annual earnings come from advertising.

# Google‚Äôs Defense: The Market Has Changed

In response, Google claims the Justice Department is stuck in the past, focusing on outdated desktop advertising models while consumer attention has shifted to mobile apps, social media, and streaming platforms like TikTok and Peacock. Google‚Äôs legal team insists that the ad-tech space is more competitive than ever, with alternatives like Microsoft and Amazon gaining ground.

But the trial has already hit some bumps for Google. The company is facing scrutiny for allegedly deleting internal chat messages relevant to the case, something the judge criticized as ""not the way a responsible corporate entity should function."" This issue could factor into how the court weighs the credibility of witnesses.

# What‚Äôs Next for Google?

The trial, held without a jury, could significantly alter Google‚Äôs ad-tech empire. A government win would likely mean divesting parts of Google‚Äôs ad business, untangling years of acquisitions. With Google‚Äôs advertising technology so deeply embedded in the digital landscape, this case could reshape the industry for advertisers and publishers alike. And with antitrust regulators in both the U.S. and Europe breathing down its neck, Google‚Äôs struggles are far from over.

This is just the beginning of a legal battle that could send shockwaves through Big Tech.

With interest rate cuts all but certain, the key question now is: how big will the cut be? The answer hinges on two upcoming inflation reports‚Äîthe Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI). These reports are expected to clarify the Fed‚Äôs next move, especially after Friday‚Äôs jobs report provided little guidance.

# CPI & PPI: The Deciding Factors

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release August‚Äôs CPI report, followed by the PPI on Thursday. Economists are predicting a 0.2% monthly increase for both headline and core CPI, bringing annual inflation rates to 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively. The PPI is expected to mirror these figures. While the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation measure is the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, this week‚Äôs CPI and PPI readings will still play a crucial role in determining the size of the upcoming rate cut.

The debate is now centered on whether the Fed will opt for a modest 25-basis-point cut or go bigger with a 50-basis-point reduction. Futures markets currently favor a quarter-point cut, with odds hovering around 71%. However, a stronger-than-expected inflation reading could push the Fed toward a more aggressive move. Economists like Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, believe inflation data should be favorable for at least a small cut.

# Shifting Focus: From Inflation to Jobs

While inflation has been the Fed's main concern for months, the focus is now turning toward the labor market. Hiring has slowed significantly, with nonfarm payroll gains averaging just 135,000 per month since April, down from 255,000 in the prior five months. Job openings have also declined, raising fears that the labor market is weakening. This shift has increased expectations that the Fed will begin cutting rates sooner rather than later, starting with a baby step at the next meeting.

# What‚Äôs Next?

After this week‚Äôs inflation reports, all eyes will be on the Fed‚Äôs September 18 meeting. If the data shows more progress in curbing inflation, the central bank may lean toward a larger rate cut. But even if the Fed starts small, markets expect more cuts to follow, with a possible half-point reduction in November and another in December. As the Fed navigates these murky waters, the balance between taming inflation and supporting a cooling labor market will guide its next moves.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Inflation‚Äôs about to take center stage again. Tomorrow, we get the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) report‚Äîaka, the data that shows how much more (or less) expensive life has gotten over the past year. While the Fed has plenty of tools to gauge inflation, CPI is the star of the show‚Äîespecially core CPI, which leaves out the drama of volatile food and energy prices.

Economists are penciling in a 0.2% rise for August, same as July‚Äôs bump. If that holds, it would push annual inflation down from 2.9% to 2.6%. Core inflation is also expected to clock in at 3.2% year-over-year. If these numbers land as predicted, the Fed will probably have the green light to trim rates by 25 basis points at next week‚Äôs meeting.

# Google Back in the Hot Seat ‚Äî The Antitrust Saga Continues

The Justice Department is back for round two with Google, and this time it‚Äôs all about ad-tech. Weeks after a judge ruled the tech behemoth was illegally dominating search, another trial kicks off, this time in Virginia, targeting Google‚Äôs stronghold on digital advertising technology. The lawsuit claims Google has an unlawful monopoly over tools that buy and sell digital ads‚Äîtools that are essential for keeping online publishers afloat.

# The Case: Google‚Äôs Ad-Tech Monopoly?

The trial, expected to last several weeks, aims to determine whether Google‚Äôs control of both the buy-side and sell-side of the ad-tech ecosystem is crushing competition. The Justice Department, backed by 17 states, argues that Google‚Äôs practices have locked out rivals, with advertisers and publishers feeling forced to use its tools. They‚Äôre demanding Google shed its Ad Manager, which generated $368 million in profits from $7.4 billion in revenue in 2020 alone.

This isn‚Äôt the first time Google has been hit with monopoly claims. A federal judge recently ruled that Google illegally maintained dominance in search, but this case could potentially cut deeper. If Google loses, it might have to sell off key parts of its advertising business, which is crucial to Alphabet‚Äôs overall revenue‚Äî78% of its $307 billion annual earnings come from advertising.

# Google‚Äôs Defense: The Market Has Changed

In response, Google claims the Justice Department is stuck in the past, focusing on outdated desktop advertising models while consumer attention has shifted to mobile apps, social media, and streaming platforms like TikTok and Peacock. Google‚Äôs legal team insists that the ad-tech space is more competitive than ever, with alternatives like Microsoft and Amazon gaining ground.

But the trial has already hit some bumps for Google. The company is facing scrutiny for allegedly deleting internal chat messages relevant to the case, something the judge criticized as ""not the way a responsible corporate entity should function."" This issue could factor into how the court weighs the credibility of witnesses.

# What‚Äôs Next for Google?

The trial, held without a jury, could significantly alter Google‚Äôs ad-tech empire. A government win would likely mean divesting parts of Google‚Äôs ad business, untangling years of acquisitions. With Google‚Äôs advertising technology so deeply embedded in the digital landscape, this case could reshape the industry for advertisers and publishers alike. And with antitrust regulators in both the U.S. and Europe breathing down its neck, Google‚Äôs struggles are far from over.

This is just the beginning of a legal battle that could send shockwaves through Big Tech.

I'm from Germany, and we start something like an apprenticeship for 3 years at the age of 16. You work 40h a week though you alternate between work and a school meant to combine theory and practice and prepare you for an actual job in the field you did the apprenticeship in.

My employer offers capital accumulation benefits of 40‚Ç¨/$44 a month. I've decided to put this,essentially,free money into an investment fund. As I am gonna be working in the banking industry,I don't gave to pay any additional fees to a investment fund including a stock depot,if that's the right word. I am using the UniGlobal offer.

Over the course of at least 6 years,these 40 euros go to the fund,which picks and buys stocks of different branches,something like ETFs. Right now, 70% of all stocks bought come from the IT branch, so from companies like Apple,Amazon,NVIDIA etc.

What stocks are bought are influenced by worldly events,so during the covid epidemic,mostly Medical and Pharmaceutical stocks were getting bought. 

After 6 years of paying in, I can freely access the depot and do whatever I want with the money. I can keep putting money in or sell everything off,though I will probably do the former.

My question is if you guys think that this is a good choice, as my only other 2 options were putting the money into a retirement account/fund or a savings contract. There is obviously risk involved but i am confident in it working out for the better. I ak still pretty young and would appreciate others' opinions on this.

2024-08-06,12:11:54,Investing_Discussion,"Question! New to trading, need help understanding a recent order","Hi, super new to actively trading and investing and pretty bad at understanding money in general. I got a bunch of stock from AAPL through years of being an employee and tried to sell some because I'm really tight on money right now and this is my only source. Sold 36 shares. Didn't realize it was saturday and not friday like a fool so i had to wait until monday morning for the sale to execute in the app (etrade) and that's when the value dipped. Thing is that when the order was executed, the value was only roughly 5% less than when I originally made the order. The order went through at 9:45 on monday for $199 so the estimated net proceeds was a little above $7k, and all the history in the app shows me that number, but I got a notification at 4 am tuesday that the order was settled and only $5.4k was put into my account. Capital gains status was long term. 

Where did the rest of the money go? Tax? Fees? I can't find anything in the app that shows any paper trail or explanation and Google isn't really helping. I don't know where this nearly 25% shortfall is coming from. I haven't heard of this happening to any of my friends selling their stock and the only person I know who might know is horrible at explaining. I am at least good at math so if I could get at least something I can google to understand and then run the numbers myself so I can verify why the amount is supposed to be that much It would be much appreciated. 

TL;DR Sold stock expecting one profit, different amount was deposited into account. No amount of digging through transaction history, order history, or documents available in app provide any numbers that explain why.

Edit: Managed to reach out after a few transfers over the phone. They aren't sure, but the most likely thing is tax withholding because of a discrepancy in my name on file vs the name my employer provided when making the account. Won't know until 2-3 business days from now after sending in a bunch of identification docs and forms. Will keep updated.",AAPL,Apple

 I am running into a problem tho : 
In the apple published 2019 annual report (10-k) the basic EPS is 11.97, and the diluted one id 11.89.
 Same goes for 2018 where it‚Äôs 12.01 and 11.91 respectively. 
And also for 2017 where it‚Äôs 9.27 and 9.21 respectively.
When i search on macro-trend and yahoo finance for the eps basic and diluted, and they gave me very different results: no more than $3.00 eps basic or diluted. 
I don‚Äôt know if I should stick with the apple reports or i should go for the yahoo and macro trend results. 
Essentially I got suspicious because of the huge decline from $11 to $12 eps in 2018-2019 to $2.32 and $3.00 in 2020-2021. Now i know corona virus was devastating but this much?

I am using these information to find key metric and ratios that make great companies great. It‚Äôs a big basic eps jump from $12 to 3$ according to the apple annual report, and a small jump from $3 to $2.32 eps basic according to macro trend and yahoo finance.This will alter everything in term of the key metric and ratio change that i will be taking as a great indication for a good company.

Kering is therefore a global luxury group that manages the development of a range of renowned brands in fashion, leather goods and jewelry.

The company was founded in 1963 and is known for its luxury fashion and accessories brands such as Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga. In this piece, we will discover how Kering was founded, how the company has developed over the years, and which key moments in the company's history have contributed to its current success.

# Why Kerings moat is questionable

Kering, a prominent player in the luxury goods market, has built its reputation based on brands like Gucci, Saint Laurent, and Balenciaga. However, despite its impressive portfolio and strategic acquisitions, Kering's competitive advantage appears to be on shaky ground. Just take a look at its returns over the past 5 years.

https://preview.redd.it/s3hnmkgnt1fd1.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=208868c28a2febf62bdf95c29597dc77695764a1

The luxury market is defined by several unique characteristics:

* Brand recognition;
* Customer loyalty
* Heritage.

These elements are of the utmost importance for establishing and maintaining a (durable) competitive advantage. Kering's strategy largely depends on taking advantage of these intangible assets across its various brands. However, the strength of Kering‚Äôs competitive advantage varies greatly among its brands.

Kering's primary competitive advantage lies in its strong brands, but not all of them are equally robust. Gucci, which accounts for a significant portion of Kering‚Äôs revenue, has recently shown signs of weakening brand strength. While Gucci remains one of the most recognizable names in luxury fashion, its appeal has been declining, as evidenced by a drop in sales and market share, which we talk about more in depth in our [Kering research report.](https://www.thedutchinvestors.com/premium-analyses) The brand value of Gucci amounted to approximately 17.8 billion dollars in 2023, a slight decrease of around 300 million dollars compared to the previous year.[1](#footnote-1) Just to show how strong of a brand, Gucci (still) is:

1. Gucci is one of the top luxury brands globally, ranking high among its peers. Interbrand has it ranked fourth in the world, behind Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and Herm√®s.
2. It generates over $10 billion in annual revenue with more than 500 stores in over 50 countries.
3. Gucci leads luxury brands on social media, boasting over 40 million followers on Instagram.
4. Celebrities like Beyonc√©, Rihanna, and Jennifer Lopez frequently wear Gucci.
5. Gucci often features in popular films and TV shows, highlighting its iconic status.

# So what‚Äôs Gucci‚Äôs (and Kerings) problem?

# Problem 1: not the same level of ‚Äòluxury‚Äô

Compared to other luxury giants like LVMH and Herm√®s, Kering‚Äôs brands, particularly Gucci, do not exhibit the same level of resilience and customer loyalty. Herm√®s is known for being exclusive and luxurious. They have a sizable base of devoted customers who are unaffected by the economy. The popularity of Gucci is changing, which raises questions about its long-term viability as a premium luxury brand.

# Problem 2: economies of scale are not the same strength

One of Kering‚Äôs advantages is its ability to achieve economies of scale and synergies through its portfolio of brands. The company can negotiate better rates for advertising, marketing, real estate and other operational expenses, benefiting from its size. However, these economies of scale are not exclusive to Kering, and competitors such as LVMH, Richemont, or even Herm√®s also benefit from these advantages, often more effectively.

**Problem 3: not all brands are performing well**

Kering‚Äôs strategy of allowing each brand to maintain its unique identity while benefiting from shared resources is a good one. Yet, the execution appears inconsistent. For instance, while Saint Laurent (YSL) and Bottega Veneta have shown some growth, other brands within Kering‚Äôs portfolio, such as Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen, have not performed as well, dragging down the overall performance.

Kering's significant stock price decline by 60% reflects the market‚Äôs growing skepticism about the company's ability to sustain its competitive edge and the future of its flagship brand, Gucci. The key question is whether Gucci can regain its position as a leading luxury brand, or if it is destined to become merely a premium brand. If Gucci fails to reclaim its luxury status, it risks being perceived as a premium brand rather than a luxury one. This shift could be disastrous.

Is Gucci capable of reclaiming its luxury status, or will it have to contend with a premium future? Please let us know what you think!

2024-06-10,15:53:46,Investing_Discussion,"Atlas Lithium to Co-Host Inaugural Brazil Lithium Summit, Showcasing Strategic Partnerships","came across some interesting news last week, thought id share

Atlas Lithium Corporation (NASDAQ: ATLX), a prominent lithium exploration and development company, announced its co-hosting of the inaugural Brazil Lithium Summit! 

This event, showcasing Brazil's lithium potential, endorsed by Invest Minas, the state government investment agency, the Summit will serve as a key platform for industry leaders and international companies to connect with regional decision-makers and global investors... Marc Fogassa, CEO and Chairman of Atlas Lithium, will introduce the event and moderate a panel discussion, which includes Ernie Ortiz, CEO of Lithium Royalty Corporation (LRC). In May 2023, LRC invested $20 million in Atlas Lithium.

Highlighting the partnership between Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Atlas Lithium, several senior managers from Mitsui will attend the Summit. Mitsui purchased $30 million of Atlas Lithium's common shares in March 2024, along with an offtake agreement for lithium concentrate from Atlas Lithium's Neves Project. This significant transaction, following eighteen months of due diligence, emphasizes Atlas Lithium's potential as an emerging lithium supplier.

In December 2023, Atlas Lithium secured investments and offtake agreements with Chengxin and Yahua, major players in lithium chemical processing. Chengxin supplies BYD, a leading EV maker, while Yahua supplies Tesla. These partnerships position Atlas Lithium as a key player in the lithium supply chain for the growing electric vehicle industry. Nicholas Rowley, Vice President of Business Development, noted that these investments reflect the strong relationships and track record of the Atlas Lithium team.

Atlas Lithium's processing plant is nearing completion and remains on schedule to start production in the fourth quarter of 2024. Through strategic investments and partnerships, Atlas Lithium aims to take a leadership role in the local market and integrate into the global lithium supply chain.

* **Current Savings:**¬†I have $10,000 ready to invest.
* **Investment Suggestions:**¬†I've talked to people who regularly invest, and they suggested putting my money into VOO, VTI, and SPY, and being regular with my investments.
* **Investment Plan:**¬†I was thinking of dividing the $10,000 equally into these three index funds (VOO, VTI, SPY). However, I‚Äôm also considering investing in individual stocks like Nvidia, Google, Amazon, and Meta along with VOO, VTI, and SPY.
* **Location:**¬†I live in the USA.
* **Income:**¬†My take-home salary after all deductions is $5,200 per month.
* **Monthly Investment:**¬†I plan to invest around $800-$1,000 every month in addition to the initial $10,000.
* **Current Holdings:**¬†I do not have any specific current holdings.
* **Regrets:**¬†One thing I regret is not investing in Nvidia back in 2022.
* **Debts:**¬†I do not have any debts.

2024-04-03,05:13:11,Investing_Discussion,Investing in a company and focusing on its people,"Tesla's recent delivery figures might have left many feeling disappointed, some even suggested that this might be the potential bursting of an EV bubble within the industry. However, history would prove a different viewpoint. Just like any emerging sector, the electric vehicle (EV) industry is undergoing a natural evolution from infancy to maturity.

Drawing parallels between this phase of EV development and the early days of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars is akin to suggesting that horses were preferable in areas lacking gas stations. Today, the EV market has advanced considerably compared to the nascent stages of ICE vehicles. Tesla's extensive charging infrastructure now offers rapid charging times of approximately 25 minutes to reach 80% capacity, with a range spanning around 260 miles (depending on the model).

Furthermore, the driving experience of EVs has been transformed by cutting-edge features such as lane departure alerts and Full Self-Driving (FSD) capabilities. FSD enables impressive functionalities like corner turning, lane switching, self-parking, and adept navigation of stop signs.

The cost of ownership and maintenance for EVs is significantly lower, with no need for oil changes and savings on gasoline costs. Tesla's regenerative braking technology further diminishes wear on brakes. Although concerns may arise regarding reduced range in single-digit winter temperatures, ongoing advancements in battery technology offer promise for future improvements.

Ultimately, while Tesla's recent delivery figures may have fallen short of some expectations, the broader landscape of the EV industry showcases resilience and innovation, firmly establishing it as a transformative force in the future of transportation.

When it comes to investment, there's a saying in Silicon Valley: ""You can bet against anyone, but not Elon Musk.""

2024-03-07,05:57:03,Investing_Discussion,What do you think about my strategy ,"Hi, I would like to hear your opinions on my investment strategy:

To provide some context, I'm 19 years old and about to start investing. I've developed the following strategy: investing in stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), etc., exclusively through an S&P 500 ETF. This means that throughout the duration of my investment, I won't directly invest in these companies as they are already predominantly included in the S&P 500 ETF.

Additionally, I plan to implement a dividend strategy focusing on market leaders present for at least 30 years, such as Coca-Cola, LVMH, PepsiCo, Walmart, etc. I intend to invest in each leader based on its sector.

What do you think of this strategy, which, in summary, involves buying S&P 500 ETFs and complementing them with stocks of well-established companies for at least 30 years, paying increasing dividends each year?

In my opinion, this strategy seems interesting as it allows me to benefit from the growth of major companies through S&P 500 ETFs while complementing them with dividend-paying stocks from renowned companies. It avoids direct stock picking on major American companies while capitalizing on their growth. Furthermore, this approach will enable me to reinvest dividends in each major company, such as LVMH, PepsiCo, etc.

Of course, as it's a strategy I plan to adopt, it seems perfect for me. However, I'd appreciate feedback from more experienced investors to identify any potential long-term flaws.",AAPL,Apple

I've developed the following strategy: investing in stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), etc., exclusively through an S&P 500 ETF. This means that throughout the duration of my investment, I won't directly invest in these companies as they are already predominantly included in the S&P 500 ETF.

Additionally, I plan to implement a dividend strategy focusing on market leaders present for at least 30 years, such as Coca-Cola, LVMH, PepsiCo, Walmart, etc. I intend to invest in each leader based on its sector.

What do you think of this strategy, which, in summary, involves buying S&P 500 ETFs and complementing them with stocks of well-established companies for at least 30 years, paying increasing dividends each year?

In my opinion, this strategy seems interesting as it allows me to benefit from the growth of major companies through S&P 500 ETFs while complementing them with dividend-paying stocks from renowned companies. It avoids direct stock picking on major American companies while capitalizing on their growth. Furthermore, this approach will enable me to reinvest dividends in each major company, such as LVMH, PepsiCo, etc.

Of course, as it's a strategy I plan to adopt, it seems perfect for me. However, I'd appreciate feedback from more experienced investors to identify any potential long-term flaws.",MC.PA,LVMH

2024-01-25,19:39:19,Investing_Discussion,One common mistake of a novice trader,"Let's imagine the mindset of beginners. Beginners want to earn quickly, a lot and with minimal effort. And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.

**How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**  
Let's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.  
**What is wrong with that?**  
The point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.  
**What does good or bad timing mean?**  
In investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.  
For the sake of simplicity let's consider 2 companies: META and AAPL.   
Both of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading, but you should not buy both companies now, if you take them for a short term.  
The fact is that META and AAPL stocks are at their all-time highs right now. They have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected. Since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line. There will always come moments of correction. And if you buy their stocks now, you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times.  
That's why it's important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly.",AAPL,Apple

2024-01-13,12:56:26,Investing_Discussion,Answer to 60% of questions asked here.,"There are many posts here about how to start investing and what to invest in.  
The answer is usually the same: approximately 80% in the S&P 500, 10% in riskier assets, 5% in something you like (e.g., Tesla), and 5% in crypto. There are many exceptions, but this covers the majority of the questions posted here.

  
The answer is always similar, and the process can be automated.  
I can create a website/questionnaire that asks you questions like:

  
\* Your current financial situation  
\* Opinions on crypto and AI  
\* Causes you want to support, if any  
\* Predictions and opinions about the future  
\* Support for a presidential candidate, or a side in a conflict  
\* Hobbies and interests

  
This can be automated in the future with open banking, etc.  
And you get an output such as:

  
Based on your answers, you will be most happy with the following portfolio:

  
\- S&P 500 - 80% (based on your risk profile calculated from your savings, salary, industry you work in)  
\- Intuitive Surgical, Inc., and Teradyne, Inc. - 2% (based on the fact that you believe AI used in robots will revolutionise the economy)  
\- Aerotyne International - 5%, a cutting-edge technology firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on a new generation of radar detectors. Etc.  
Let me know what you think. If the feedback is more or less positive, I will start building it.

However, for the entire year, Tesla still outpaced BYD, selling 1.8 million electric cars compared to BYD's 1.57 million. Although Tesla‚Äôs deliveries have consistently grown quarter after quarter, the rapid growth of BYD in recent years might potentially catch up with Tesla and challenge its dominance in the EV industry.
